5510,"Self-medication in insects: when altered behaviors of infected insects are a defense instead of a parasite manipulation","de Roode, J.C. and Hunter, M.D.","Current Opinion in Insect Science","22145745","33","","1-6","2019","","10.1016/j.cois.2018.12.001","Studies have demonstrated that medication behaviors by insects are much more common than previously thought. Bees, ants, flies, and butterflies can use a wide range of toxic and nutritional compounds to medicate themselves or their genetic kin. Medication occurs either in response to active infection (therapy) or high infection risk (prophylaxis), and can be used to increase resistance or tolerance to infection. While much progress has been made over the last few years, there are also key areas that require in-depth investigation. These include quantifying the costs of medication, especially at the colony level of social insects, and formulating theoretical models that can predict the role of infection risk in driving micro-evolutionary and macro-evolutionary patterns of animal medication behaviors.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

To test the effectiveness of nutritional components, the following food-derived compounds: curcumin alone (curcumin), curcumin combined with ()epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and -lipoic acid (ALA) (curcumin + EDA), or a combination of EGCG, DHA and ALA (EDA) were assessed in male Tg2576 transgenic mice on amyloid plaque load, amyloid levels (A40/A42, but not oligomers due to tissue limitations), microglial activation and memory using the contextual and cued fear conditioning test. The combination diet EDA, resulted in the strongest reduction of amyloid plaque load in both the cortical (p &lt;.0001) and hippocampal (p &lt;.0001) areas of the Tg2576 mouse brain, along with lower A40/A42 levels in the frontal cortex (p =.000129 and p =.000039, respectively) and A42 levels in the temporal lobe (p =.000082). A curcumin only diet was shown to lower amyloid plaque load (p =.028), but when combined with EGCG, DHA and ALA did not result in further decreases in amyloid plaque load. The EDA combination group showed the most prominent decrease in microglial activation (number of microglia around plaques: p &lt;.05 and p &lt;.0001, respectively, for the cortex and hippocampus). Analysing the hippocampal associated contextual fear conditioning revealed that both the curcumin+EDA (p &lt;.0001) and EDA groups (p =.001) spent increased time on freezing compared to the control group. In addition, the curcumin+EDA group showed a significant increase in time spent freezing compared with the curcumin only group. In the amygdala associated cued test, all mice demonstrated the ability to associate the conditioned stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus as evidenced by a significant increase in freezing behaviour in response to the presentation of the cue (p &lt;.0001). Post-hoc analysis showed that only curcumin+EDA (p &lt;.0001) and EDA groups (p &lt;.0001) developed a significant increase in freezing during the cue presentation. The results from this study show that the combination of EGCG, DHA and ALA (EDA) appeared to have the most potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect. Our results also demonstrate that interactions between nutraceutical products might result in counterproductive outcomes, highlighting the fact that manufacturers of nutraceuticals containing multiple compounds should be careful not to claim additive or synergistic effects of their combination products in vivo without having tested it in animal models and/or human clinical trials.  2018"

Effective after-school programs could positively impact both physical activity and overweight/obesity, however previous reviews and meta-analyses have indicated minimal effects. Both 4- and 3-day/week versions of a social cognitive theory-driven physical activity/nutrition after-school program were evaluated against unstructured care to assess effects in children (overall Mage = 10.00 years, SD =.80). For changes over 9 months in body mass index (BMI), effects sizes (Cohen's d) were.68,.40, and.07 in the 4-day (n = 70), 3-day (n = 70), and unstructured (n = 50) groups, respectively. Similar patterns of effects were found for changes in free-time physical activity and cardiovascular endurance. Incorporating a theory-based prediction model previously supported in teens through older adults, with and without medical disorders and health-risk factors, improvements in exercise-related self-regulation and self-efficacy, and mood, significantly predicted increased free-time physical activity (R2 =.48). Effects significantly strengthened to R2 =.62 when completion/non-completion of the recommended 300 min/week of physical activity was also accounted for.

Internet-based programs offer great potential for the implementation of evidence-based interventions focused on promoting healthy habits. We evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based self-administered program (Living Better) that addresses people diagnosed as being overweight or having type I obesity and hypertension. Methods: The sample was composed of a total of 106 participants (age Mean = 53; 59 males) from a public hospital in Spain, diagnosed as being overweight or having type I obesity and hypertension and randomized into two groupsthe intervention group (IG; Internet-based intervention) and the control group (CG; usual medical treatment). The intervention used cognitive-behavioral strategies and psychoeducation to promote healthy habits. Anthropometric data (i.e., Body Mass Index BMI-, waist circumference, and hip circumference) and lifestyle/psychological data (i.e., quality of life, physical activity, eating styles, motivation, mood, and self-efficacy) were assessed before and after the intervention, and at 6 and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Significant differences were observed between the IG and the CG in anthropometrical variables after intervention (i.e., BMI and waist circumference), external eating style, and anxiety and stress scores (p < 0.05). Follow-up data showed that changes were maintained in BMI, waist and hip circumference, and external eating in the IG. After receiving the Internet-based treatment, the CG also improved its clinical condition. Discussion: This study demonstrates that the Internet is a viable alternative for the delivery and dissemination of interventions focused on promoting healthy habits, and a totally self-administered intervention can produce long-term positive results.  2018 Elsevier B.V."

In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that bears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 35, 20122015) and random positions within the bear home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, but they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed bears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season.  2018 Gesellschaft fr kologie"

The adverse neuro-behavioural effects of Se have been investigated in both humans and fishes, but little is known about its effects on social behaviours or the serotonergic signaling pathway in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chorionic dietary exposure to Se (as selenomethionine) at different concentrations (control, 2.1, 11.6 or 31.5 g/g dry wt.) on antipredator avoidance, shoaling behaviour, and social group preferences in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, we also measured the expression of important genes in the serotonergic pathway that influence social behaviours. After 60 days of exposure, the highest dose (31.5 g/g dry wt.) caused the highest level of baseline fear behaviour, with fish swimming lower in the water column and in tighter shoals compared to fish in the other treatments. With high levels of baseline fear, these fish did not significantly intensify fear behaviours in response to predation risk in the form of exposure to chemical alarm cues. When individual fish were given an opportunity to shoal with groups of differing sizes (3 vs. 4 individuals), fish exposed to the high dose spent less time with groups in general, and only control fish showed a significant preference for the larger group. In the zebrafish brain, we found significant upregulation in the mRNA expression of serotonin receptors (htr1aa and htr1b), a transporter (slc6a4a), and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (tph2), whereas there was a downregulation of the monoamine oxidase (mao) gene. The results of this study suggest that disruption of serotonergic neurotransmission might have been responsible for Se-induced impairment of antipredator and social behaviour in zebrafish.  2018 Elsevier Ltd"
5516,"Current energy state interacts with the developmental environment to influence behavioural plasticity","Royaut, R. and Garrison, C. and Dalos, J. and Berdal, M.A. and Dochtermann, N.A.","Animal Behaviour","00033472","148","","39-51","2019","","10.1016/j.anbehav.2018.11.013","There is increasing evidence that among-individual differences in behaviour are, in part, generated by environmental effects. For example, diet quality can have drastically different effects on behavioural variation depending on whether it acts primarily during ontogeny (i.e. as a permanent environmental effect) or has an immediate effect on trait expression as a consequence of energy intake (i.e. temporary source of variation). Moreover, whether diet quality has a stronger effect on a trait's average expression, its variance or its covariance with other traits, remains unclear. We used a 2  2 factorial design crossing life stage (juvenile and adult) and diet quality (low- or high-energy content) to disentangle the effects of developmental and adult diets on the expression of behavioural differences. We tested 281 crickets for their activity levels, responses to predator cues and body mass. Neither developmental diet nor adulthood diet had any effect on population means or on the expression of an activityantipredator response syndrome, suggesting a genetic basis for this syndrome. We did find evidence for increases in the within-individual variance as a result of exposure to a high-quality diet. However, these increases were only found for antipredator response and body mass. This indicates that diets with higher energy content can increase the potential for behavioural plasticity in antipredator response. In addition to changes in within-individual variation in behaviour, diet quality during development also mediated the links between maturation time and exploratory behaviours. More exploratory crickets matured faster when exposed to the low-quality developmental diet, but this relation was absent in the high-quality diet treatment. Our results show that changes in developmental diet quality can mediate the relationship between life history and behavioural traits later in life.  2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Circumstantial descriptions of abnormal animal behavior during solar eclipses abound, although scientific studies conducted during an eclipse are relatively rare due to inherent logistical difficulties. Here, honey bee foraging and homing behavior were studied during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. In the first experiment, we studied foraging behavior of honey bees during the progression of the solar eclipse and found that the foraging activity drastically decreased but did not completely cease during the totality of the eclipse, in contrast to previous reports of complete cessation. The data indicate that the level of ambient light can largely overrule the internal circadian rhythm of foraging honey bees. Furthermore, colonies with a higher need for foraging decreased their foraging activity less than satiated colonies, consistent with the hypothesis that individual foraging decisions may be influenced by colony state, which affects cost-benefit analyses. In a second experiment, the temporal dynamics of homing of released workers and drones was compared in periods before, during, and after the solar eclipse. During the totality of the eclipse, very few bees arrived back at their hive, while homing before the total eclipse was accelerated, particularly in drones. The results suggest that, while the homing abilities of honey bees are not compromised until the sun is completely eclipsed, they may still interpret the diminishing light as an indicator of deteriorating flight conditions. Our unique study provides some insight into the control of honey bee foraging behavior when external cues and internal circadian rhythms are at odds, lent support to the notion that food deprivation can lead to riskier foraging, and indicated that homing in honey bees is possible even with very small amounts of sunlight.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Despite the widespread occurrence of florivorous insects and the important but often underrated ecological roles that they play, the study of florivore behaviour is neglected relative to that of pollinators and other herbivores. Specifically, we do not know how different personality types can develop among florivores and enable them to persist in habitats with an ephemeral and dynamic availability of food resources. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the following questions: whether the (a) inter-individual differences of exploration and boldness are consistent; (b) inter-population differences of exploration and boldness are consistent; (c) exploration and boldness are correlated. We collected individuals of the polyphagous floriphilic katydid, Phaneroptera brevis from four populations from wasteland sites in Singapore and performed a personality assay conducted in an insectary to investigate the exploratory and boldness levels of the individuals and populations. The major novel finding was that the floriphilic P.brevis katydids exhibit population-level personality types for boldness, but not for exploration. Some katydid individuals were consistently more exploratory and bolder than other individuals. However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find any evidence of behavioural syndromes in the katydid individuals, as the boldness level for individuals was not significantly correlated with exploration for individuals. This suggests that an individual which is more exploratory may not be equally keen to take risks and consume novel food that it encounters. Our findings also suggest that boldness and exploration are linked to ecologically important behaviours, but more studies are needed to better understand population-level personality and how and why natural selection may favour the evolution of personality in certain populations.  2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH"

Planktonic copepods display behavioral plasticity and small-scale behaviors associated with different foraging strategies that can affect starvation tolerance. However, little is still known about the influence of behavior on starvation tolerance in zooplankton. Here, we experimentally investigated behavioral changes and survival of planktonic copepods (adults and nauplii) with different foraging strategies under prolonged starvation. The behavioral response to starvation varied depending on the foraging strategy. The strict ambusher Oithona nana showed a low and, almost constant, motile activity (relocation jumps, <4% of the time) whereas the feeding-current feeder Temora longicornis swam for most of the time (~100%) without reducing their activity under prolonged starvation. The switching-behavior feeder Acartia tonsa move actively in the presence of food but had a low motile activity in absence of food (~12%) and decreased its motile activity during starvation (from ~12% to 3%). The observed behavioral responses to the absence of food can be broadly classified in terms of motility as: (i) sit-and-wait strategy for copepods with low motile activity under starvation (mostly relocation jumps) and (ii) searching strategy for copepods with high motility activity (swimming/cruising) under starvation. Median survival time in absence of food increased with increasing copepod body weight and it was ~1.75 fold lower in active feeders (searching strategy under starvation) than in ambush and switching-behavior feeders (sit-and-wait strategy under starvation). Thus, copepods with foraging strategies linked to a low motility (ambush feeders) and/or with behavioral plasticity to reduce motility in absence of food (switching -behavior feeders) would cope better with resource limitation/fluctuation than some active feeders. We demonstrate that behavioral plasticity and motile activity associated with foraging strategy significantly influences starvation tolerance in planktonic copepods. These results help to quantify the main trade-offs (gain vs costs) of the main zooplankton foraging strategies and emphasize that behavior is a key trait to understand the distribution of planktonic copepods in marine environments depending on trophic conditions.  2018 Elsevier B.V."

Evidence acquisition: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Ten databases were searched in 2014 for studies published after 1990 evaluating food labeling and consumer purchases/orders, intakes, metabolic risk factors, and industry responses. Data extractions were performed independently and in duplicate. Studies were pooled using inverse-variance random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored with I-2, stratified analyses, and meta-regression; and publication bias was assessed with funnel plots, Begg's tests, and Egger's tests. Analyses were completed in 2017. Evidence synthesis: From 6,232 articles, a total of 60 studies were identified, including 2 million observations across 111 intervention arms in 11 countries. Food labeling decreased consumer intakes of energy by 6.6\% (95\% CI= -8.8\%, -4.4\%, n=31), total fat by 10.6\% (95\% CI= -17.7\%, -3.5\%, n=13), and other unhealthy dietary options by 13.0\% (95\% CI= -25.7\%, -0.2\%, n=16), while increasing vegetable consumption by 13.5\% (95\% CI=2.4\%, 24.6\%, n=5). Evaluating industry responses, labeling decreased product contents of sodium by 8.9\% (95\% CI= -17.3\%, -0.6\%, n=4) and artificial trans fat by 64.3\% (95\% CI= -91.1\%, -37.5\%, n=3). No significant heterogeneity was identified by label placement or type, duration, labeled product, region, population, voluntary or legislative approaches, combined intervention components, study design, or quality. Evidence for publication bias was not identified. Conclusions: From reviewing 60 intervention studies, food labeling reduces consumer dietary intake of selected nutrients and influences industry practices to reduce product contents of sodium and artificial trans fat.

We show that the C. elegans serotonergic neuron NSM acts as an enteric sensory neuron that acutely detects food ingestion. We identify the novel and conserved acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) DEL-7 and DEL-3 as NSM-enriched channels required for feeding-dependent NSM activity, which in turn drives slow locomotion while animals feed.

Deciphering the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origins of females producing offspring with multiple sires remains a challenging problem, because a single male can usually provide enough sperm to fertilize all eggs produced by individual females. We tested the hypothesis that having multiple males sire individual clutches is adaptive for female eastern collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, by examining both the fitness costs and benefits for females of producing offspring with one versus multiple male partners. We found no support for the hypothesis that females produce offspring with multiple sires to acquire access to higher-quality food resources or refuges. However, hatching success of clutches increased with the number of males that inseminated eggs, which suggests that accepting sperm from multiple males may improve offspring hatching success through one or more mechanisms. Our results also indicate that females producing offspring with multiple male partners gained genetic advantages. Although offspring mortality from clutches sired by one versus multiple males was similar, females producing clutches sired by multiple males had more total offspring that survived to maturity, resulting in a net fitness advantage for these females. Our results suggest that producing offspring with multiple males is adaptive for female collared lizards because it promotes acquisition of several fitness benefits.  2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Here, we focus on spiders as a model group of generalist predators. They are among the most abundant and most diverse natural enemies in agroecosystems. We review their functional traits that influence food-web dynamics and pest suppression at organisational levels ranging from individuals to communities. At the individual and population levels, we focus on hunting strategy, body size, life stage, nutritional target, and personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour). These functional traits determine the spider trophic niches. We also focus on the functional and numerical response to pest densities and on non-consumptive effects of spiders on pests. At the community level, we review multiple-predator effects and effect of alternative prey on pest suppression. Evidence for a key role of spiders in pest suppression is accumulating. Importantly, recent research has highlighted widespread non-consumptive effects and complex intraguild interactions of spiders. A better understanding of these effects is needed to optimize biocontrol services by spiders in agroecosystems.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey and applying propensity score matching method and individual-level fixed effects model, this paper addresses the potential endogeneity issues that may arise between the childrens migration decisions and parental smoking behavior. Findings: This studys results indicate that rural parents left behind by their emigrant children indeed are more likely to sustain their smoking habit. The validated smoking effect of emigration calls for effective government programs that entail intervention to curb such potentially aggravating health risk, especially among middle-aged and older fathers. Originality/value: This paper is the first to examine the impact of childrens migration on the smoking behavior of left-behind parents in rural households in China. Our findings call for immediate attention to the smoking behavior of older age cohort in China as the scale of ruralurban migration trend is expected to increase. Moreover, given that many countries in Asia, such as India, Vietnam and Indonesia, are confronting similar issues, our findings could provide useful implications for smoking cessation and control policies in those countries.  2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This review takes a neurodevelopmental perspective on the very small group of males who grow up to become persistent violent offenders. After outlining six criteria for what constitutes a neurodevelopmental disorder, the extent to which chronic violence meets these definitional criteria is examined, covering the fields of genetics, structural and functional brain imaging, and neuropsychology. Early health risk factors for violence are then outlined, including birth complications, minor physical anomalies, prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure, poor nutrition, lead exposure, and traumatic brain injury. Persistent adult violence is argued to originate in aberrant temperamental behavior in early childhood, to have a stable developmental trajectory, and to be associated with impaired education, social, and occupational functioning. Taken together, it is argued that chronic adult violence meets criterion for being conceptualized as having neurodevelopmental origins and that an important, but not sole, source of neural maldevelopment lies in prenatal and early postnatal risk factors. This review concludes with a recognition of the sociopolitical context within which a neurodevelopmental perspective on chronic violence sits, together with directions for future research, including whether a neurodevelopmental hypothesis is best applied to reactive as opposed to proactive aggression.  2018 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health"

However, its prevalence is much higher in mental health and substance use treatment settings. It is associated with significant physical and psychiatric morbidity, as well as social, occupational, and legal consequences. Adult ADHD is considered to be a part of the externalizing spectrum with which it shares both homotypic comorbidity and heterotypic continuity across the lifespan. This is attributable to a shared genetic basis, which interacts with environmental risk factors such as nutritional deficiencies and psychosocial adversity to bring about epigenetic changes. This is seen to result in a lag in brain maturation particularly in the areas of the brain related to executive functioning (top-down regulation) such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortices. This delay when coupled with impairments in reward processing, leads to a preference for immediate small rewards and is common to externalizing disorders. Adult ADHD is increasingly understood to not merely be associated with the classically described symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, but also issues with motivation, emotional recognition and regulation, excessive mind wandering, and behavioral self-regulation. These symptoms are also observed in other disorders which overlap with the externalizing spectrum such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial and borderline personality disorder. It is therefore important to develop both broad-based and specific interventions to be able to target these deficits which can reduce the burden and improve outcomes.  2019 Indian Journal of Psychiatry."

Hence, the mortality and indirect effects of predation risk are dependent on the energy requirements of prey. Torpor, a controlled reduction in resting metabolism and body temperature, is a common energy-saving mechanism of small mammals that enhances their resistance to starvation. Here we test the hypothesis that torpor could also reduce predation risk by compensating for the energetic cost of antipredator behaviours. We measured the foraging behaviour and body temperature of house mice in response to manipulation of perceived predation risk by adjusting levels of ground cover and starvation risk by 24 h food withdrawal every third day. We found that a voluntary reduction in daily food intake in response to lower cover (high predation risk) was matched by the extent of a daily reduction in body temperature. Our study provides the first experimental evidence of a close link between energy-saving torpor responses to starvation risk and behavioural responses to perceived predation risk. By reducing the risk of starvation, torpor can facilitate stronger antipredator behaviours. These results highlight the interplay between the capacity for reducing metabolic energy expenditure, optimal decisions about foraging behaviour and the life-history ecology of prey.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

By examining reproductive life span, and distinguishing it from somatic life span, we gain insight into critical aspects of an individual's potential fitness as well as reproductive and somatic senescence. Additionally, differentiating somatic and reproductive life spans can provide insight into the existence of a post-reproductive period and factors that shape its duration. Given the known importance of diet and mating system on resource allocation, I reared individual freshwater snails (Physa acuta) from 22 full-sib families under a 22 factorial design that crossed mate availability (available [outcrossing] or not [selfing]) and diet (Spirulina or lettuce) and quantified aspects of the entire life history enabling me to distinguish reproductive and somatic life spans, determine the total number of reproductive events, and evaluate how the reproductive rate changes with age. Overall, mated snails experienced shorter reproductive and somatic life spans; a diet of Spirulina also shortened both reproductive and somatic life spans. A post-reproductive period existed in all conditions; its duration was proportional to somatic but not reproductive life span. I evaluate several hypotheses for the existence and duration of the post-reproductive period, including a novel hypothesis that the post-reproductive period may result from an increase in reproductive interval with age. I conclude that the post-reproductive period may be indicative of a randomly timed death occurring as the interval between reproductive events continues to increase. As such, a post-reproductive period can be viewed as a by-product of a situation where reproductive senescence outpaces somatic senescence.  2018 The Authors.

This generalist rapidly acclimatizes and adapts to a new host, hereby overcoming nutritional challenges and a novel pallet of constitutive and induced plant defenses. Although recent studies reveal that a broad transcriptomic response upon host plant transfer is associated with a generalist life style in arthropod herbivores, it remains uncertain to what extent these transcriptional changes are general stress responses or host-specific. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the transcriptomic changes that occur in a single T. urticae population upon long-term transfer from Phaseolus vulgaris to a similar, but chemically defended, host (cyanogenic Phaseolus lunatus) and to multiple economically important crops (Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays). These long-term host plant transfers were associated with distinct transcriptomic responses with only a limited overlap in both specificity and directionality, suggestive of a fine-tuned transcriptional plasticity. Nonetheless, analysis at the gene family level uncovered overlapping functional processes, recruiting genes from both well-known and newly discovered detoxification families. Of note, our analyses highlighted a possible detoxification role for Tetranychus-specific short-chain dehydrogenases and single PLAT domain proteins, and manual genome annotation showed that both families are expanded in T. urticae. Our results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable adaptive potential for host plant use of generalist arthropods and set the stage for functional validation of important players in T. urticae detoxification of plant secondary metabolites.  2018 Montesinos-Lpez et al."

Prey depletion might cause trophic niche widening in generalist species, but not in specialists, which are expected to increase their foraging effort without diet shifts. In sympatric species feeding on similar resources, reduced food availability can increase interspecific competition and cause trophic niche segregation. To understand these processes, we studied the spatio-temporal variability in diet and niche width in 2 sympatric gull species, the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis and Audouin's gull Ichthyaetus audouinii, which have experienced exponential growth in recent decades due to an increase in anthropogenic food subsidies. We sampled feathers from chicks of both species in several colonies along the western Mediterranean from 2009 to 2011 and performed stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur on these feathers. Bayesian modelling shows that both species displayed opportunistic behaviour if different types of resources were available, but could also narrow their trophic niche if 1 resource was abundant. We also provide evidence of trophic segregation between the 2 gull species, suggesting the occurrence of interspecific competition for food. Our meta-population approach provides a comprehensive view of the trophic ecology and the competitive interactions of these gull species. We emphasize the usefulness of 3-dimensional isotope analyses to correctly assess spatio-temporal variability in trophic behaviour of predator species, revealing differences that would remain hidden in single population studies or when using only the isotopic ratios of 2 elements."

In this study, we investigated repeatability in risk-taking during feeding among individuals and agonistic interactions among dyads of wild zebrafish, Danio rerio, collected from two habitats that differed in predation and flow regimes. We measured boldness as the latency to emerge from a shelter and feed in the presence of predators. We tested this for each individual from the two populations repeatedly across seven trials. We assessed aggression by subjecting size- and sex-matched pairs of fish to dyadic contests repeatedly across seven trials. Individuals from the high-predation stream population were bolder than individuals from the low-predation stagnant water population. Males were bolder than females, and in the low-predation population, larger individuals took greater risks to feed than smaller individuals. The high-predation stream population showed lower inter- and intraindividual variation in boldness than the low-predation stagnant water population. Further, both populations showed significant repeatability in risk-taking during feeding. The high-predation stream habitat fish were more aggressive than low-predation stagnant-water fish. Male dyads from the low-predation stagnant-water population were significantly more aggressive than female dyads. Most fish from the low-predation stagnant water population did not show aggressive behavior, resulting in low between-dyad but high within-dyad variation in aggression. The difference in behavioral responses between the populations and consistency in these traits within individuals is discussed in the light of confounding role of ecological and state-dependent factors.  2018 American Psychological Association."

If individuals optimize their FID, this distance should reflect the point at which the fitness resulting from leaving exceeds the fitness resulting from all other possible decisions. Previous theory of FID has often been aimed at explaining this behavior in foraging individuals. Yet flight initiation in response to approaching threats occurs in a range of contexts that might influence optimal behavior. In breeding individuals, risk-taking decisions that are made at a location of offspring care (e.g., a nest or den) can have significant effects on fitness. Here, we develop a theoretical model of distances at which a parent bird flushes from a nest in response to an approaching threat. We estimate parent fitness with regards to characteristics of the parent (reproductive values, detection distance, and cost of lost parental care cost), the nest (concealment and accessibility), and the approaching predator (detection capability and predation success), developing a dichotomous scenario between staying at the nest or leaving at varying distances. Using a generalized comparison of the benefits of leaving versus staying, we find that increasing costs of lost parental care, probability of predation of the parent due to fleeing, or current reproductive value lead to more instances of staying at the nest. In a complementary approach with specified parameters based on biologically-informed factors that likely influence a predator-prey encounter, we find that increasing the current reproductive value, concealment of the nest, or costs of lost parental care decrease optimal FID and can lead to the parent staying at the nest. Other factors, such as increasing residual reproductive value, predation success, and predator capability of detecting the nest, increase optimal FID with some instances of costs of fleeing being so great that staying becomes an optimal strategy. Our theory provides a framework to explain variation in FID among nesting species and individuals and could provide a foundation for future empirical investigations of risk-taking behavior.  2018 Dowling, Bonier.

However, there are numerous reasons why an animal may not control ingestion, at least precisely.

In a series of experiments, we have studied the behavioural responses of goldfish (prey) and little egrets (predator) when brought together in a large laboratory apparatus  an aviary with three pools of water. To obtain a baseline, we measured their behaviour in an aviary without manipulating any variable (Katz et al., 2010). Because the results of that study suggested that both fish and egrets follow the rules of optimal foraging, we undertook a series of experiments in which we manipulated the number of food patches (Katz et al., 2014a), the number of fish per pool (Katz et al., 2014b; Vijayan et al., 2018a), and the size of goldfish refuges (Vijayan et al., 2018b). In each case, the results supported the hypothesis of optimal behaviour. Mitchell (2018, this issue) makes four predictions about the behaviours of both species as the abundance of fish resources changes in a system such as the aviary. Specifically: (1) Prey should respond very weakly, if at all, to variation in the food ration among patches. (2) The predator should allocate more time to patches with a higher prey-food ration. (3) When moving to another patch, the predator should choose the patch with the higher prey-food ration more often than it would at random. (4) The predator will kill more prey in patches receiving a larger ration of prey-food. Aims: Explore the effect of varying the abundance of fish-food on the behaviours of goldfish and little egrets in the aviary. Determine whether variation in their behaviours agrees with the predictions of Mitchells theoretical model. Methods: We used little egrets (the predators) and goldfish (the prey). We conducted experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter). Each aviary contained three separate patches, i.e. three pools (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, 1000 litres), each open to foraging by a single egret in the aviary. A fixed cover (22.75 cm radius) at the centre of each pool provided a refuge for the goldfish. Each pool had 15 fish. We manipulated intraspecific competition by offering three different amounts of goldfish food in an aviary each day: full (1.13 g per day), half (0.56 g per day), and quarter (0.28 g per day) rations. We then observed and recorded the behaviours of both players for 6 hours. Results: Patch-to-patch variation in the food ration had no effect on fish activity. But the egret allocated more time to foraging in the patch where the prey-food ration was highest (1.13 g). When moving to another patch, the egret moved to the patches containing high food rations (1.13 and 0.56 g) rather than the patch with the lowest food ration (0.28 g). And the predator caught significantly fewer goldfish in these poorest patches. Thus all four predictions were validated.  2018 Zvika Abramsky."

Objectives: To determine whether treatment-seeking children and adolescents with obesity cluster into phenotypes based on known eating behaviours and appetitive traits (eating correlates) and how socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associate with different phenotypes. Methods: A cross-sectional, multi-centre questionnaire was administered between November 2015 and March 2017 examining correlates of eating in children and adolescents attending weight-management programmes in Canada. Latent profile analysis was used to cluster participants based on seven eating correlate scores obtained from questionnaires. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine phenotype differences on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models assessed relative risk of specific characteristics associating with a disordered eating phenotype. Results: Participants were 247 children and adolescents (45.3% male, mean BMI z-score = 3.4  1.0 kg/m2) from six paediatric weight management centres in Canada. Seven eating correlates clustered into three distinct phenotypes: (1) loss of control eating, emotional eating, external eating, hyperphagia, impulsivity (Mixed-Severe; n = 42, 17%), (2) loss of control eating, emotional eating, external eating, hyperphagia (Mixed-Moderate; n = 138, 55.9%), and (3) impulsivity (Impulsive; n = 67; 27.1%). Social functioning scores and body esteem were significantly different across groups, with the Mixed-Severe participants having the poorest social functioning and lowest body esteem. Low body esteem indicated a greater risk of being in a multi-correlate group compared to the Impulsive group, while poor social function had a greater risk of clustering in the Mixed-Severe than Impulsive phenotype. Conclusions: Distinct eating phenotypes were found in treatment-seeking children and adolescents with obesity. Empirical evidence is needed, but these data suggest that tailored treatment approaches could be informed by these classifications to improve weight-management outcomes.  2018, Springer Nature Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The research method in this study was the descriptive type and was based on the goal of the applied research methods. Data were collected from 384 sample group consumers of chain stores in the city of Tehran. The hypothesized relationships were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: Final results of study showed the significant effects of FRL and FRPT on satisfaction and loyalty of consumers. This indicates that aforementioned variables can create customer satisfaction and loyalty toward food. The research conceptual model was confirmed with goodness of fit. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample consisted of customers who use a wide range of food despite diverse motives and interests. While knowing that costumers specific traits about food would have provided a more detailed and comprehensive understanding, conducting research in a set of general food consumer without considering special foods category could be a limitation. Second, and more importantly, since the customer behavior in consumption choices is an unconscious and cognitive process, other factors and domain that are linked to customer satisfaction and loyalty would have been missed. Practical implications: This study shows that understanding the behavioral aspects of food consumption can help food producing companies to adjust their production and specially to foresee changes. Marketers are advised to investigate customer traits to promote customer satisfaction and loyalty effectively. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge in food marketing. Originality/value: The present study offers a unique and valuable insight into a customers behavior and deepens customer satisfaction and loyalty by incorporating FRL, food neophobia scale and food involvement scale as independent variables to contribute knowledge in the context of food marketing, and throws some light upon the predictive power of mentioned variables on customer behaviors.  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Methods: An online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess US-based cat owners experience with behavior problems of their cats, familiarity with psychoactive medications for treatment of behavior problems and comfort levels using the following products for treatment of feline behavior problems: fast-acting or situational prescription medications, slow-acting or long-term prescription medications, herbal/nutritional supplements, pheromone products and cannabinoid products. Results: Many respondents reported that their cats had behavioral problems, but few had ever sought behavioral help for their cats. Only half were aware of the availability of psychoactive medications for cat behavior problems. Respondents who had personally used a prescription psychoactive medication in the past were more comfortable with giving fast- and slow-acting prescription medications, pheromone products and cannabinoids to their cats than respondents who had never used a prescription psychoactive medication. No difference in comfort level was seen for herbal/nutritional supplements. Overall, owners tended to be more comfortable with the situational vs. long-term medications. Conclusions and relevance: Given the prevalence of feline behavior problems reported in this study, the lack of awareness of either the availability or potential benefits of psychoactive medications for the treatment of feline behavior problems, and the fact that very few owners had ever sought help for behavior problems with their cats, are concerning. These results suggest a missed opportunity for veterinarians to help clients identify, understand and treat feline behavior problems. Many owners appear open to these treatment options for their cats; it is suggested that, when warranted, educating cat owners about the potential benefits and risks of these medications would be of value.

There are mainly two kinds of predation patterns for conifer seed predators, that is, pre-dispersal predation and post-dispersal predation. The process of animal prey on seeds is an important way for the regeneration of tree species. Seeds that evade predators form corresponding defensive strategies, with seed size, nutrition, fiber content, secondary metabolites and so on being generally strategies for seed protection against predators. These defensive strategies will affect the seed predators population dynamics and feeding behavior, and may also lead the seed predator to adapt to the seed defense. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the predation mode of seed predator on seeds of conifers in order to better understand the animal feeding behavior in coniferous forest. Meanwhile, studying the conifer seed defense and seed predators adaptive strategy will help understand the relationship between plants and animals.  2018, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

To this end, the IACUC must integrate the information provided by the investigators of each preclinical study and the veterinarians from the animal facility in order to monitor and approve the process. Using a paper-based system to collect animal health and welfare data is a common, albeit time-consuming practice, prone to transcription and reading errors, not to mention inconvenient for veterinarians and investigators wishing to make timely and collaborative decisions when animal welfare is at risk. We created a web-based monitoring system focused on animal health with the potential to improve animal welfare. The data management system is based on REDCap software, which enables data integration in order to offer a solution for animal welfare assessment. The proposed scheme includes key indicators of general health status, such as environment, physical/nutritional information, and behavioral parameters during animal breeding and experimentation, as important components of animal welfare. In addition, the system facilitates communication of this information among researchers, animal facility staff, and the IACUC. REDCap is available to non-profit organizations, and may be adapted and replicated by institutions interested in and responsible for animal care, and used in research. REDCap is an excellent tool for promoting good practices that benefit experimental animal health.  The Author(s) 2018."

ELS in humans is associated with increased risk for developmental psychopathology, including anxious and depressive phenotypes. The biological mechanisms underlying these potentially persistent maladaptive changes involve long-term epigenetic modifications, which have been suggested to be potentially transmissible to subsequent generations. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that modifies gene expression patterns in response to environmental challenges and influences mutation rates. It remains to be seen whether a functionally relevant fraction of DNA methylation marks can escape genome-wide erasures that occur in primordial germ cells and after fertilization within the zygote. Early life-stress-triggered changes in epigenetic mediated transmission of acquired behavioral traits among humans have been assessed mainly by targeting genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, such as NR3C1 and FKBP5. Recently, researchers examining epigenetic transmission have begun to apply genome-wide approaches. In humans, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on peripheral samples that were obtained from individuals who were prenatally exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter, resulting in two Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) in INSR and CPTIA genes that were functionally, biologically and technically validated, and significantly associated with birth weights and LDL cholesterol levels in offspring. In rodents, non-genomic intergenerational transmission of anxiety which was associated with differentially methylated enhancers that were putatively involved in lipid signaling and synaptic/neurotransmission in hippocampal granule cells, was discovered also using RRBS. Finally, transgenerational transmission of altered behaviors was associated with sperm-derived microRNAs produced by ELS male mice. The field of epigenetic transmission is just beginning to enter the epigenomic era by using genome-wide analyses. Such approaches remain of strong interest to human studies, first in order to help to assess the relevance of the previous targeted studies, and second to discover new important epigenetic modifications of potential clinical importance. New discoveries may help to assess how transmittable the negative impact of stress may be to offspring. The latter may open doors for future treatments and resilience-promoting interventions, as well as new approaches to treat the effects of childhood trauma before the onset of psychiatric disorder.  2018 Bentham Science Publishers."

Melanoma patients were more likely to practice sun-protective behaviors after their diagnosis. But it is not known how long these sun-protective behaviors will sustain. We aim to evaluate if sun-protective behaviors and likelihood of recent sunburn differ according to time elapsed since the melanoma diagnosis using the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Data in the NHANES cycle years 2003-2006 and 2010-2012 were analyzed. The relationship of sun-protective behaviors and likelihood of sunburns with the time since a melanoma diagnosis was evaluated and also adjusted for possible confounding factors such as age, gender, and skin reaction to the sun. A total of 34 participants with previous melanoma provided responses to their current sun-protective behaviors and recent occurrence of sunburns. The control group consisted of 13,871 participants who never had any diagnoses of malignancies. The control and the non-recent diagnosis groups were more likely to have sunburns but less likely to engage in consistent sun-protective behaviors compared to the recent diagnosis group. A multivariate regression model showed a 1.17 increased odds of having a recent sunburn for each additional year elapsed since a melanoma diagnosis ( p = 0.046). In our study, those with a melanoma diagnosis in the non-recent past were more likely to have sunburns and less likely to sun protect. More can definitely be done to educate and cultivate sun-protective behaviors among the U.S. population."

Remarkably, the study of human microbiome provided a new perspective on a myriad of human traits previously regarded as solely (epi-) genetically encoded, such as disease susceptibility, immunological response, and social and nutritional behaviors. In this context, metagenomics has established a powerful framework for understanding the intricate connections between human societies and microbial communities, ultimately allowing for the optimization of both human health and productivity. Thus, we have shifted from the old concept of microbes as harmful organisms to a broader panorama, in which the signal of the relationship between humans and microbes is flexible and directly dependent on our own decisions and practices. In parallel, metagenomics has also been playing a major role in the prospection of ""hidden"" genetic features and the development of biotechnological applications, through the discovery of novel genes, enzymes, pathways, and bioactive molecules with completely new or improved biochemical functions.

However, when faced with starvation, organisms may accept risks to enhance future reproductive opportunities. We investigated the effect of starvation on risk-taking behaviour in the common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris Linnaeus, 1758). Lumbricus terrestris are negatively phototactic annelids that feed on decaying plant matter at the soil surface. Feeding in high-light conditions is a potentially riskier choice, given the threats of visual predators and desiccation. We predicted that starvation in L. terrestris would increase risk-taking behaviour and decrease time taken (latency) to make choices. We manipulated the starvation level of L. terrestris individuals (nonstarved, half-starved, and fully starved) and presented them with a binary foraging choice. Lumbricus terrestris could choose either a low-food and dark condition (low-risk condition) or a high-food and light condition (high-risk condition). We found that starved individuals selected the high-risk condition more often than nonstarved individuals. Starved individuals also had a decreased latency to first choice. Risk-taking did not scale with level of starvation; there was no difference in foraging choice and latency between half-and fully starved individuals. Our results indicate that L. terrestris makes state-dependent foraging choices, providing insight into the importance of fundamental life-history trade-offs in this understudied species.  2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

A change in disease phenotype and behaviour has been observed recently. Objective To review the changing profile of CP in India and examine its relationship with environmental influences and socio-economic development. Methods Relevant studies on CP in India were reviewed along with social and economic parameters in Kerala over the past 4 decades. Results There has been a definite change in the phenotype of CP in India with onset in mid twenties, better nutritional status, and a much better prognosis compared with the reports in 1970s. Genetic susceptibility due to genetic mutations particularly in SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC, and CLDN2/MORC4 genes is the most important factor and not malnutrition or dietary toxins for idiopathic CP suggesting the term 'tropical pancreatitis' is a misnomer. We observed a close relationship between socio-economic development and rising income in Kerala with late onset of disease, nutritional status, and better prognosis of CP. Conclusion Changing profile of CP in India and better understanding of risk factors provide evidence for gene-environmental interactions in its pathobiology.  The Author(s) 2016."

Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to determine the relationship between sedentary behaviour and health indicators in school-aged children and youth aged 5-17 years. Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO), personal libraries and government documents were searched for relevant studies examining time spent engaging in sedentary behaviours and six specific health indicators (body composition, fitness, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, self-esteem, pro-social behaviour and academic achievement). 232 studies including 983,840 participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Television (TV) watching was the most common measure of sedentary behaviour and body composition was the most common outcome measure. Qualitative analysis of all studies revealed a dose-response relation between increased sedentary behaviour and unfavourable health outcomes. Watching TV for more than 2 hours per day was associated with unfavourable body composition, decreased fitness, lowered scores for self-esteem and pro-social behaviour and decreased academic achievement. Meta-analysis was completed for randomized controlled studies that aimed to reduce sedentary time and reported change in body mass index (BMI) as their primary outcome. In this regard, a meta-analysis revealed an overall significant effect of -0.81 (95\% CI of -1.44 to -0.17, p = 0.01) indicating an overall decrease in mean BMI associated with the interventions. There is a large body of evidence from all study designs which suggests that decreasing any type of sedentary time is associated with lower health risk in youth aged 5-17 years. In particular, the evidence suggests that daily TV viewing in excess of 2 hours is associated with reduced physical and psychosocial health, and that lowering sedentary time leads to reductions in BMI."

Limited dispersion of trichomes in reaction to Pseudomicrothorax dubius separated from cyanobacterium with a mesh insert indicates the existence of a chemical cue originating from the ciliates. Grazers released into the wells where trichomes' dispersion was already limited by the cue initially had no difficulty finding food, but started to starve 24h later. Similar situation was observed in control wells. Direct observations of trichomes attacked by the ciliates showed a distinct difference between the trichomes previously subjected to mesh-separated ciliate and the control ones. The former withdrew more frequently into a rigid sheath, whereas the latter usually withdrew into elastic tubes. This suggests that both chemical and mechanical stimuli are necessary to express cyanobacterium defence to the fullest extent. Further investigations showed that ciliates specialised in ingesting filamentous Cyanobacteria limit trichomes' dispersion, whereas filter-feeding Euplotes and Cyanobacteria-feeding rotifer do not. The cyanobacterium can detect grazer presence even without direct contact and modify its morphology in a way enabling full expression of defence reaction. This is the first report on ciliate-cyanobacterium chemical mediation."

Such anthropogenic areas have specific environmental characteristics, which influence the physiology, life history, and population dynamics of plants and animals. For example, the date of bud burst is advanced in urban compared to nearby natural areas. In some birds, breeding success is determined by synchrony between timing of breeding and peak food abundance. Pertinently, caterpillars are an important food source for the nestlings of many bird species, and their abundance is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and date of bud burst. Higher temperatures and advanced date of bud burst in urban areas could advance peak caterpillar abundance and thus affect breeding phenology of birds. In order to test whether laying date advance and clutch sizes decrease with the intensity of urbanization, we analyzed the timing of breeding and clutch size in relation to intensity of urbanization as a measure of human impact in 199 nest box plots across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East (i.e., the Western Palearctic) for four species of hole-nesters: blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tits (Parus major), collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Meanwhile, we estimated the intensity of urbanization as the density of buildings surrounding study plots measured on orthophotographs. For the four study species, the intensity of urbanization was not correlated with laying date. Clutch size in blue and great tits does not seem affected by the intensity of urbanization, while in collared and pied flycatchers it decreased with increasing intensity of urbanization. This is the first large-scale study showing a species-specific major correlation between intensity of urbanization and the ecology of breeding. The underlying mechanisms for the relationships between life history and urbanization remain to be determined. We propose that effects of food abundance or quality, temperature, noise, pollution, or disturbance by humans may on their own or in combination affect laying date and/or clutch size."

Females and males live in an environment full of smells, whose molecules communicate to them the availability of food, potential mates, competitors or predators. Volatile chemicals derived from fruit, yeast growing on the fruit, and flies already present on the fruit attract Drosophila, concentrating flies at food sites, where they will also mate. Species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons displayed on female Drosophila as they mature are sensed by males and act as pheromones to stimulate mating by conspecific males and inhibit heterospecific mating. The pheromonal profile of a female is also responsive to her nutritional environment, providing an honest signal of her fertility potential. After mating, cuticular and semen hydrocarbons transferred by the male change the female's chemical profile. These molecules make the female less attractive to other males, thus protecting her mate's sperm investment. Females have evolved the capacity to counteract this inhibition by ejecting the semen hydrocarbon (along with the rest of the remaining ejaculate) a few hours after mating. Although this ejection can temporarily restore the female's attractiveness, shortly thereafter another male pheromone, a seminal peptide, decreases the female's propensity to re-mate, thus continuing to protect the male's investment. Females use olfaction and taste sensing to select optimal egg-laying sites, integrating cues for the availability of food for her offspring, and the presence of other flies and of harmful species. We argue that taking into account evolutionary considerations such as sexual conflict, and the ecological conditions in which flies live, is helpful in understanding the role of highly species-specific pheromones and blends thereof, as well as an individual's response to the chemical cues in its environment."

For sympatric species, convergence of head morphology can indicate similar prey or foraging strategies while divergence can suggest competition, resource partitioning or expansion into new habitats. Sexual dimorphism can further complicate the head morphology-diet relationship by potentially reducing intraspecific competition. To understand the relationship between head morphology and diet, we studied three sympatric species, the plain-bellied (Nerodia erythrogaster), diamondback (N. rhombifer), and northern (N. sipedon) watersnakes in western Kentucky. All three species inhabit similar wetlands and feed on amphibians and fishes. The anurophagous plain-bellied watersnakes had longer, narrower heads that likely allow snakes to capture anuran metamorphs and froglets while facilitating movement through dense vegetation. The piscivorous diamondback watersnake had a wider head, which would enhance contact with prey in this open-mouth forager, and smaller interocular distance, resulting in dorsally placed eyes that facilitate seeing fish prey from below. The mostly piscivorous northern watersnake had an intermediate, generalized head shape, which may reflect the typically wide diet range of this species. Head shape did not differ between snake sexes but diamondback and northern females had larger heads than males and fed more frequently on fishes. The relationship between head morphology and diet highlights potential interspecific and intersexual competition and aids in the understanding of species coexistence patterns."

New developments in sensor technology have the potential to replace former costly data collection systems. Furthermore, phenotypes on new traits can be collected cost-efficiently on large amounts of animals and used for genetic improvement of these traits that could not be addressed so far. Examples are body condition, feed intake, feed conversion, and many behaviour traits. First analyses show that data from many on-farm sensors are not yet as accurate as data from laboratory analyses, but technological progress of data calibration is expected. Together with the high amount of repeated measures, heritabilities might increase."

However, information processing is rarely cost-free, and thus cognitive adaptations are expected to be fined-tuned to prevailing ecological and social conditions. Models and laboratory experiments underline the importance of environmental variability in determining the value of information; however, we still know very little on the link between environmental variability and cognitive abilities in wild populations. Here we outline a series of studies in which we assessed information use and learning in conspecifics living along two ecological gradients that impact variability of the food supply: elevation and urbanization. While low- and high-elevation great tits, Parus major, were found to differ in accuracy in a reversal learning task, the difference was in the direction opposite to our prediction, with low-elevation birds outperforming their high-elevation counterparts. Furthermore, we found no relationship between urbanization and spatial memory accuracy in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, despite urban habitats being known to harbour more stable food supplies during the winter and, thus, potentially providing lower incentive to invest in food hoarding and spatial memory. However, as predicted, chickadees in urban habitats explored a new environment faster and seemed to rely less heavily on social information about novel food patches compared to forest chickadees. Our results point to the need to better link predictive models with experienced fluctuations in food availability for individual foragers and to take into account social as well as ecological variables that can impact the value of information and may covary along natural gradients of harshness.

The purpose of this overview of systematic reviews was to examine the characteristics and dietary behaviour change outcomes of nutrition interventions among populations with or at risk of non-communicable chronic diseases. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing dietary behaviour change interventions published between January 2006 and November 2015 were identified via searches in Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Quality of reviews were appraised using AMSTAR. Dietary behaviour change and intervention details were extracted and systematically summarised. Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Dietary behaviour changes in response to nutrition interventions were significant in over half of interventions. Reducing dietary fat and increasing fruits and vegetables were the most common behaviour changes. The characteristics of nutrition interventions and their relationship to effectiveness for dietary behaviour change among chronic disease or at-risk populations were reported inconsistently. However, associative evidence exists to support more frequent contacts and the use of specific behaviour change techniques. No clear relationships were found between effectiveness and intervention setting, mode of delivery or intervention provider, although some population-specific relationships were identified. Interventions that promote long-term maintenance of dietary behaviour changes are lacking in the literature. This comprehensive umbrella review identifies specific characteristics of interventions that are associated with effectiveness in interventions that promote dietary behaviour change among different at-risk populations. In order to maximise outcomes, public health, health promotion and healthcare organisations should consider these results in order to inform the development and improvement of nutrition programmes."

Over several decades, it has been shown that allometric scaling of biological rates and feeding interactions provide stability to complex food web models. Moreover, introducing adaptive responses of organisms to environmental changes (e.g. like adaptive foraging that enables organisms to adapt their diets depending on resources abundance) improved species persistence in food webs. Here, we introduce the concept of metabolic adjustment, i.e. the ability of species to slow down their metabolic rates when facing starvation and to increase it in time of plenty. We study the reactions of such a model to nutrient enrichment and the adjustment speed of metabolic rates. We found that increasing nutrient enrichment leads to a paradox of enrichment (increase in biomasses and oscillation amplitudes and ultimately extinction of species) but metabolic adjustment stabilises the system by dampening the oscillations. Metabolic adjustment also increases the average biomass of the top predator in a tri-trophic food chain. In complex food webs, metabolic adjustment has a stabilising effect as it promotes species survival by creating a large diversity of metabolic rates. However, this stabilising effect is mitigated in enriched ecosystems. Phenotypic plasticity of organisms must be considered in food web models to better understand the response of organisms to their environment. As metabolic rate is central in describing biological rates, we must pay attention to its variations to fully understand the population dynamics of natural communities."

Research in this area follows a broad range of concrete partial manifestations of health behavior. Is it necessary to differentiate between various types of health behavior or could these partial manifestations be combined under one common scale? Methods: Data acquisition tool: Health-Related Behavior Scale (HRBS, 42 items). Data processing methods: principal component analysis (the internal structure of HRBS), confirmatory factor analysis (the latent factor structure of four tested models). Sample: N=1,664 adult respondents. Results: The HRBS described ten areas of health-related behavior (ten extracted factors). All tested models of latent structure showed almost identical mathematical and statistical values of the model. Conclusion: Health-related behavior includes a set of partial behaviors (behavior related to nutrition, addictive substances, movement, and physical exercises). An unambiguous latent factor structure has not been revealed. An open question remains whether there is one latent factor behind all health-related behaviors or whether there are multiple latent factors. The use of one or the other model should be deduced from the underlying theory and research objectives. To find a reliable model of health behavior, it is necessary to include moderators and mediators such as personality, attitude, or economic status."

This is presumably in response to the novel pressures to which an invader is exposed, but the proximate basis for those changes remains unclear. Phenotypic changes may be generated by environmental factors (E), genetic factors (G) or the interaction between these two processes (GxE). To explore this issue, we obtained eight clutches of the cane toad (Rhinella marina) from three regions across its range of invasion within Australia, and raised the offspring under standard conditions (diet and/or exercise level manipulations) to clarify the proximate underpinnings of geographical divergence in phenotypic traits. Our results demonstrate that phenotypic variation among Australian cane toad populations is affected by genetics and environment, and an interaction between these two processes. Some traits (e.g. sprint distance) differed among populations, suggesting a heritable basis. Other traits (e.g. relative heart mass) were affected by experimental treatments but not by population. Intriguingly, other traits (e.g. body length) were affected by interactions between population of origin and experimental treatments. The relative importance of G, E and G x E differs among traits, but all three mechanisms have contributed to the rapid phenotypic divergence observed across the Australian range of invasive cane toads."

For example, habitat degradation at renewable energy production sites may affect the persistence of wildlife populations. We assessed the effects of wind farms in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area near Palm Springs, California, 2013-2015, on local populations of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). The side-blotched lizard is a common and ubiquitous desert reptile that is a major consumer of invertebrates and, in turn, represents a key prey base for many avian, reptilian, and mammalian predators. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to compare a comprehensive set of population-level vital signs (i.e., abundance, population growth rate, survival, recruitment, body condition, age structure, activity area size, movement rates) among populations at 4 wind farms and at 5 reference areas. Although our models indicate that wind facilities have a weak negative effect on side-blotched lizard survival, our overall results suggest that wind farms do not substantially influence the demography or behavior of these small lizards. Population response to general anthropogenic disturbance (quantified as an index of road type and density) was more pronounced, with lower population growth rates, adult-skewed age structure, and reduced body condition at highly disturbed wind farm and reference sites. We therefore conclude that wind-power facilities can support healthy populations of side-blotched lizards, indicating that wind energy development is compatible with a native Mojave Desert species. However, our results show that anthropogenic disturbance, as measured by the type and density of roadways, has a negative effect on lizard populations, and should be carefully planned whether associated with energy development or not. Our study demonstrates a methodological approach that can be applied to other species, including those with lower tolerances to disturbance, to measure their response to renewable energy development.

For example, duty cycle (the proportion of time filled by vocalizations) and fine structure traits (e.g., number of D notes) can encode contextual factors, such as predator size and food quality. Wilson and Mennill (2011) found that chickadees show stronger behavioral responses to playback of chick-a-dee calls with higher duty cycles, but not to the number of D notes. That is, independent of the number of D notes in a call, but dependent on the overall proportion of time filled with vocalization, birds responded more to higher duty cycle playback compared to lower duty cycle playback. Here we presented chickadees with chick-a-dee calls that contained either two D (referred to hereafter as 2 D) notes with a low duty cycle, 2 D notes with a high duty cycle, 10 D notes with a high duty cycle, or 2 D notes with a high duty cycle but played in reverse (a non-signaling control). We then measured ZENK expression in the auditory nuclei where perceptual discrimination is thought to occur. Based on the behavioral results of Wilson and Mennill, 2011, we predicted we would observe the highest ZENK expression in response to forward-playing calls with high duty cycles; we predicted we would observe no significant difference in ZENK expression between forward-playing high duty cycle playbacks (2 D or 10 D). We found no significant difference between forward-playing 2 D and 10 D high duty cycle playbacks. However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find any effects of altering the duty cycle or note number presented."

We focus primarily on evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity, which is a type of phenotypic plasticity, resulting in life-history changes as ways of dealing with fluctuations in food resource availability. Using EcoSim, a predator-prey individual-based model, we compare individuals with stable food resources with those in environments where there are fluctuating food resources in terms of adaptation through behavioral plasticity and evolution. The purpose of our study is to determine whether evolution and behavioral plasticity truly play a role in adapting to an environment with fluctuating food resources, as well as to determine whether there are specific gene divergences between gene pools in fluctuating. food resource environments versus gene pools where food resources are relatively stable. An important result of our study is that individuals in environments that are unstable with respect to food resource availability exhibited significant differences in behaviors versus those in environments with stable food resources. Although behavioral plasticity facilitates a rapid response to unstable food conditions, our study revealed the evolution of perceptual traits such as vision range in reaction to fluctuating food resources, indicating the importance of evolution in adapting to unstable resource environments in the long run. Moreover, using decision trees, we found that there were significant behavioral gene divergences between individuals in environments with fluctuating food resources as opposed to individuals in environments with stable food resources.

To elucidate the possible effects of temperature and food concentrations on acclimation capacity, physiological responses of the mussel, Perna viridis, were measured after individuals were held for six weeks under varying temperatures and food availability. Warm-acclimated mussels experiencing higher food levels had significantly greater upper thermal limits than those maintained on lower food levels. In contrast, the upper thermal limits of cold-acclimated mussels were not affected by food levels. For warm-acclimated mussels, differences in upper thermal limits were likely due to rapid depletion of energy storage as predicted by Dynamic Energy Budget model simulations for P. viridis exposed to lower food levels. Clearance rates of cold-acclimated mussels were significantly lower than warm-acclimated mussels, regardless of food availability. The impacts of lower food acquisition on energy storage, however, could be compensated by lower metabolic rates of the cold-acclimated mussels. The availability and the ability to acquire food are not, therefore, the main drivers differentiating between the upper thermal tolerances of cold- and warm-acclimated mussels, but these differences are driven by the past thermal history the mussels experienced. The temperature tolerance range of P. viridis showed a positive shift to tolerate higher temperatures after acclimation. Such flexibility in thermal tolerance implies P. viridis has high capacity to acclimate to novel environments, which will enhance its future success given its commercial importance as an aquaculture species."

The nested nature of circadian and seasonal behavior complicates tests for effects of rarer disturbance events like fire. Fire can dramatically alter plant community structure, with important knock-on effects at higher trophic levels, but the strength and timing of fire's effects on herbivores remain unclear. We combined prescribed fire treatments with fine-scale location data to quantify herbivore responses to fire across three temporal scales. Between 2001 and 2003, 26 stands of fir (Abies spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were thinned and burned; 27 similar stands were left untreated as experimental controls. Analyzing female elk (Cervus canadensis) locations across 21 yr (1996-2016), we found crepuscular, seasonal, and successional shifts in behavioral responses to fire. Elk displayed ``commuting{''} behavior, avoiding burns during the day, but selecting them at night. Elk selection for burns was strongest in early summer and the relative probability of elk using burns peaked quickly (5 yr post burn) before gradually returning to pre-treatment levels (15 yr post burn). Our results demonstrate that fire history has complex, persistent effects on herbivore behavior, and suggest that herbivores benefit from heterogeneous landscapes containing a range of successional stages."

A.","JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE","0022-0302","101","","11310-11320","2018","","10.3168/jds.2018-15151","The aim of this study was is to determine if estrous expression, as measured by an automated activity monitor (AAM), affects timing and failure of ovulation of lactating Holstein dairy cows. Cows were equipped with 2 AAM, 1 neck-mounted (AAM(c) ) and 1 leg-mounted (AAM(L)), by 10 d postpartum and enrolled into the trial when their activity crossed the alert threshold on the AAM(c). A total of 850 episodes of estrus from 293 different cows were used for this study. When cows were enrolled, their ovaries were scanned by transrectal ultrasonography and gait and body condition scored. Ovaries of cows detected in estrus were scanned twice daily for a maximum of 3 d to determine the disappearance of the preovulatory follicle (ovulation) and the interval from estrus to ovulation was calculated. Physical activity data recorded from the AAM were used to determine estrus behavior using 2 traits: (1) peak activity and (2) duration. Peak activity was only available for the AAM(L). Peak activity was defined as the maximum activity during an estrus episode. Duration of estrus was defined as the time the activity of the cow exceeded threshold values set by the AAM software. The AAM(c) correctly identified 87.8\% of the estrus alerts, with 12.2\% false positives. The average (+/- standard deviation) intervals from activity alert to ovulation were 25.8 +/- 10.2 and 24.7 +/- 9.3 h for the AAM(c) and AAM(L), respectively. Changes in estrous expression were associated with differences in the interval from alert to ovulation. Cows with short intervals to ovulation were found to have less intense estrous expression than cows with medium and long length intervals to ovulation using the AAM(c), whereas using the AAM(L), cows with short intervals to ovulation exhibited less intense estrous expression than cows with medium but the same as those with long intervals to ovulation. Furthermore, irrespective of the AAM, estrus events with less estrous expression had increased odds of having a short interval to ovulation (below the median of 20 h) when compared with those having greater estrous expression (2.6 and 1.9 increased odds for the AAM(c) and AAM(L), respectively). Ovulation failure was affected by estrous expression because estrus events with greater peak activity or longer duration had reduced ovulation failure compared with those with less estrous expression (AAM(c) peak activity: 1.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 9.5 +/- 1.7\%; AAM(L) peak activity: 2.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.5\%; AAM(c) duration: 2.1 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.9 +/- 1.7\%). In addition, cows with more estrous expression had greater pregnancy per artificial insemination than those with less estrous expression with both the AAM(c) (42.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 31.7 +/- 0.4\%) and the AAM(L) (43.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 36.3 +/- 0.4\%). Pregnancy per artificial insemination results were consistent even when removing cows that failed to ovulate. In conclusion, expression of estrus was highly associated with ovulation timing, ovulation failure, and fertility when using 2 different AAM. Cows with greater estrous expression have longer intervals from activity alert to ovulation, experience less ovulation failure, and have greater pregnancy per artificial insemination."

However, what happens when animals fail to get a reward is largely unknown, although this is commonly seen in behaviors such as predation. Here, we set up a behavioral model of repeated failure in reward pursuit (RFRP) in Drosophila larvae. In this model, the larvae were repeatedly prevented from reaching attractants such as yeast and butyl acetate, before finally abandoning further attempts. After giving up, they usually showed a decreased locomotor speed and impaired performance in light avoidance and sugar preference, which were named as phenotypes of RFRP states. In larvae that had developed RFRP phenotypes, the octopamine concentration was greatly elevated, while th mutants devoid of octopamine were less likely to develop RFRP phenotypes, and octopamine feeding efficiently restored such defects. By down-regulating th in different groups of neurons and imaging neuronal activity, neurons that regulated the development of RFRP states and the behavioral exhibition of RFRP phenotypes were mapped to a small subgroup of non-glutamatergic and glutamatergic octopaminergic neurons in the central larval brain. Our results establish a model for investigating the effect of depriving an expected reward in Drosophila and provide a simplified framework for the associated neural basis."

Animals often alter their foraging behaviour in response to a predatory threat by increasing or decreasing food consumption or by changing their feeding preferences to focus on foods that limit their exposure to the threat. Changes in grazing pressure and diet selectivity can have significant impacts on the abundance and diversity of the prey's food resources. In this study, we examined the indirect effects of a predatory fish on macrophyte biomass, mediated by crayfish responses to predator odours. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Centrarchidae) were housed in flow-through stream mesocosms to produce odour cues that initiated a nonconsumptive effect on rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus, Cambaridae) held in an adjacent section of the stream. Crayfish were offered three species of macrophytes (Myriophyllum exalbescens, Haloragaceae; Elodea canadensis, Hydrocharitaceae; Chara spp., Characeae) and were allowed to graze for 48 hr. Consumption of each plant species was measured by weighing the plant samples before and after every trial. The plant samples were further analysed for total phenolic content using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Foraging and shelter use behaviours were quantified by analysis of video recordings for time spent foraging in the mesocosm and time spent in the shelter zone of the mesocosm. Crayfish consumed greater quantities of macrophyte tissue when predator cues were present, and this result was unexpected and is contrary to most observations in the literature. When threatened, the crayfish also showed a preference for two of the macrophyte species, which did not exist in trials without bass odour. This could be due to differences in total phenolic content among the three plant species tested. The results provide evidence for a strong indirect effect of predatory fish on the macrophyte community mediated by changes in crayfish behaviour under threat. Crayfish act as keystone species in stream ecosystems; thus, changes in their foraging behaviour and dietary preferences caused by exposure to predator odour cues could have important effects on macrophyte communities in lotic systems."

Recently, an on-road study has shown that drivers may prefer to deactivate full-range ACC when closing in on a slower leader and to overrule it by pressing the gas pedal a few seconds after the activation of the system. Notwithstanding the influence of these control transitions on driver behaviour, a theoretical framework explaining driver decisions to transfer control and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC is currently missing. This research develops a modelling framework describing the underlying decision making process of drivers with full-range ACC at an operational level, grounded on Risk Allostasis Theory (RAT). Based on this theory, a driver will choose to resume manual control or to regulate the ACC target speed if its perceived level of risk feeling and task difficulty falls outside the range considered acceptable to maintain the system active. The feeling of risk and task difficulty evaluation is formulated as a generalized ordered probit model with random thresholds, which vary between drivers and within drivers over time. The ACC system state choices are formulated as logit models and the ACC target speed regulations as regression models, in which correlations between system state choices and target speed regulations are captured explicitly. This continuous-discrete choice model framework is able to address interdependencies across drivers' decisions in terms of causality, unobserved driver characteristics, and state dependency, and to capture inconsistencies in drivers' decision making that might be caused by human factors. The model was estimated using a dataset collected in an on-road experiment with full range ACC. The results reveal that driver decisions to resume manual control and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC can be interpreted based on the RAT. The model can be used to forecast driver response to a driving assistance system that adapts its settings to prevent control transitions while guaranteeing safety and comfort. The model can also be implemented into a microscopic traffic flow simulation to evaluate the impact of ACC on traffic flow efficiency and safety accounting for control transitions and target speed regulations.

It is established that Platonov's interest in Gorky's personality and work was manifested in a review of the play in 1921. It turns out that this review was written in the context of Platonov's series of articles on hydration, which he considered the main condition for overcoming hunger. This circumstance gives grounds to put forward a hypothesis that Platonov knew about the activities of Gorky as the initiator of the committee for helping the hungry and the organizer of this assistance abroad. This gives grounds for the conclusion that in 1921 the writers were active participants in the program of real assistance to the starving, and Platonov devoted several years to this activity (the period from 1921 to 1926). The reasons for the differences between Platonov and Gorky in understanding the goals and tasks of Soviet literature and the work of the Soviet writer are elucidated. The difference in positions was manifested in Gorky's ambiguous play ``High Voltage{''}, which was not published in the Gorky's almanac and was not staged in the theater, although it is one of the vertices of the innovative dramaturgy of Platonov."

Whether there is a link between ranging and laying hen welfare remains unclear. We analysed the relationships between ranging by individual hens on a commercial free-range layer farm and behavioural, physiological and health measures of animal welfare. We hypothesised that hens that access the range more will be (1) less fearful in general and in response to novelty and humans, (2) have better health in terms of physical body condition and (3) have a reduced physiological stress response to behavioural tests of fear and health assessments than hens that use the range less. Using radio frequency identification tracking across two flocks, we recorded individual hens' frequency, duration and consistency of ranging. We also assessed how far hens ventured into the range based on three zones: 0 to 2.4, 2.4 to 11.4 or >11.4 m from the shed. We assessed hen welfare using a variety of measures including: tonic immobility, open field, novel object, human approach, and human avoidance (HAV) behavioural tests; stress-induced plasma corticosterone response and faecal glucocorticoid metabolites; live weight, comb colour, and beak, plumage, footpad, and keel bone condition. Range use was positively correlated with plasma corticosterone response, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, and greater flight distance during HAV. Hens that used the range more, moved towards rather than away from the novel object more often than hens that ranged less. Distance ranged from the shed was significantly associated with comb colour and beak condition, in that hens with darker combs and more intact beaks ranged further. Overall the findings suggest that there is no strong link between outdoor range usage and laying hen welfare. Alternatively, it may be that hens that differed in their ranging behaviour showed few differences in measures of welfare because free-range systems provide hens with adequate choice to cope with their environment. Further research into the relationship between individual range access and welfare is needed to test this possibility."

Milne Edwards, 1853), under food shortage, habitat choice in the presence of predators, and cannibalistic behavior by comparing their response to the popular culture plant Elodea nuttallii and the structurally more complex Myriophyllum verticillatum L. in a series of mesocosm experiments. Mitten crabs were found to consume and thus reduce the biomass of Elodea, whereas no negative impact on Myriophyllum biomass was recorded. In the absence of adult crabs, juveniles preferred to settle in Elodea habitats (appearance frequency among the plants: 64.2 +/- 5.9\%) but selected for Myriophyllum instead when adult crabs were present (appearance frequency among the plants: 59.5 +/- 4.9\%). The mortality rate of mitten crabs in the absence of plant shelter was higher under food shortage, primarily due to cannibalism. The proportion of molting crabs dying in the structurally more complex Myriophyllum habitats was significantly lower than in the less complex Elodea habitats, indicating that Myriophyllum provides better protection from cannibalistic behavior, likely due to its structurally more complex canopy. Stable isotope analyses of crab samples revealed a trophic shift in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 (Delta delta C-13: 2.2-4.0 parts per thousand; Delta delta N-15: 1.5-2.8 parts per thousand) during the experimental period. Significant positive correlations between body mass and delta C-13 and delta N-15 were recorded, suggesting that cannibalistic feeding might further increase crab growth and lead to ontogenetic increases in trophic position with increasing size. Our study overall demonstrates that a combination of submerged aquatic vegetation functioning as a highly suitable food with other less palatable plant species acting as efficient refuges against predators may be the optimal method of plant stocking in mitten crab aquacultures to ensure both high crab growth and a high survival rate."

However, only few physicians use an enteral nutrition. The aim of this study was to analyze the representations and practices of physicians about gastrostomy in patients above 70 years-old, and to identify difficulties encountered in decision making in geriatrics. Materials ans methods. - This study was a qualitative research based on individual, semi-directed interviews. Results. - Ten physicians, geriatrics and palliative care, were interviewed. Their theoretical knowledge followed French and European recommendations in terms of indication, contra-indication and surveillance of risk factors for gastrostomy. Physicians had a pejorative representation of gastrostomy. It depended on the representation of the ``food{''}, which is specific, according to the personality, the design of care and sociocultural references. Difficulties encountered by physicians in decision-making were related to lack of training, lack of experience and influence of individual representations. Decision-making required a global and personalized evaluation of each patient. To make a decision, physician considered the patient's opinion first. Conclusion. - Awareness of one's own representations can improve support. Methods to improve geriatric practice about gastrostomy are: training physicians, analysis of complex cases, formalizing multidisciplinary meetings and conducting collegiality ethical reflections.

The first intuitive expectation is that fishing causes evolution toward reduced boldness because it selectively removes actively foraging individuals due to their higher encounter rate and vulnerability to typical gear. However, life-history theory predicts that fishing, through shortened life span, favors accelerated life histories, potentially leading to increased foraging and its frequent correlate, boldness. Additionally, individuals with accelerated life histories mature younger and at a smaller size and therefore spend more of their life at a smaller size where mortality is higher. This life-history evolution may prohibit increases in risk-taking behavior and boldness, thus selecting for reduced risk-taking and boldness. Here, we aim to clarify which of these three selective patterns ends up being dominant. We study how behavior-selective fishing affects the optimal behavioral and life-history traits using a state-dependent dynamic programming model. Different gear types were modeled as being selective for foraging or hiding/resting individuals along a continuous axis, including unselective fishing. Compared with unselective harvesting, gears targeting hiding/resting individuals led toward evolution of increased foraging rates and elevated natural mortality rate, while targeting foraging individuals led to evolution of decreased foraging rates and lower natural mortality rate. Interestingly, changes were predicted for traits difficult to observe in the wild (natural mortality and behavior) whereas the more regularly observed traits (length-at-age, age at maturity, and reproductive investment) showed only little sensitivity to the behavioral selectivity."

The Rate Your Plate (RYP) diet score was used to measure diet quality at baseline and discharge. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors of diet score change in a subsample with goal-setting data (n = 615). Analysis of variance was conducted in the subset with complete weight data (n = 584) to compare weight loss between those who improved their RYP scores versus those who did not. Results: Participants were 27.9\% female, with a mean age of 63.4 11.5 y. The average body mass index at baseline was 30.3 +/- 6.8, and 51.7\% reported diet change and/or weight loss as a goal. After an average of 33 CR sessions, 27.3\% improved their RYP scores by at least 1 risk category (mean score, 54.0 +/- 9.0 vs 58.2 +/- 7.3, P < .001) and the average weight loss was 1.5 +/- 2.9 kg (P < .001).

There was no difference between sex, habits, lifestyle, habitat, number of meals, nutritional background, commercial diet, and reproductive status. However, development of coprophagia appears to be influenced by the presence of a coprophagic cohabitant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Although previous studies have suggested a link between boldness and fitness components, little evidence is available on the behavioural mechanisms mediating this relationship in the wild. Because habitat use is the outcome of the trade-off between the costs and benefits associated with using each habitat type, we evaluated between-individual differences in habitat use of 64 GPS-collared female roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using multinomial logit mixed models. To investigate whether deer differed in their habitat use tactics in relation to their personality type and their annual reproductive success, we assessed the link between individual habitat use patterns, boldness (measured as the strength of behavioural responsiveness to handling) and annual reproductive success (measured by the presence/absence of fawns at heel during autumn). Although daily and seasonal variations in the risk-resource landscapes clearly drove patterns of habitat use, individuals adopted contrasting habitat use tactics depending on their position along the shy-bold gradient and their reproductive status. Shy individuals occupied safer woodland more frequently, even at night when risk is lower. In contrast, bold individuals were better able to exploit rich open habitats. When this included mature autumn crops, these females weaned more offspring. Finally, irrespective of personality type, females that used meadows more often also achieved higher annual reproductive success. Overall, we demonstrate that individuals express divergent habitat use tactics as a function of their ability to avoid exposure to risk and their annual reproductive success.

Such bats may, however, encounter dangerous diurnal raptors with an early start to their nightly feeding, and thus may face predation-related trade-offs in deciding when to emerge from a daytime roost. Non-predator-related factors could also come into play in this nightly decision. We used an information-theoretic approach to examine which combination of a wide range of variables exerts the greatest influence over emergence times from maternity roosts in a population of Indiana bats, Myotis sodalis, covering a 12-year period. Our competing statistical models were based on two broad environmental influences on emergence times: predators and physical (meteorological and astronomical) variables. The best-performing model included most of the variables associated with antipredator trade-offs, assuming that bats emerging before or near sunset experience a foraging benefit and a substantial risk of predation by diurnal raptors. Accordingly, state-dependent behaviour was apparent, with emergence beginning earlier during the more energetically demanding portion of the reproductive cycle. During lactation (the most demanding period), about 20\% of emergence events began before sunset, compared to only 5\% during colony formation. Earlier emergence was also associated with high cloud cover (darker conditions), larger roost populations and roosts located deep into the forest. Moonlight at sunset, however, was absent from the best-supported model and had no apparent influence on emergence times. Overall, the emergence behaviour of our species is consistent with a trade-off between energetic needs and predation risk, most likely due to the temporal overlap of early emergences with the activity period of diurnal raptors. This behaviour may be more common than expected in temperate-zone bats. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a static consequence of a predator's mere presence within an ecosystem. We tested the prediction that an LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly dynamic map with ``peaks{''} and ``valleys{''} that alternate across the diel (24-h) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1,000-km(2) of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing."

A particular case of behavioral bottleneck (i.e. conflicting interests) faced by animals in urban environments is how they will modulate the defence of their offspring against the potential danger represented by humans, an aspect that has received scarce research attention. We examined the nest defense against humans by a dense breeding population of a raptor, the Black Kite Milvus migrans, within the megacity of Delhi (India). Here, kites live on a diet dominated by human waste and meat offered through religiously motivated bird feeding practices. Nest defense levels increased with the number of offspring, and with the progression of the breeding season. Defense also intensified close to ritual-feeding areas and with increasing human waste in the streets, suggesting synergistic effects of food availability, parental investment, personality-boldness and habituation to humans, with consequent attenuation of fear. Thus, the behavioural response to a perceived threat reflected the spatial mosaic of activity of humans in the city streets, their cultural practices of ritual-feeding, and their waste-management. For synurbic species, at the higher-end spectrum of adaptation to an urban life, human cultural practices and attitudes may well be the most defining dimensions of their urban niche. Our results suggest that, after initial urban colonization, animals may continue to adapt to the typically complex, heterogeneous environments of cities through fine-grained behavioural adjustments to human practices and activities."

Despite a large number of ecological studies, often examining animal diversity and abundance before and after fires, the reasons as to why some species perform better than others remain obscure. We examine how especially small mammals, which generally have high rates of energy expenditure and food requirements, deal with fires and post-fire conditions. We evaluate whether mammalian torpor, characterised by substantial reductions in body temperature, metabolic rate and water loss, plays a functional role in survival of mammals impacted by fires. Importantly, torpor permits small mammals to reduce their activity and foraging, and to survive on limited food. Torpid small mammals (marsupials and bats) can respond to smoke and arouse from torpor, which provides them with the possibility to evade direct exposure to fire, although their response is often slowed when ambient temperature is low. Post-fire conditions increase expression of torpor with a concomitant decrease in activity for free-ranging echidnas and small forest-dwelling marsupials, in response to reduced cover and reduced availability of terrestrial insects. Presence of charcoal and ash increases torpor use by captive small marsupials beyond food restriction alone, likely in anticipation of detrimental post-fire conditions. Interestingly, although volant bats use torpor on every day after fires, they respond by decreasing torpor duration, and increasing activity, perhaps because of the decrease in clutter and increase in foraging opportunities due to an increase in aerial insects. Our summary shows that torpor is an important tool for post-fire survival and, although the physiological and behavioural responses of small mammals to fire are complex, they seem to reflect energetic requirements and mode of foraging. We make recommendations on the conditions during management burns that are least likely to impact hetero-thermic mammals."

However, robust assessment of these effects is challenging. The management of human activities that have nonlethal effects on wildlife is a specific example of a fundamental ecological problem: how to understand the population-level consequences of changes in the behavior or physiology of individual animals that are caused by external stressors. In this study, we review recent applications of a conceptual framework for assessing and predicting these consequences for marine mammal populations. We explore the range of models that can be used to formalize the approach and we identify critical research gaps. We also provide a decision tree that can be used to select the most appropriate model structure given the available data. Synthesis and applications: The implementation of this framework has moved the focus of discussion of the management of nonlethal disturbances on marine mammal populations away from a rhetorical debate about defining negligible impact and toward a quantitative understanding of long-term population-level effects. Here we demonstrate the framework's general applicability to other marine and terrestrial systems and show how it can support integrated modeling of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that regulate trait-mediated, indirect interactions in ecological communities, that is, the nonconsumptive effects of a predator or stressor on a species' behavior, physiology, or life history."

In fact, the safe use of veterinary drugs in the production process has become one of important guarantees for the quality safety of agricultural products. It's of great significance to regulate the breeding farmers' safe use of veterinary drugs and to create a safe and healthy production environment for agricultural products. A field survey of individual and large-scale swine breeding farmers in four typical provinces including Henan, Shandong, Jiangxi and Guizhou generated 397 questionnaires. This field survey conducted the internal and external classification of breeding farmers' safe use of veterinary drugs and defined the breeding farmers' safe use of veterinary drugs in the light of dosage, type and standardized operation of veterinary drugs. Based on Lewin's behavior theory, the survey used the structural equation modeling method to systematically examine the generation path of breeding farmers' safe use of veterinary drugs. The comprehensive analysis reveals that breeding farmers' knowledge about veterinary drugs, the attitudes toward the government supervision and the market environment of breeding activities all exert some effects on breeding farmers' use of veterinary drugs. Some suggestions and countermeasures for breeding farmers' safe use of veterinary drugs are provided as follows: First, more efforts should be pumped into publicity and instruction so that breeding farmers can have a better understanding of veterinary drugs. Second, preferential policies should be formulated to encourage the breeding farmers' participation in the industrial organizations of swine breeding farmers, and advocate the industrial organizations' active provision of different technical trainings. Third, the communication and cooperation platform should be created among breeding farmers, slaughter and processing plants and supermarkets, the poultry insurance market should be regulated, and the insurance purchase process should be improved. Fourth, when more subsidies for harm-free and environment-friendly veterinary drugs are provided, more serious punishments should be imposed on the unsafe use of veterinary drugs to offer policy support for the breeding farmers' standardized use of veterinary drugs."

Understanding the spatial structure of individual variation is critical to assessing the mechanisms and scale of species-level ecological and evolutionary responses. But the continuity and complexity of streams can make it difficult to discern spatial structure, and data on individual variation spanning spatial scales are rare. 2. Our goal was to objectively resolve the scale of ecological and evolutionary processes affecting the salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus by testing for spatial structure in individual variation across a headwater stream network. We used 3 years of spatially explicit capture mark recapture data from four headwater streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, to test for individual variation in survival at three scales: (a) among c. 2-km(2) watersheds, (b) in 500-m downstream and upstream reaches within watersheds and (c) in riffle and pool habitats along reaches. We also tested for corresponding spatial variation in individual body condition and morphology to gain insight on the causes and implications of variation in survival. 3. Survival of G. porphyriticus larvae was constant among watersheds, but differed by reach and habitat. Larval survival was higher in upstream reaches than downstream reaches, matching the distribution of predatory brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), which were restricted to down-stream reaches. Larval survival was also higher in pools than riffles. Survival of G. porphyriticus adults was constant at all scales. 4. Larval body condition was higher in downstream reaches than upstream reaches. Both larvae and adults differed in morphology at the habitat scale: individuals in pools had longer limbs than individuals in riffles. 5. Negative covariation in larval survival and body condition at the reach scale suggests that there is a trade-off between fitness and proximate performance along streams. The surprising differences between habitats in survival and morphology show the potential for fine-scale ecology evolution interactions in streams, potentially driven by differences in flow and gradient conditions in riffles and pools. 6. Our results suggest that the larval stage is key to understanding individual, population and community-level processes affecting G. porphyriticus. More broadly, this research provides a novel empirical link between traditional studies of fine-scale ecological complexity in streams and recent studies showing consistent spatial dynamics at the network scale. By documenting differences in survival, body condition and morphology at reach and habitat scales, we hope this work shows the feasibility and value of spatially explicit approaches to species-level ecological and evolutionary questions in streams."

Noise and infrastructure often change behavior and community composition, with potential physical costs such as decreased condition. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns are virtually unknown. One potential driver of condition within a species is the diversity of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigate how the urban habitat affects the gut microbiome of White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) males using spatial analyses of land cover (impervious, scrub, grass, and trees) at the regional level and territory level in urban San Francisco, CA and nearby rural Point Reyes, California. We hypothesized that urbanization of habitats affects gut microbial composition and diversity, potentially through direct effects on diet and/or indirect environmental effects. We measured gut microbial community diversity from 16s rRNA sequences amplified from cloacal swabs. We find that the urban and rural male gut microbiomes are significantly different, such that the urban gut microbiome is more diverse than the rural gut microbiome. This relationship may be due to more variable land cover types in urban habitats as compared to rural habitats, which are mainly composed of native scrub. We do not find support for regional impervious cover affecting the gut microbiome, but the more precise territory level analyses show that higher tree cover correlates with increased alpha diversity and impervious cover correlates with relative abundances of gut microbial taxa (Unifrac beta diversity). Although some studies show that gut diversity affects physiology, our measures of body condition do not indicate a strong relationship. Our results highlight how changes in the landscape may affect the gut microbiome of animals in an ever-urbanizing world, and provide a baseline for future studies of how anthropogenic change affects communities at multiple levels."

Several countries have tried to promote folic acid intake through mandatory fortification programs to reduce neural tube defects. Supplementation combined with mandatory fortification of foods has led to high levels of folic acid and related metabolites in women of childbearing age. Recent studies have reported that oversupplementation, defined as exceeding either the recommended dietary allowance or the upper limit of the daily reference intake of folic acid, may have negative effects on human health. This review examines whether maternal oversupplementation with folic acid affects the neurodevelopment of offspring.

These responses may also be affected by the animal's physiological state (e.g., nutrition level, parasitism, or prior injury), which could alter normal responses to kairomones. In this study, we examined effects of leg autotomy (the voluntary sacrifice of a leg) on subsequent responses to predator chemical cues in females of the riparian-zone wolf spider Pardosa valens. In a fully-crossed design, spiders with all legs intact or with one leg removed were exposed to one of two cue treatments for 90min: a control (no predator cue) or one with chemical cues (silk and excreta) from a larger sympatric wolf spider, Rabidosa santrita. We then introduced an R. santrita into each container, and recorded subsequent survival of P. valens. Survivorship was significantly higher for individuals previously exposed to predator cues than for those in the control group; however, autotomy had no effect on survivorship, which was similar for both intact and autotomized spiders in both the predator-cue and control treatments. In addition, although P. valens were more likely to be found off the substrate than on it when the predator was added in each of the four treatment pairings, this initial position did not influence survivorship. These results therefore indicate that P. valens can behaviorally respond to predator kairomones in ways that reduce their risk of predation, but that this response is unaffected by the prior sacrifice of a leg."

In a series of experiments, we have studied the behavioural responses of goldfish (prey) and little egrets (predator) when brought together in a large laboratory apparatus - an aviary with three pools of water. To obtain a baseline, we measured their behaviour in an aviary without manipulating any variable (Katz et al., 2010). Because the results of that study suggested that both fish and egrets follow the rules of optimal foraging, we undertook a series of experiments in which we manipulated the number of food patches (Katz et al., 2014a), the number of fish per pool (Katz et al., 2014b; Vijayan et al., 2018a), and the size of goldfish refuges (vijayaa et al., 2018b). In each case, the results supported the hypothesis of optimal behaviour. Mitchell (2018, this issue) makes four predictions about the behaviours of both species as the abundance of fish resources changes in a system such as the aviary. Specifically: (1) Prey should respond very weakly, if at all, to variation in the food ration among patches. (2) The predator should allocate more time to patches with a higher prey-food ration. (3) When moving to another patch, the predator should choose the patch with the higher prey-food ration more often than it would at random. (4) The predator will kill more prey in patches receiving a larger ration of prey-food. Aims: Explore the effect of varying the abundance of fish-food on the behaviours of goldfish and little egrets in the aviary. Determine whether variation in their behaviours agrees with the predictions of Mitchell's theoretical model. Methods: We used little egrets (the predators) and goldfish (the prey). We conducted experiments in two identical aviaries (7 m diameter). Each aviary contained three separate patches, i.e. three pools (1.52 m diameter, 0.60 m deep, similar to 1000 litres), each open to foraging by a single egret in the aviary. A fixed cover (22.75 cm radius) at the centre of each pool provided a refuge for the goldfish. Each pool had 15 fish. We manipulated intraspecific competition by offering three different amounts of goldfish food in an aviary each day: full (1.13 g per day), half (0.56 g per day), and quarter (0.28 g per day) rations. We then observed and recorded the behaviours of both players for 6 hours. Results: Patch-to-patch variation in the food ration had no effect on fish activity. But the egret allocated more time to foraging in the patch where the prey-food ration was highest (1.13 g). When moving to another patch, the egret moved to the patches containing high food rations (1.13 and 0.56 g) rather than the patch with the lowest food ration (0.28 g). And the predator caught significantly fewer goldfish in these poorest patches. Thus all four predictions were validated."

Exposure of P. maculatus tadpoles to chemical cues of caged predator (crabs, Barytelphusa spp.) fed with either conspecific or heterogeneric tadpoles, or were starved elicited defense behavior (by avoiding predator zone) in them. Such a behavior was not evident when exposed to predators housed in a glass beaker (visual cues). Both early (Gosner stage 27-28) and later (Gosner stage 35-36) stage tadpoles when exposed to caged predators (fed with conspecific tadpoles), prey tadpoles spent less time swimming and remained motionless for longer periods. Yet, the time spent by prey in feeding was unaffected. Further, the predator avoidance behavior exhibited by them was of the same intensity regardless of whether the caged predators were fed or starved implying the influence of predator's kairomones. Tadpoles reared with caged predator reached the metamorphic climax stage (MC stage; Gosner stage 42) earlier than those reared without a predator. Size at emergence (Gosner stage 46) was comparable in both the groups. The findings suggest that P. maculatus tadpoles assess predation risk chiefly by sensing kairomones of the predator in eliciting antipredator defense behaviors. Accelerated development and early metamorphosis without any compromise of the size at emergence may be due to their unaltered feeding activity."

The role of abiotic factors in its establishment, abundance and projections of risk of further spread into several areas has been studied. These mussels may respond to multiple environmental stressors, such as temperature, through physiological mechanisms, behavioral responses, mortality or some combination of these. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavioral responses (valve closing), glycogen concentrations and mortality of L. fortunei under four different temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) during a chronic test (30 days). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare glycogen concentrations across days of the experiment and at the different temperatures. Differences in valve-closing behavior and mortality among temperatures were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA. We observed that most of the mussels maintained at 5 degrees C closed their valves (74.7 +/- 15.3\%), indicating that they remain inactive at low temperatures. The glycogen levels significantly differed among the temperatures tested. These differences occurred mainly due to the high glycogen values observed in mussels exposed to 10 degrees C. Stability in glycogen concentrations was observed within each particular temperature. The cumulative mortality was higher at extreme temperatures (5 degrees C and 30 degrees C). The ideal temperature for laboratory maintenance and tests is approximately 20 degrees C. Our data also show that L. fortunei can survive and maintain their energy reserves (glycogen) for several days at 5 degrees C, an important feature related to its invasion success."

Epigenetics is a chemical modification-based genetic mechanism that is affected by various nutritional factors. One-carbon metabolism is a metabolic system associated with methyl residue that is supplied from folic acid. Therefore, from the epigenetic point of view, proper intake of folic acid is important for pregnant women not only to prevent congenital abnormalities such as neural tube defect but also to prevent various adult disorders of the offspring. Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor of coronary heart disease, and epidemiological studies on Dutch winter famine, Jewish holocaust survivors, and Chinese famine suggested that prenatal malnutrition was associated with the dyslipidemia. Recent animal studies revealed that malnutrition in utero causes an epigenetic change in the Ppar alpha gene, which accelerates the activity of delta-6 desaturase and delta-5 desaturase, that potentially induces dyslipidemia in adulthood. It has been known that overnutrition also increased the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Recent animal studies revealed that high-fat diet increased DNA methylation in the promoter region of delta-6 desaturase gene (Fads 2) that downregulates the gene expression in the arterial smooth muscle, which potentially contributes to cardiovascular diseases. Taken together, either insufficient or excessive nutrition alters epigenetic modification of genes that encodes enzymes associated with lipid metabolism. This altered epigenetic state persists during one's lifetime, which is potentially involved in noncommunicable diseases in adulthood."

K.","EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH","2050-6201",NA,"","153-166","2018","","10.1093/emph/eoy014","Lay Summary: This review sets out the hypothesis that life history trade-offs in the maternal generation favour the emergence of similar trade-offs in the offspring generation, mediated by the partitioning of maternal investment between pregnancy and lactation, and that these trade-offs help explain widely reported associations between growth trajectories and NCD risk. Growth patterns in early life predict the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but adaptive explanations remain controversial. It is widely assumed that NCDs occur either because of physiological adjustments to early constraints, or because early ecological cues fail to predict adult environmental conditions (mismatch). I present an inter-generational perspective on developmental plasticity, based on the over-arching hypothesis that a key axis of variability in maternal metabolism derives from life history trade-offs, which influence how individual mothers partition nutritional investment in their offspring between pregnancy and lactation. I review evidence for three resulting predictions: (i) Allocating relatively more energy to growth during development promotes the capacity to invest in offspring during pregnancy. Relevant mechanisms include greater fat-free mass and metabolic turnover, and a larger physical space for fetal growth. (ii) Allocating less energy to growth during development constrains fetal growth of the offspring, but mothers may compensate by a tendency to attain higher adiposity around puberty, ecological conditions permitting, which promotes nutritional investment during lactation. (iii) Since the partitioning of maternal investment between pregnancy and lactation impacts the allocation of energy to `maintenance' as well as growth, it is expected to shape offspring NCD risk as well as adult size and body composition. Overall, this framework predicts that life history trade-offs in the maternal generation favour the emergence of similar trade-offs in the offspring generation, mediated by the partitioning of maternal investment between pregnancy and lactation, and that these trade-offs help explain widely reported associations between growth trajectories and NCD risk."

5598,"Nutritional Ecology of Elk During Summer and Autumn in the Pacific Northwest","Cook, John G. and Cook, Rachel C. and Davis, Ronald W. and Irwin, Larry L.","WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS","0084-0173","195","","1-81","2016","","10.1002/wmon.1020","Elk (Cervus elaphus) in the western United States are an economically and socially valuable wildlife species. They have featured species status for federal land management planning; hence, considerable modeling focused on habitat evaluation and land management planning has been undertaken for elk. The extent to which these and other habitat models for large ungulates account for influences of nutritional resources varies greatly, probably because of varying recognition of the importance of nutrition and uncertainty about how to measure and model nutrition. Our primary goals were to 1) develop greater understanding of how habitat conditions influence foraging dynamics and nutrition of elk in summer and autumn; and 2) illustrate an ecological framework for evaluating and predicting nutritional resources so that nutritional needs of elk can be integrated within landscape-scale plans, population models, and habitat evaluation models. We evaluated foraging responses of elk to clearcut logging and commercial thinning, forest succession, and season across ecological site potentials. We also identified the extent to which plant communities satisfied nutritional requirements of lactating female elk and their calves. Our study was conducted in the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest on industrial and public timberlands. We evaluated relations between habitat conditions and elk nutrition in plant communities representing a range in stand age and ecological conditions at 3 study areas, 1 near the Canadian border in the north Cascades Mountains (Nooksack), 1 in the Coast range southwest of Olympia, Washington (Willapa Hills), and the third in the central Cascades near Springfield, Oregon (Springfield), from late June to November, 2000-2002. In 98-143 macroplots per study area, we measured forage abundance by plant species, digestible energy content by plant life-form group, and forest overstory. In a subset of these macroplots (similar to 30 per study area), we held 4 tame lactating elk with calves in electrified pens (n = 15-25 adult elk per year), and sampled activity budgets, dietary composition, forage selection, and other measures of foraging behavior; dietary digestible energy (DE; kcal/g) and protein (DP; \%) levels; and intake rates of these nutrients. In 15 of these pens, we held elk for extended periods (13-21 days) to monitor changes in body fat of adults and growth of calves. We developed equations to predict dietary DE and DP and per-minute intake rates of each in a nutrition prediction model that reflected vegetation attributes and ecological site influences. Total abundance of forage in the western hemlock series after clearcut logging in low to moderate elevations (<= 1,000 m) ranged from a peak of 3,000-4,500 kg/ha in 5- to 10-year-old stands to 100-300 kg/ha in 20- to 50-year-old stands with only moderate increases through late succession. Patterns were similar in higher elevation forests (1,000-1,800 m), although peaks and troughs in forage abundance developed more slowly. Deciduous shrubs, forbs, and graminoids were abundant in early seral stages after stand disturbance, but these were rapidly replaced by shade-tolerant evergreen shrubs and ferns as conifer overstories closed 15-20 years later in low-elevation forest zones, and 20-40 years later in high-elevation zones. Digestible energy within plant life-form groups generally declined with season and with advancing succession, increased with elevation, and was highest in forbs and deciduous shrubs and lowest in evergreen shrubs and shade-tolerant ferns. Levels of DE in elk diets exhibited a strong asymptotic relation with abundance (kg/ha) of plant species that were eaten in proportions equal to or greater than availability (i.e., accepted species). Marked declines in dietary DE occurred in stands containing <400 kg/ha to 500 kg/ha of accepted species, largely because elk began to increase consumption of avoided species, and these typically contained low levels of DE. The asymptotic pattern was generally consistent among seasons, study areas, and habitat types (potential natural vegetation categories), although the asymptote averaged 10-12\% greater in high-versus low-elevation forests. Abundance of accepted species in early seral stands averaged 7-10 times that in mid and late seral stages, and dietary DE levels varied accordingly. Dietary DE was little influenced by thinning in 20- to 60-year-old stands. In contrast, levels of dietary DP were unrelated to forage composition and abundance of accepted or avoided species, and varied little between low and high-elevation forests. Dietary DP increased with overstory canopy cover, was higher in thinned and hardwood stands, particularly those hardwood stands with saturated soils in late summer, declined with season, and was lowest in the driest forest communities in our study. Overall, soil moisture regime and season accounted for the majority of variation in dietary DP. Relations between nutrient intake rate and vegetation conditions varied among study areas and habitat types. Nevertheless, elk maintained about double the intake rate of DE in early seral stages versus closed-canopy forests. Intake rate of DP was similar between early seral versus closed-canopy forests, despite modestly lower dietary DP in early seral stages. Protein intake rate was greater in thinned and hardwood-riparian stands. In early seral stages, dietary DE typically met the requirement of 2.7 kcal/g of ingested forage (necessary to maintain body fat levels of lactating elk in summer) in the low-elevation forest zones and exceeded that level in high-elevation forest zones. In closed-canopy forests, dietary DE averaged below requirements, markedly so in low-elevation forests (2.25-2.5 kcal/g) and moderately so in high-elevation forests (2.4-2.65 kcal/g). Evidence of deficiencies based on DE intake rate was greater, averaging about 50\% of requirements (28 kcal/min; 21,000 kcal/day) in closed-canopy forests and 80\% of requirements in early seral stages. In contrast, dietary DP and DP intake rates generally approached or exceeded estimated requirements (6.8\% DP; 380 g/day) in many habitat types that we sampled, with the greatest potential for deficient DP intake rates in relatively dry, low-elevation forests. Body fat dynamics and growth of calves confirmed nutritional deficiencies suggested by our data on DE intake. Adult elk lost body fat during all trials at rates generally in accordance with expectations at the dietary DE levels they consumed, and rate of change in body fat was inversely related to abundance of accepted species. Calves grew at about half the rate of which they are capable (1 kg/day) if summer nutrition is sufficient. Daily calf growth was positively related to their mother's dietary DE and protein intake levels. Elk compensated for limited foraging options in many plant communities via several behavioral strategies. Selection was generally strong for plants with higher DE levels, where selected species composed nearly 5 times more of the diet than did species that elk avoided, yet avoided species were 10 times more abundant. As abundance of accepted species declined below approximately 400 kg/ha, elk increased intake of avoided species. This strategy delayed declines in per-minute forage and DE intake rate as long as abundance of accepted species remained above roughly 200 kg/ha, despite declining dietary DE levels apparent at <400 kg/ha to 500 kg/ha of accepted species. Elk traveled faster while foraging to compensate for plant communities with very low abundance of total forage, increased bite rate as bite mass declined, increased time spent feeding at night in pens with low abundance of total forage or relatively low dietary DE levels, and increased rumination time particularly as dietary fiber levels increased. Dietary DE, DP, and intake rates of these nutrients therefore were robust to substantial variation in overall forage quality and quantity. Nevertheless, these strategies were insufficient to compensate for low abundance of high-quality forage typically present under closed forest canopies. Our nutrition model included nonlinear and multiple regression equations to predict 1) dietary DE (kcal/g of ingested forage), based primarily on abundance of accepted species (r(2) = 0.49-0.62); and 2) dietary DP (\% of ingested forage), based primarily on abundance of accepted species, overstory canopy cover, and site characteristics intended to index soil moisture (r(2) = 0.60). Additional equations to predict intake rates per minute included the same covariates, but the variance explained was modestly lower (DE intake: r(2) = 0.43; DP intake: r(2) = 0.45-0.54). With these equations, we created nutrition-succession profiles to illustrate dietary DE and DP intake dynamics across the successional sequence for each habitat type and study area. These profiles may serve as inputs for spatially explicit maps of nutritional resources for elk. Because they were developed using nutrition data from foraging elk, they should help alleviate much of the uncertainty arising from proxy variables often used as indices of nutritional resources. Our data demonstrated that nutritional resources in forests of western Oregon and Washington are generally deficient for lactating elk in summer and early autumn. They provided evidence that inadequate nutritional resources are largely responsible for low body fat in autumn and reduced pregnancy rates reported for many elk herds in the Pacific Northwest. Our data also illustrated that nutritional value of habitats is highly variable depending on ecological context, disturbance, and succession. Thus, how, if, and where forested elk habitats are managed can greatly influence the nutritional suitability of an area. Finally, our data indicate a considerable need for integrating nutritional assessments in landscape planning processes where maintaining abundant and productive elk populations is one of several forest management goals in the Pacific Northwest.

A particularly promising approach is to apply predator scents to manipulate the cost/benefit ratio that influences the behavioral decisions made by prey and other predators about where to forage or rest. However, such olfactory manipulations are not always successful. Using insights from size-structured food webs, we develop a novel integrative model of the information that animals acquire from eavesdropping on predator and conspecific scents. We show how animals can use the information content in predator scents to derive knowledge of other predators and competitors and thus influence their decision to stay in or leave an area. This model framework clarifies how predator scents can influence all trophic levels, from interference competition directed at smaller predators, to predation and herbivory, and exploits direct and indirect pathways to promote landscapes of fear that influence spatial and temporal patch use in target animals. We illustrate how the application of this conceptual model can focus future research to enhance the use of predator scent-based deterrents in conservation and management. This integrated model shows great promise for addressing wildlife management concerns and for eventually improving the success and efficacy of traditional management techniques."

While the behavioral phenotype of ASD is well described, the search for reliable `autism biomarkers' continues. CONTENT: Insulin growth factor (IGF) is essential for the myelination of developing fetal neurons; this is in addition to the well-known links between IGF, maternal inlammation, infection and autism supporting IGF as a potential marker. Combining IGF data with data regarding levels of the known markers, serotonin and anti-myelin basic protein, in order to calculate an autism index, could provide a new diagnostic method for at-risk neonates. Disruptions to multiple pathophysiological systems, including redox, folate, methylation, tryptophan metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism, have been well documented in autistic patients. Maternal infection and inlammation have known links with autism. Autoimmunity has therefore been a well-studied area of autism research. The potential of using autoantibodies as novel biomarkers for autism, in addition to providing insights into the neurodevelopmental processes that lead to autism. SUMMARY: The six proposed causes of autism involve both metabolic and immunologic dysfunctions and include: increased oxidative stress; decreased methionine metabolism and trans-sulfuration: aberrant free and bound metal burden; gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances; immune/inlammation dysregulation; and autoimmune targeting. A newborn screening program for early-onset ASD should be capable of utilizing a combination of ASD-associated biomarkers representative of the six proposed causes of autism in order to identify newborns at risk. The biomarkers discussed in this article are useful to guide the selection, eficacy, and suficiency of biomedical interventions, which would likely include nutritional supplementation, dietary changes, and speciic medications for treating GI pathogens and reducing inlammation."

Urban lifestyle is fueled by excessive food intake and lack of activity in overweight and obese children. The assessment of the children's Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the indicators to assess the nutritional status of children. One strategy that can be used is the transtheoretical model (TTM) approach which is behavior change that helps children and parents in making more effective decisions to reduce health-risk behaviors among children so that the children's BMI can decrease. This study aims to identify the differences between children's BMI before and after the TTM approach. METHODS: This research was conducted in the district area of Tamalanrea and Biringkanaya, Makassar. The design used is the Quasy Experiment namely pre- and post-test with control group design. Research subjects were overweight or obese children in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of elementary school. The samples in the treatment group consisted of 31 participants, while the control group consisted of 33 participants which were selected using purposive sampling. Intervention research was conducted during a six month period by providing guide books on healthy lifestyle, visiting the families every month using questionnaires, and measurements of children's height, weight and BMI using WHO's AntrhoPlus software year 2007. RESULTS: Post-pretest results showed the average value of the treatment group's BMI was -1,48 and the control group was 1,35. This means that the treatment group experienced a decrease in BMI after the application of TTM. The Mann Whitney test results indicate that there is a difference in the BMI pre-post intervention with the value of p=0.00 (> 0.05). CONCLUSION: The overweight and obese children's BMI was inluenced by TTM approach."

L-Tyrosine is considered safe for all animal species, provided that the conditions of use are respected, i.e. supplementation of conventional diets with 0.5 \% L-tyrosine for food-producing animals and 1.5 \% for non-food-producing species. Higher dietary concentrations may lead to growth rate depression and eye lesions, and, in young animals, behavioural changes. L-Tyrosine will be incorporated into the body protein of the animal.

On the basis of the data available, no risk is expected for the consumer from the use of this L-tyrosine preparation showing a purity > 95 \%. In the absence of data, the product is considered potentially irritating to skin and eyes, a potential dermal sensitiser and hazardous by inhalation. The use of L-tyrosine in animal nutrition would not be expected to lead to any localised increase in the concentration of L-tyrosine or its metabolites in the environment. It is concluded that the use of this product as a feed additive does not represent a risk to the environment. The supplementation of feed with L-tyrosine is efficacious in cases where high requirements for tyrosine as a melanin precursor occur.

Trust in the food supply and those who regulate it is receiving greater acknowledgement because of the influence of trust on food choice. No prior investigation into pregnant women and food trust has been conducted. Aims This paper identifies factors that determine the nature and extent of pregnant women's trust in food; sources of information which influence pregnant women's food choices; and how trust impacts on pregnant women's food choices. Method In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 pregnant women; nine were pregnant with their first child and four were in their second or subsequent pregnancy. Results Food choices of pregnant women were predominantly influenced by nutrition and perceived quality of food. Risktaking behaviour, such as the consumption of foods considered high risk during pregnancy, was common amongst participants. The sample was characterised by a dependence on expert information, limited reflexivity in relation to food safety, and contradictory practice such as risk-taking behaviours in regard to high risk foods were observed. Conclusion Further research is needed to confirm findings in this study. Research into consumption of high-risk foods and the information received from healthcare providers would be useful in creating a clearer understanding of whether provision of information is sufficient in communicating risks and promoting a healthy pregnancy."

This paper provides examples of such developments, analyzes their contribution to the expansion of human capabilities and, consequently, implications for the future working environment. It addresses ethical issues and risks associated with human enhancement technologies, in particular, the emergence of the new social divide - between the users of such technologies and people lacking access to them. Finally, it discusses some wild cards that may cause future surprises and shocks, i.e. machines that can control a human-excluded world, a virtual level of human life that dominates real life. The author notes that such conditions will require rethinking established views of personality, human responsibility and mutual obligations that will help the establishment of new behavioral patterns."

The girls aged 14-18 years old constitute the risk group for anorexia nervosa with the tendency to affect even the younger girls. Eating disorders are characterized by body dissatisfaction related to the overvaluation of the thin body ideal associated with dysfunctional patterns of cognition and weight control behaviours that results in significant medical, psychological and social complication. The important factor for initiating the onset of eating disorders is dysfunctional family background: controlling and with high expectations and demands mother and the certain personality traits of the adolescent such as low esteem, high ambition, perfectionism, perseverance, determination. The first symptoms of anorexia nervosa are often unnoticeable. They began with gradual elimination of the chosen food products e.g. sweets, bread, meat and introduction of ``healthy{''} or ``fit{''} eating patterns to the daily diet routine. During the initial phase of the disease the food restriction plays the corroborant role giving the anorectic patient the feeling of full control, satisfaction and even sense of the success. Patient with bulimia nervosa are often undiagnosed because there is no spectacular and evident reduction of the body mass. The half of the patients with anorexia demonstrate the suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts. The majority of them shows the self-destructive behaviours. The treatment of eating disorders comprise the permanent and complex psychiatric therapy including the individual and family psychotherapy together with nutritional treatment. There is clear correlation between the duration of the disorder and the prognosis. The earlier diagnose is established, the better prognosis for the effective treatment is achieved."

W. and Matthews, Stephen G.","WORLD JOURNAL OF DIABETES","1948-9358","2","","211-216","2011","","10.4239/wjd.v2.i12.211","The discovery that small size at birth and during infancy are associated with a higher risk of diabetes and related metabolic disease in later life has pointed to the importance of developmental factors in these conditions. The birth size associations are thought to reflect exposure to adverse environmental factors during early development but the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. Animal and human work has pointed to the importance of changes in the set-point of a number of key hormonal systems controlling growth and development. These include the IGF-1/GH axis, gonadal hormones and, in particular, the systems mediating the classical stress response. Several studies show that small size at birth is linked with increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathoadrenal system in adult life. More recent human studies have shown associations between specific adverse experiences during pregnancy, such as famine or the consumption of adverse diets, and enhanced stress responses many decades later. The mediators of these neuroendocrine responses are biologically potent and are likely to have a direct influence on the risk of metabolic disease. These neuroendocrine changes may also have an evolutionary basis being part of broader process, termed phenotypic plasticity, by which adverse environmental cues experienced during development modify the structure and physiology of the adult towards a phenotype adapted for adversity. The changes are clearly advantageous if they lead to a phenotype which is well-adapted for the adult environment, but may lead to disease if there is subsequent overnutrition or other unexpected environmental conditions."

Preimplantation embryos sense and adapt to their environment either in vivo, dependent upon maternal nutrition and lifestyle, or in response to in vitro culture. Embryonic responses are beneficial in the short term to ensure survival and optimal developmental progression, yet increase the risk of ill health later in life through to adulthood. Learning objectives: To be aware that maternal nutrition or in vitro environment influence embryonic development, gene expression and metabolism. To acknowledge mechanisms by which the preimplantation embryo can sense and react to the environment in which it develops. To understand the concept that developmental plasticity is advantageous to maximise survival chances at an increased risk of later disease, should prevailing conditions change. Ethical issues: Can we blame our parents for ill health in the next generation? How can effective interventions to suppress disease risk be developed and tested?"

Obesity is strongly associated with the comorbidities of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease and represents an enormous burden to health care systems. Of even more concern is the increase of around 40\% in the prevalence of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes over the last 20 years. Metabolic disease results from complex interactions of many factors, including genetic, physiologic, behavioral, and environmental influences. The recent rate at which these diseases have increased suggests that environmental, eg, epigenetic, and behavioral influences, rather than genetic causes, are fuelling the present epidemic. In this context, the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis has highlighted the link between periconceptual, fetal, and early infant phases of life and the subsequent development of adult obesity and related metabolic disorders. Both maternal undernutrition (global and targeted) and maternal obesity elicit an obese offspring phenotype. This review will examine the role of altered maternal nutrition on obesity risk in offspring, the interactions with the postnatal nutritional environment, the possible strategies for intervention, and the role of epigenetics in the disease process."

There is growing interest in strategies to modify the environment in midlife to increase the probability of maintaining cognitive health in late life. Several potentially modifiable risk factors have been studied in relation to cognitive impairment and dementia in late life, but methodological limitations of observational research have resulted in some inconsistencies across studies. The most promising strategies are maintaining cardiovascular health, engaging in mental, physical, and social activities, using alcohol in moderation, abstaining from tobacco use, and following a heart-healthy diet. Other factors that may influence cognitive health are occupational attainment, depression, personality, exposure to general anes-thesia, head injury, postmenopausal hormone therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and nutritional supplements such as antioxidants. Some long-term observational studies initiated in midlife or earlier, and some randomized controlled trials, have examined the effects of specific cognitive health promotion behaviors in midlife on the risk of cognitive impairment in late life. Overall, these studies provide limited support for risk reduction at this time. Recommendations and challenges for developing effective strategies to reduce the burden of cognitive impairment and dementia in the future are discussed."

BPD causes serious distress and impairment in social, occupational and role functioning, and it is associated with high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicide. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) treatment guidelines indicate the use of pharmacotherapy to manage state symptoms during periods of acute exacerbations and trait vulnerability, while psychotherapy is required to attain lasting improvements in patients' personality and overall functioning. Three symptom dimensions are the main targets for pharmacotherapy of borderline personality disorder: affective dysregulation, impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol and cognitive-perceptual symptoms. APA guidelines recommend choosing antidepressant agents, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and mood stabilizers to treat affective dysregulation and impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol; low-dose antipsychotics are suggested for cognitive-perceptual symptoms. Two psychotherapeutic approaches have been shown in randomized controlled trials to be efficacious, i.e., psychodynamic therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Cognitive, interpersonal, and support psychotherapies have also been considered. Objective This review aims to report and discuss data from clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses concerning efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in the treatment of borderline personality disorder ( Tables I, II). Methods Clinical trials, reviews and meta-analyses of antidepressants in patients with borderline personality disorder were identified through careful searches in MedLine and other sources. Results Investigations that considered controlled trials of antidepressant agents mainly focused on SSRIs. These drugs, mainly fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, are indicated as firstline treatments for affective instability (depression, anxiety, and outbursts of anger) and impulsive dyscontrol (impulsive aggression, self-mutilation, and self-damaging behaviors). SSRIs present lower incidence and milder severity of adverse effects than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and MAOIs. Risk of toxicity is also lower. Available controlled studies indicate that MAOIs can be useful in treating borderline personality disorder with main effects on symptoms of atypical depression, anger and impulsivity, but the risk of adverse effects and the difficulties with adherence to required dietary restrictions constitute limitations to their use in clinical practice. TCAs are second-choice drugs in treatment of BPD; these agents can produce effects on mood instability and irritability control, but available results are limited. Clinical experience suggests that TCAs may sometimes be indicated for patients with comorbid severe depressive disorders. However, their risk for toxicity and potential lethality in overdose support the preferential use of SSRIs or related antidepressants. Although more clinical trials are needed, initial data concerning reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and noradrenaline (SNRIs) (duloxetine and venlafaxine) are promising. These antidepressants have been found to be efficacious in reducing impulsivity, anger, affective instability, anxiety, and suicidality. Conclusions Many antidepressive agents with different mechanism of actions have been evaluated in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder. However, a part of available studies suffer from serious methodological limitations. Further controlled trials vs. placebo or active agents are required, including larger samples and using longer durations of treatments, in order to confirm current indications for pharmacotherapy of patients with BPD."

Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a non-probability quota sample of 660 respondents to explore the attitudes and behaviour of Greek consumers towards organic food products. Findings - Greek consumers seem to be informed about environmental and health issues. They seek information about the nutritional value of food and demand more products free from chemical residues. The results show that most consumers associate organic consumption mainly with fruit and vegetables. Although demographics seem to affect attitudes towards organics, their value in explaining actual behaviour is minimal. Research limitations/implications - It is recognized that the data gathered in this study focus on the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, Greece. The specific area though, is considered to be representative of the total Greek population. The results confirm that health, concern for the environment, animal welfare and support of the local economy are drivers of organic consumption. However, there is an indication that the importance of motives and barriers may vary for different product categories and perhaps future research should focus on product segmentation. Practical implications - Although certain similarities in consumers' attitudes towards organic food products have been identified, this paper records the variation in behaviour towards organics among the various consumer groups examined in Greece, and highlights the gap between attitudes and actual behaviour. Given the complexity of consumer decision making, future research should explore the other value trade-offs that consumers make. Originality/value - This paper attempts to provide evidence on the relatively under researched area of organics attitudes and behaviour in Greece."

M.","PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA","1841-5377","4","","25-38","2008","",NA,"Short literature, the diaries and the memories of those who suffered during the popular democracy, but also the numerous public articles and debates after 1989 made us familiar, at least as witnesses, with the idea of prison and with the prison reality. The prison, which influenced the destiny of so many persons (from political personalities or intellectuals of some notoriety, to common individuals), becomes not only a natural component of every day life, but also a valuable element of it. Thus, paradoxically, the prison appears as a special place which filters the people's morality and character. Prison has always been a place of abuses, but never these abuses reached such intensity as during the totalitarian dictatorships, when it became a means of annihilation, of repression and besides all, of destruction. This prison invasion in everyday life has totally changed a situation which was considerably different before XXth century and that literature kept at a low level. The memories of the former anti-communists prisoners can be classified, at the existential level, from two points of view: as a physical fight and resistance proof and as inner endurance. The first is epically organized as an adventure novel, while the second is, mostly, a confession text. The Romanian prisoner oscillates between Don Quijote and Iov. These Quixotic forms are nothing but a hectic search of the human, a supreme exercise of the free agency. On the other side, the main form of existence in prison is not action, but reflection. The prisoner doesn't prove less courage, he is not a timorous person; on the contrary, he lives a real euphoria of accomplishment in endeavor and he is able to face the guardians, to make demonstrative actions, risking in this way very rough punishments. But he doesn't ``realize{''} himself as a prisoner and regime enemy by this attitude, but in the way he assimilates intellectually and morally the unique experience that he lived, turning it into a stage towards self-fulfillment. The memories from the prison show something more (and in this point they touch the literary side): that suffering, humiliation, fear, starvation, coldness and torture awake the latency of unconcealed predispositions, of an aptitude for literature (even if many of the writings don't have a special aesthetic value). From this point of view, the testimonies of the political prisoners from behind the bars during the ``madding Stalinism{''} produce a new literary and human matter which changes, mostly, the data of the Romanian literature: by discovering the secrets and tortures of the Hell, literature can't be any longer as before."

Overweight and obesity are widespread and go hand in hand with an increased health risk. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial based on gene/environment interactions; hyperalimentation and physical inactivity, as an expression of the rapid technical advancements within the past decades, have, however, had a decisive influence on the pandemic spreading of obesity. The prevalence of mental disorders is increased particularly in obese women. Although phylogenetically of relevance, an environment that associates slimness with beauty health, physical and mental proficiency leads to a stigmatization of the obese. The results are mental symptoms and disorders. On the contrary, mental problems up to and including the full clinical picture of mental disorders may lead to changes in eating and exercise behaviour, the result of which may be a sustained positive energy balance with overweight and obesity. The success of conservative weight reduction measures in obesity is inadequate. Surgical measures are more successful, but they are only indicated for severe obesity. The psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic approach to over-weight and obesity is multifactorial and indispensable. Obesity is not an eating disorder; it may, however, be the result of hyperalimentation into which pathogenetic and mental factors have been incorporated."

EFSA has therefore been required to provide a Scientific Opinion on several aspects of this, one concerning fattening pigs. The opinion should include: the effects of stocking density, including group size and grouping methods, space requirements and the impact of stall design and different flooring types taking into account different climatic conditions. The Scientific Opinion was adopted by the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) on 6 September 2007. Based on the scientific data presented in the Scientific Report and risk assessment, conclusions and recommendations were drawn. In relation to disease, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and production-related diseases can have a major impact on the welfare of fattening pigs. Management, inspection and other disease prevention measures, handling, hygiene, floor type and the manure system have major effects on disease risk and significant importance for ensuring good welfare. At post-mortem slaughter inspection, pigs kept outdoors usually have a lower prevalence of lesions due to respiratory infections than indoor pigs but higher risk of some internal parasites. Leg disorders, which are caused by a complex of factors including genetic selection and high energy and high protein diet, are a major problem. Interactions between many aspects of the biological functioning of pigs and effects of housing and management on welfare are described. Without suitable rooting and manipulation materials, pigs are likely to direct tactile behaviour towards companions using aggression or other causes of poor welfare. Manipulable material makes any floor more attractive for exploration and pigs prefer the presence of straw to an unbedded floor. The provision of appropriate foraging material is difficult in pens with fully slatted floors unless there is automatic shredding in the waste disposal system. If the ambient temperatures are too high, adequate space to separate from other pigs, sufficient contact with a cool floor, access to outdoors, air-flow rates to help evaporation, water on the skin, or more drinking water help to avoid over-heating. In the case of too low a temperature, better insulation of the floor lowers the risk of hypothermia. When there is too little sensory input, because of social isolation, a barren environment or too little light intensity, pigs are likely to show abnormal behavioural and physiological responses. Flashing lights can be disturbing to pigs and poor welfare is also associated with light of a wavelength or intensity that does not allow the pig to discriminate the behaviour of other pigs or materials. The genetic selection for rapid growth and lean meat without enough consideration of other factors has led to some widespread and serious problems. However, selective breeding to eliminate the halothane gene has improved pig welfare. Poor quality pen design can cause poor welfare in pigs because of parts that cause injury, or disturbance and aggression. If pigs do not have sufficient exercise, there can be adverse effects on bone and muscle development. Dunging behaviour (urination and defecation) is facilitated by design of the housing system and good management. Mixing unacquainted pigs leads to a substantial risk of fighting, injury and production loss. Recommendations presented in the Scientific Opinion include the need to provide an environment and management so that the negative consequences of poor welfare such as injurious behaviours, physiological problems and immunosuppression, caused in barren environments, are avoided. In this sense, it is recommended that pigs should be provided with manipulable, destructible materials, wallows, lighting of appropriate wavelength and intensity, water of a quality and quantity sufficient for their needs, and a balanced diet with no harmful contaminants. In order to minimise disease in pigs, and hence poor welfare, effective disease preventive and management procedures should be in place. The design of accommodation for pigs should be such that the pigs have sufficient exercise for normal bone and muscle development. There should be further efforts to select and breed so that problems of pig welfare, including cardiovascular malfunction, risk of early death and leg disorders are maintained at a low level. The recommendations for further research are mainly focused on the evaluation of the effects of the exposure to several factors (i.e. barren environment, light intensity, noise, respiratory disorders) on the welfare of fattening pigs.

Because weight gain increases diabetes risk, and even modest weight reduction reduces risk, weight management is paramount in lessening the occurrence and effects of diabetes. Weight loss interventions should include patient education, behavioral strategies, physical activity, energy intake deficits of 500 to 1000 kcal/day, and prevention of recidivism. Macronutrient distribution ranges of diets for diabetic patients follow those of the Dietary Reference Intakes, allowing for individualization according to a patient's metabolic responses, needs, and preferences. Nutrients to be limited include saturated fats, artificial trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, whereas nutrients to be emphasized include monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, fibers, antioxidants, and minerals, including potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chromium. Food sources are advised rather than supplements. Sugars can be isocalorically substituted for starches without detriments to glycemic control. Diets with low glycemic index or load may have modest benefits in managing type 2 diabetes. If a diabetic patient chooses to consume alcohol, he or she should do so in moderation. Foods advocated in type 2 diabetes are similar to those that are also beneficial in reducing risk for other chronic diseases."

In order to tackle this, an enhanced appreciation of what drives some consumers to overeat is required. It is clear that several features of the modern environment encourage over-consumption in many people, at least some of the time. However, there is variation in the extent to which this translates into weight gain. Understanding whether susceptibility is dispositional or learned will shape prevention and treatment programmes. This review identifies situational cues that promote overeating and dispositional traits, such as impulsivity and sensitivity to reward, which make some individuals specifically vulnerable to overeating. These traits are likely to contribute to the development of the obese state, but also present barriers to weight management. Personalised nutrition and behavioural strategies may provide a novel and innovative approach, as these take account of individual differences in vulnerability to overeating."

The insulin gene and variation in the insulin gene variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism has been suggested to modify birth size and diabetes susceptibility. Materials and Methods: We assessed the association between the insulin gene VNTR genotypes, early growth and glucose and insulin metabolism in adult life in 488 subjects participating in the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Results: Body size at birth did not differ significantly between the INS VNTR genotypes. One additional type III allele was associated with a 13 g decrease (95\% CI -55 to 81 g; p=0.7) in birth weight. Fasting glucose concentration was highest in the carriers of the III/III genotype. The cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes did not differ between the genotypes. Interactions between birth size and insulin VNTR genotype in relation to fasting glucose (p for interaction =0.08 for birth weight, p=0.05 for birth length) and 2-hour insulin (p for interaction =0.04) were ob-served. Conclusions: These interactions between body size at birth and genotype reflect interactions between the insulin VNTR gene and the intrauterine environment. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of developmental plasticity, where one genotype can give rise to different phenotypes dependent on the early environment."

Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 9 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6-7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses in Southern Europe as an insecticide and acaricide as proposed by the applicant with application via orchard air blast sprayers and tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers. Application is made to apples and pears with a maximum total dose of 2.7 kg diazinon per hectare and to sugar beet with a maximum total dose of 0.72 kg diazinon per hectare. It should be noted that the use in apples and pears were withdrawn during the EU peer review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Diazol 60 EC, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. However, it should be noted that full validation of the method of analysis for food commodities is not available as no independent laboratory validation data are available. As well as this further validation data are required for the method of analysis for air. Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding data gaps for the relevant impurities. Acute toxicity during oral exposure is higher than by dermal application or inhalation. Therefore the proposed classification is Xn; R22 ``Harmful if swallowed{''}. The main effect observed during short term or long term exposure is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. Based on this, the relevant oral short term NOAEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day in the dog studies. There is no genotoxic potential for diazinon, no carcinogenic effect in rats and mice, and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits. No delayed neurotoxicity was observed in hens, and the NOAEL in the subchronic neurotoxicity study with rats is the same as the short term NOAEL, based on acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. The groundwater metabolites G 27550(3) and GS 31144(4) are not considered toxicologically significant, having no phosphate group susceptible to produce acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. They were concluded not relevant. The three impurities TEPP5, O, S-TEP6 and S, S-TEPP7 were very toxic in acute oral studies and considered of toxicological concern. Acute and subchronic human studies were submitted, but were either not acceptable, or had scientific deficiencies. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.025 mg/kg bw, with the use of the safety factor 100. For the supported use on sugar beets, the estimated operator exposure according to the German or the UK models is largely above the AOEL, with or without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2700\% of the AOEL with the use of PPE and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) according to the German model). The metabolism of diazinon in plants is clearly elucidated. The degradation pathway proceeds first through hydrolysis of the phosphorothioate ester link, leading to metabolite G 27550, which given its chemical structure has no cholinesterase activity. This compound is further hydroxylated and conjugated to glucose. Diazoxon is not observed. The amount of metabolites in comparison to the parent level is variable from crop to crop, but the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound only for monitoring and risk assessment as no other compound expected to add a contribution to the toxicological effects of diazinon was identified. Supervised residue trials were conducted suggesting the setting of a MRL at 0.5 mg/kg in pome fruits, and indicating that residues in sugar beet roots are below 0.01 mg/kg. No residues are expected in following crops and no plant- back restriction is needed. Processing of apples leads to a clear reduction of the diazinon levels in juice and sauce. However, the formation of a degradation product (desethyl diazinon), identified under specific hydrolysis conditions, was not investigated in practical conditions. This compound is recommended for inclusion in the residue definition for risk assessment in processed commodities. The metabolism of diazinon in livestock has been investigated and parent compound was found to be the major compound of toxicological relevance in animal tissues. Diazinon exhibits a lipophilic behaviour. Two metabolites, diazoxon and a hydroxylated form of diazinon were also present. The residue definition in animal commodities can be restricted to diazinon on the basis of the representative uses considered in this peer-review, leading to a low livestock dietary exposure and non significant transfer of residues to animal tissues, as demonstrated by feeding studies. The short and long term exposure assessments were conducted and indicated potential exceedences of the ADI and ARfD, which in some cases appear to be severe, in particular for infants and toddlers, with high consumption levels of pome fruits. In soil diazinon exhibited low to moderate persistence. Significant sinks for the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used in the aerobic laboratory studies were residue not extracted by acetonitrile: water or methanol/water (9-38\% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 76-119 days) and mineralisation to CO2 5.8-86\% AR at 76-119 days. The major (>10\% AR) metabolite in soil extracts was G 27550 accounting for up to 82\% AR which exhibited high soil persistence. This metabolite may have the potential to accumulate in soil if applications are made to the same field in successive years. Diazinon exhibited medium to low soil mobility and G 27550 exhibited very high mobility based on the results of guideline batch laboratory adsorption experiments. The minor soil degradation product (max. 4.7\% AR) GS 31144 was also characterised as exhibiting very high soil mobility on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) computer modelling. In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments, diazinon exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 3.9-4.7 days) as a consequence of a combination of partitioning to sediment (accounting for up to 77\%AR at 0 days) and biodegradation. In the water phase the metabolite G 27550 accounted for a maximum of 47\%AR 30 days after application, levels subsequently declined (DT50 in water estimated at 87 days). G 27550 was also present in sediment (maximum 22.7\%AR). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile and acetonitrile: water represented 22-49\%AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation to CO2 of the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for only 4.7-5.1 \% AR by 100 days. The available surface water exposure assessment just considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The potential exposure of surface water with parent diazinon and the soil metabolite G 27550 via the drainage and runoff routes of entry has not been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for diazinon and G 27550 from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, should diazinon be included in Annex 1. Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling is not available. This is required. Based on the available FOCUS PEARL modelling that utilised too favourable input parameters, annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil column >0.75 mu g/L are already indicated for G 27550. For GS 31144 these concentrations are indicated to be >0.1 mu g/L. Based on current information it cannot be excluded that these concentrations for GS 31144 may be shown by appropriate modelling to be >0.75 mu g/L. Non relevance assessments are therefore required for both these potential groundwater contaminants. A significant dissipation route of diazinon from plants and soil will be volatilisation to the atmosphere. However calculated relatively rapid photooxidation through reaction with the hydroxyl radicals present in the upper atmosphere, indicate that diazinon is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport. A high acute, short and long term risk for insectivorous birds was identified in the first tier assessment for both evaluated uses. Based on actual measured concentrations of diazinon and degradation of residues in orchards the short and long term risk in apples/pears is considered low. However, the high acute risk remains. For sugar beet no valid residue data are available to refine the assessment. A high long term risk to insectivorous mammals was identified in both sugar beet and orchards. A risk for secondary poisoning was identified for earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in orchards and for earthworm-eating mammals for the use in sugar beet. Diazinon is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Risk mitigation measures comparable to 30 m buffer zones are required in orchards, and to 5 m in sugar beet. The toxicity to bees is high. Sugar beet is however not attractive to bees and application in orchards is late in the season after flowering. The risk to bees is therefore considered to be low. Non-target arthropods outside the field would be affected from the treatment in orchards. A potential for recolonisation has been shown in an aged residue study. However, a prerequisite for recolonisation from off-field non-target arthropod populations is that off-field populations are not affected. Therefore the risk to off-field non-target arthropods needs to be further addressed for the use in orchards. The acute risk to earthworms from diazinon and the soil metabolites is low and long term studies are not considered necessary. However, the risk to earthworms and other soil macro-organisms from the more persistent metabolite G 27550 needs to be addressed for a full conclusion. The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low."

According to the mandate of EFSA, ethical, socio-economic, cultural and religious aspects are outside the scope of this opinion. Summary of the Scientific Opinion for each of the three parts of the Mandate from the Commission: 1. Summary of the need for protection for invertebrates and fetuses and the criteria used (Questions 1 \& 2) The Panel was asked to consider the scientific evidence for the sentience and capacity of all invertebrate species used for experimental purposes and of fetal and embryonic forms to ``experience pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm{''}. Indicators of an animal's capacity to experience suffering include long-term memory, plasticity of behaviour, complex learning and the possibility of experiencing pain. Some invertebrate species: (i) possess short and long term memory, (ii) exhibit complex learning such as social learning, conditioned suppression, discrimination and generalisation, reversal learning, (iii) show spatial awareness and form cognitive maps, (iv) show deception, (v) perform appropriately in operant studies to gain reinforcement or avoid punishment, (vi) possess receptors sensitive to noxious stimuli connected by nervous pathways to a central nervous system and brain centres, (vii) possess receptors for opioid substances, (viii) modify their responses to stimuli that would be painful for a human after having had analgesics, (ix) respond to stimuli that would be painful for a human in a manner so as to avoid or minimise damage to the body, (x) show an unwillingness to resubmit themselves to a painful procedure indicating that they can learn to associate apparently non-painful with apparently painful events. At a certain stage of development within an egg or the mother, the characteristics listed above may appear. Such information has been used in coming to conclusions about sentience. Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfish) have a pain system similar to that of other fish and brains that do not differ much from those of some other fish. There is evidence that cephalopods have adrenal and pain systems, a relatively complex brain similar to many vertebrates, significant cognitive ability including good learning ability and memory retention especially in octopuses, individual temperaments, elaborate signalling and communication systems, especially in cuttlefish and squid that can show rapid emotional colour changes, may live in social groups and have complex social relationships. Nautiloids have many characters similar to those of other cephalopods, they can track other individuals, live for a long time and are active pelagic animals. The largest of decapod crustaceans are complex in behaviour and appear to have some degree of awareness. They have a pain system and considerable learning ability. As a consequence of this evidence, it is concluded that cyclostomes, all Cephalopoda and decapod crustaceans fall into the same category of animals as those that are at present protected. Using similar arguments, the dramatic evidence of the sensory processing, analytical and prediction ability of salticid spiders provides evidence for awareness greater than in any other invertebrates except cephalopods but we have little evidence of a pain system so do not at present put these spiders in that same category. Free-swimming tunicates are also in this borderline area and social insects and amphioxus are close to it. Whenever there is a significant risk that a mammalian fetus, or the fetus or embryo of an oviparous animal such as a bird, reptile, amphibian, fish or cephalopod, is for any length of time sufficiently aware that it will suffer or otherwise have poor welfare when a procedure is carried out on it within the uterus or egg, or after removal therefrom, such animals should be included in the list of protected animals. The stage of development at which this risk is sufficient for protection to be necessary is that at which the normal locomotion and sensory functioning of an individual independent of the egg or mother can occur. For air-breathing animals this time will not generally be later than that at which the fetus could survive unassisted outside the uterus or egg. For most vertebrate animals, the stage of development at which there is a risk of poor welfare when a procedure is carried out on them is the beginning of the last third of development within the egg or mother. For a fish, amphibian, cephalopod, or decapod it is when it is capable of feeding independently rather than being dependent on the food supply from the egg. Precocial oviparous species, some of which are breathing at the time of hatching present much evidence of being aware before hatching and during the last days before hatching, Even though the mammalian fetus can show physical responses to external stimuli, in some species perhaps for as much as the last third of their development, the weight of present evidence suggests that consciousness is inhibited in the fetus until it starts to breathe air. It is possible that in a mammalian fetus there might be transient episodes of increased oxygenation above the threshold required to support some aspects of consciousness. It is clear that there is a risk, perhaps a small risk, that any mammalian fetus may on occasion be affected by some experimental procedures in such a way that their welfare is poor, sometimes because they are suffering pain. If a mammalian fetus is removed from the mother and starts to breathe, its level of awareness will change to that typical of such animals after parturition. In addition, protection may need to be given against emotional states in pregnant mothers to safeguard subsequent behavioural modification and welfare of the offspring. When a procedure is performed on a fetus that is likely to produce pain in the newborn or newly-hatched of that species, adequate anaesthesia and analgesia should be given provided that the agents used do not significantly increase the likelihood of fetal mortality. In the circumstance where no suitable anaesthetic or analgesic agents are available, procedures should not be carried out on such fetuses. When the procedure might cause a lasting inflammatory response that persists post-natally, protection should be given against pain and suffering. A schedule of anaesthetics and analgesics that are suitable for use in pregnant animals, and fetuses should be prepared. 2. Summary of the need for purpose breeding of animals and the criteria used (Question 3) Species listed in Annex I to Directive 86/609/EEC are those that must be `purpose bred' when used in experiments (unless a specific exemption has been obtained). The criteria for inclusion of species in Annex I have not been clearly defined and hence no information is available on why they were originally included. Therefore, the Commission has asked the EFSA to issue a scientific opinion on the scientific criteria that could be used to determine in which cases animals to be used in experiments should be purpose-bred and, based on these criteria, determine which species currently used in experiments meet these criteria. It is the opinion of the AHAW panel that including a species as ``purpose-bred{''} within Annex I will confer a considerable degree of assurance that animals of that species will be provided with suitable accommodation, welfare and care practices. As a consequence of health and colony management within breeding establishments, there can be improved confidence in the quality of the animal, resulting in improved science and a reduction in animal numbers required. Taking these factors in isolation, for the great majority of scientific investigations, there would be welfare and scientific merit in recommending that all animals used in scientific procedures be purpose-bred. However, before making such a recommendation, there are a number of other important factors that have to be considered. The consequences of inclusion of all species could, for example, result in loss of genetic diversity, the generation of large numbers of surplus animals and significant delays in scientific progress. A risk assessment approach has therefore been taken to this issue, with the group analysing the potential benefits for and the adverse consequences of the inclusion of each species in Annex I. Two issues have been considered: animal welfare and scientific quality. For each, three steps have been followed: identification of the hazards, exposure assessment and consequence assessment. The criteria suggested by the Technical Expert Working Group (TEWG) organised by DG ENV (2003) have been considered and incorporated into an assessment process against which the inclusion of each of the commonly used laboratory species was reviewed. The criteria considered by the AHAW panel have been whether legislation already exists to protect animal welfare, genetically altered animals, health and genetic quality of animals, demand, extrapolation of results to farming or to wild populations and capture from the wild. It is recommended that, wherever possible, animals used should be of a uniform standard so that there is good and effective control over the animals' genetic fidelity, microbial status, nutrition, socialisation to humans and other animals (e.g. ferrets, dogs and even rodents) and environment. Ideally all animals should be purpose bred but, in practice, some exceptions will be necessary. Exceptions should be made to purpose breeding when it is necessary for the research that a particular strain or breed is used, or that scientific progress would be unduly delayed providing that the scientific data resulting from such research were considered likely to be of good quality, i.e. the competent authorities should consider the potential adverse consequences for research should an exemption for the use of non-purpose bred animals be refused (86/609/EEC: Article 19(4)). Genetically altered animals (of all species) should be added to Annex I. The review of all the commonly used laboratory species has concluded that with the exception of quail (Coturnix coturnix) all the other species listed should continue to be purpose-bred and some further species should be added, namely: Chinese hamster (Cricetus griseus), Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), two Xenopus species (X. laevis and X. tropicalis) and two species of Rana (R. temporaria and R. pipiens). 3. Summary of humane methods of killing animals (Question 4) Nearly all animals are killed at the end of a research project and it is important that this is done humanely i.e. causing as little suffering as possible for the animals concerned. The majority (85-90\%) of animals used in research are small rodents however, of necessity (as we are trying to cover all methods for all animals), much of the Report deals with the methods for large animals. The Opinion of the scientific panel on AHAW is based on the Report annexed to this Opinion that presented recent data building on the three earlier authoritative reports on the humane killing of animals i.e.: 1) the Scientific Report related to welfare aspects of animal stunning and killing methods of the main commercial species of animals (EFSA, 2004, http://www.efsa.eu.int); 2) Close et al. 1996/1997 (endorsed by the EU for the humane killing of laboratory animals); and 3) the AVMA Report (2000) dealing with methods for all animals. The Opinion does not repeat what is already dealt with in detail in those reports but we have included a section dealing with new data for each method where applicable, and some conclusions and recommendations are retained. The Scientific Report and Opinion deal with the various technical ways of killing animals starting with electrical and mechanical methods, followed by gaseous and then injectable methods. The section on the use of gaseous agents is in some considerable detail as it is the subject of much new data, with more than 20 new papers in the past 10 years, many of them dealing with the commonest laboratory animals. The interpretation of this data has been varied. The recommended methods for each species are given in Tables 1 to 8 at the end of this section but, in general, we have adopted the recommendations given in the existing EU Guidance (Close et al., 1996/97) except where stated. The AHAW panel suggested that these methods could be varied but only with a scientific justification and appropriate authority, i.e. the recommended methods represent the default position. We also address more general issues including ensuring death, training of personnel, killing animals for their tissues and oversight, the choice of method and when this might affect the scientific outcomes, and gathering information on methods used as well as their efficiency and effectiveness."
