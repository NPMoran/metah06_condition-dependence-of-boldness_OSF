Abstract = {{There is growing international interest in how environmental conditions
   experienced during development can shape adult phenotypes and the extent
   to which such induced changes are adaptive. One physiological system
   that links an individual to changes in environmental circumstances
   during development is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mammalian
   studies have linked early postnatal stress to later changes in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the physiological link
   {[}lactational corticosterone (CORT) transfer] between mother and
   offspring during postnatal development constrains the ability to
   determine the direct effects of such stressors on subsequent physiology
   and behavior. Here we present a novel model using an avian species, the
   zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), in which maternal hormonal transfer
   during postnatal development is likely to be absent. Postnatal exposure
   of chicks to the stress hormone CORT was manipulated for a 16-d period
   up until nutritional independence (28 d), and the long-term effects on
   the physiological response to stress determined. CORT doses were scaled
   to mimic the physiological response of juvenile birds to a
   capture-handling-restraint protocol. CORT-fed birds showed exaggerated
   and prolonged responses to acute stress at 60d of age. Our results
   clearly demonstrate that postnatal stress has significant long-term
   effects on the physiological stress response in birds and provides a
   potential mechanism underlying long-term behavioural responses to
   developmental conditions. This study represents the first direct
   evidence for postnatal glucocorticoid programming of the stress response
   using this novel model for postnatal stress. This model therefore
   provides an important tool with which to investigate the role of
   glucocorticoids in shaping adult phenotypes. (Endocrinology 150:

Abstract = {{The use of hormonal contraception is commonly associated with weight

   association between the use of hormonal contraception and weight change

   Data were gathered from the charts of 259 adolescent female patients
   seen in an outpatient adolescent clinic for up to 72 months. At the
   initial visit, all patients were evaluated for risk-taking behavior and
   received preventive counseling. Patients were categorized as either
   contraception users or non-users (control group). Contraception users
   were subdivided into Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) user group
   or non-DMPA contraception user group. The latter group included patients
   using oral contraceptive pills, transdermal contraceptive patch,
   intravaginal contraceptive ring, or other forms of hormonal
   contraception. Following the initial visit, all contraception users
   (DMPA and non-DMPA) visited the clinic every three- or six-months for
   follow-up. During the follow-up visits, patient weight was recorded and
   the patient received Counseling services by a physician, a licensed
   psychologist, and/or a nutritionist as deemed appropriate. Data were
   entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Statistical Analysis
   Software. The results showed no significant difference in weight gain
   between groups. We hypothesize that hormonal contraception in adolescent
   patients, coupled with clinical intervention in form of counseling and
   regular monitoring, over an extended period (longer than 24 rnonths) is
   not associated with significant weight gain.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
   are a major pest of vine, Vitis vinifera. As larvae have limited energy
   reserves and are in danger of desiccation and predation an efficient
   response to plant volatiles that would guide them to food and shelter
   could be expected. The responses of starved 2nd or 3rd instar larvae to
   volatile emissions from their artificial diet and to single host plant
   volatiles were recorded on a locomotion compensator. Test products were
   added to an air stream passing over the 30 cm diameter servosphere. The
   larvae showed non-directed walks of low rectitude in the air stream
   alone but changed to goal-oriented upwind displacement characterised by
   relatively straight tracks when the odour of the artificial diet and
   vapours of methyl salicylate, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol,
   terpinen-4-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and
   (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were added to the air stream. This
   chemoanemotactic targeted displacement illustrates appetence for certain
   volatile cues from food by starved Lobesia larvae. Analysis of the
   larval behaviour indicates dose dependent responses to some of the host
   plant volatiles tested with a response to methyl salicylate already
   visible at 1 ng, the lowest source dose tested. These behavioural
   responses show that Lobesia larvae can efficiently locate mixtures of
   volatile products released by food sources as well as single volatile
   constituents of their host plants. Such goal-oriented responses with
   shorter travel time and reduced energy loss are probably of importance
   for larval survival as it decreases the time they are exposed to biotic
   and abiotic hazards. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect predator-induced effects on growth, morphology and reproduction
   have been extensively studied in marine invertebrates but usually
   without consideration of size-specific effects and not at all in
   post-metamorphic echinoids. Urchins are an unusually good system, in
   which, to study size effects because individuals of various ages within
   one species span four orders of magnitude in weight while retaining a
   nearly isometric morphology. We tracked growth of urchins,
   Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (0.013-161.385 g), in the presence or
   absence of waterborne cues from predatory Jonah crabs, Cancer borealis.
   We ran experiments at ambient temperatures, once for 4 weeks during
   summer and again, with a second set of urchins, for 22 weeks over
   winter. We used a scaled, cube-root transformation of weight for
   measuring size more precisely and for equalizing variance across sizes.
   Growth rate of the smallest urchins (summer: < 17 mm diameter; winter: <
   7 mm diameter) decreased by 40-42\% in response to crab cues. In
   contrast, growth rate of larger urchins was unaffected in the summer and
   increased in response to crab scent by 7\% in the winter. At the end of
   the 22-week experiment, additional gonadal and skeletal variables were
   measured. Cue-exposed urchins developed heavier, thicker skeletons and
   smaller gonads, but no differences in spine length or jaw size. The
   differences depended on urchin size, suggesting that there are
   size-specific shifts in gonadal and somatic investment in urchins.}},

Abstract = {{In vertebrates, stressors such as starvation or predator attacks
   stimulate the rapid elevation of circulating glucocorticoid hormones,
   triggering physiological and behavioral responses that aid immediate
   survival but simultaneously inhibit reproduction. This stress response
   has been proposed to serve as a physiological mediator of life-history
   trade-offs: when the value of current reproduction is high relative to
   the value of future reproduction and survival, a mitigated stress
   response is expected to enable successful breeding and maximize fitness.
   Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we investigated baseline and
   peak stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels during parental care in
   64 bird species. We found that (1) species with a higher value of the
   current brood relative to future breeding mounted weaker corticosterone
   responses during acute stress, and (2) females in species with more
   female-biased parental care had weaker corticosterone responses. These
   results support the brood value hypothesis, suggesting that the stress
   response evolves as an adaptive basis for life-history strategies.
   Further, we found that (3) baseline corticosterone correlated positively
   with brood value and negatively with body mass, and (4) peak
   corticosterone was greater in species breeding at higher latitudes. The
   latter findings suggest that circulating corticosterone concentrations
   might be matched to the anticipated demands and risks during nesting.}},

Abstract = {{The use of demand curves to derive estimates of motivational strength is
   a popular method for measuring animals' preferences for a range of
   different resources in applied animal behaviour research. In a typical
   experiment, an animal pays a gradually increasing cost (e.g. by pushing
   through a weighted door) in order to access a resource it wants or
   needs. The resulting demand curves are used to calculate several
   measures of the strength of the animal's motivation to access the
   resource. We tested two assumptions that underlie the majority of
   applications of this approach: first, that animals have a fixed energy
   budget to spend on access to resources: and second, that the effect of
   price on demand is not greatly influenced by the order or magnitude of
   the price changes. Sixteen European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were
   trained to push through weighted doors to gain access to one of two
   resources, either a tray of turf, or protective foliage cover. In the
   first stage of the experiment reservation prices were established for
   each bird by daily increasing the force necessary to open the door until
   the bird no longer accessed the resource. In the next stage, five
   different forces, chosen to evenly cover the range between free entry
   and each individual bird's reservation price, were presented in a random
   order under two levels of food availability. Overall, price was the most
   important determinant of demand. However, birds' demand for resources
   was increased by food rationing, suggesting that the cost of pushing the
   weighted doors might not have been energy. Birds' willingness to pay for
   a resource was also dependent upon the order in which the forces were
   presented, and specifically the contrast from the force presented the
   previous day. The results support the continued use of presenting costs
   on an ascending order to measure the demand in captive animals, but
   suggest that random order presentations can be used to check for order
   effects. We also suggest that the concept of a finite energy budget that
   animals have to spend on resources may not be useful in the measurement
   of captive animals' preferences and that a different approach might be
   needed. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety has been implicated in obesity and in the overconsumption of
   highly palatable foods such as those high in fat, sugar, or both. Also,
   the novelty-seeking trait has been associated with failure in
   weight-loss programs. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   associations of experimental anxiety and the self-administration of
   sucrose and high fat pellets in non-food deprived rats across different
   operant schedules. Male Wistar rats were subjected to the elevated
   plus-maze test (EPM) of anxiety-like behavior. The rats were tested for
   fixed ratio 5 (FR5) and progressive ratio (PR) operant responding for
   50\% sucrose, 95\% sucrose, and high-fat pellets. PR active lever press
   response for 95\% sucrose, but not the other pellet types, was
   correlated to \% time spent on open arms (P=0.019) in the EPM. On the
   FR5 schedule, activity (closed arm entries) was correlated to the
   self-administration of 50\% sucrose (P=0.027) and high-fat (P=0.002).
   This indicates an association of novelty-induced activity and
   self-administration of palatable food in sated rats, as well as a
   specific association of PR lever press response for 95\% sucrose and low
   anxiety-like behavior. It has been argued that such active lever press
   response on PR may be interpreted as craving for the reinforcer: thus,
   our findings indicate an inverse relationship of experimental anxiety
   and craving for sucrose. This connection may have implications for human
   situations, since anxiety and novelty-seeking have been associated with
   obesity and failure in weight-loss programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland

Title = {{Reducing stillbirths: behavioural and nutritional interventions before
   and during pregnancy}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The vast majority of global stillbirths occur in low-and
   middle-income countries, and in many settings, the majority of
   stillbirths occur antenatally, prior to the onset of labour. Poor
   nutritional status, lack of antenatal care and a number of behaviours
   increase women's risk of stillbirth in many resource-poor settings.
   Interventions to reduce these risks could reduce the resulting burden of
   stillbirths, but the evidence for the impact of such interventions has
   not yet been comprehensively evaluated.
   Methods: This second paper of a systematic review of interventions that
   could plausibly impact stillbirth rates covers 12 different
   interventions relating to behavioural and socially mediated risk
   factors, including exposures to harmful practices and substances,
   antenatal care utilisation and quality, and maternal nutrition before
   and during pregnancy. The search strategy reviewed indexed medical
   journals on PubMed and the Cochrane Library. If any eligible randomised
   controlled trials were identified that were published after the most
   recent Cochrane review, they were added to generate new meta-analyses.
   Interventions covered in this paper have a focus on low-and
   middle-income countries, both because of the large burden of stillbirths
   and because of the high prevalence of risk factors including maternal
   malnutrition and harmful environmental exposures in these countries. The
   reviews and studies belonging to these interventions were graded and
   conclusions derived about the evidence of benefit of these
   interventions.
   Results: From a programmatic perspective, none of the interventions
   achieved clear evidence of benefit. Evidence for some socially mediated
   risk factors were identified, such as exposure to indoor air pollution
   and birth spacing, but still require the development of appropriate
   interventions. There is a need for additional studies on culturally
   appropriate behavioural interventions and clinical trials to increase
   smoking cessation and reduce exposure to smokeless tobacco. Balanced
   protein-energy supplementation was associated with reduced stillbirth
   rates, but larger well-designed trials are required to confirm findings.
   Peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation significantly reduces
   neural tube defects, yet no significant associated reductions in
   stillbirth rates have been documented. Evidence for other nutritional
   interventions including multiple micronutrient and Vitamin A
   supplementation is weak, suggesting the need for further research to
   assess potential of nutritional interventions to reduce stillbirths.
   Conclusion: Antenatal care is widely used in low- and middle-income
   countries, and provides a natural facility-based contact through which
   to provide or educate about many of the interventions we reviewed. The
   impact of broader socially mediated behaviors, such as fertility
   decision-making, access to antenatal care, and maternal diet and
   exposures like tobacco and indoor air pollution during pregnancy, are
   poorly understood, and further research and appropriate interventions
   are needed to test the association of these behaviours with stillbirth
   outcomes. For most nutritional interventions, larger randomised
   controlled trials are needed which report stillbirths disaggregated from
   composite perinatal mortality. Many antepartum stillbirths are
   potentially preventable in low- and middle-income countries,
   particularly through dietary and environmental improvement, and through
   improving the quality of antenatal care - particularly including
   diagnosis and management of high-risk pregnancies - that pregnant women
   receive.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{693-702}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Food consumption is controlled by both internal and external factors.
   Environmental signals associated with food may prepare an animal to
   forage, consume and digest more effectively. Furthermore, environmental
   cues that provide information about food availability enable animals to
   make predictions about future food resources and act upon that knowledge
   in appropriate fashion. For example, when exposed to a cue that signals
   the presence of food, animals can eat beyond their present needs to cope
   with predicted future famine. Interestingly, cues previously paired with
   meal interruption have a similar effect. In two experiments,
   food-deprived rats learned to associate one conditioned stimulus (CS+)
   with delivery of a food unconditioned stimulus (US), and another
   stimulus (IS) with an unexpected termination of CS-US trials.
   Subsequently, both CS+ and IS enhanced consumption of the US food by
   sated rats. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that IS's ability to
   potentiate feeding of sated rats in test depended more on its
   accompanying CS+ termination in training than on its signaling

Abstract = {{Powerful biological mechanisms evolved to defend adequate nutrient
   supply and optimal levels of body weight/adiposity. Low levels of leptin
   indicating food deprivation and depleted fat stores have been identified
   as the strongest signals to induce adaptive biological actions such as
   increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure. In concert with
   other signals from the gut and metabolically active tissues, low leptin
   levels trigger powerful activation of multiple peripheral and brain
   systems to restore energy balance. It is not just neurons in the arcuate
   nucleus, but many other brain systems involved in finding potential food
   sources, smelling and tasting food, and learning to maximize rewarding
   effects of foods, that are affected by low leptin. Food restriction and
   fat depletion thus lead to a `hungry' brain, preoccupied with food. By
   contrast, because of less (adaptive thrifty fuel efficiency) or lost
   (lack of predators) evolutionary pressure, the upper limits of body
   weight/adiposity are not as strongly defended by high levels of leptin
   and other signals. The modern environment is characterized by the
   increased availability of large amounts of energy-dense foods and
   increased presence of powerful food cues, together with minimal physical
   procurement costs and a sedentary lifestyle. Much of these environmental
   influences affect cortico-limbic brain areas concerned with learning and
   memory, reward, mood and emotion. Common obesity results when individual
   predisposition to deal with a restrictive environment, as engraved by
   genetics, epigenetics and/or early life experience, is confronted with
   an environment of plenty. Therefore, increased adiposity in prone
   individuals should be seen as a normal physiological response to a
   changed environment, not in the pathology of the regulatory system. The
   first line of defense should ideally lie in modifications to the
   environment and lifestyle. However, as such modifications will be slow
   and incomplete, it is equally important to gain better insight into how
   the brain deals with environmental stimuli and to develop behavioral
   strategies to better cope with them. Clearly, alternative therapeutic
   strategies such as drugs and bariatric surgery should also be considered
   to prevent or treat this debilitating disease. It will be crucial to
   understand the functional crosstalk between neural systems responding to
   metabolic and environmental stimuli, i.e. crosstalk between hypothalamic
   and cortico-limbic circuitry. International Journal of Obesity (2009)

Abstract = {{Dispersal is a common response to deteriorating conditions such as
   intense competition, food limitation, predation or parasitism. Although
   it provides obvious advantages, dispersal is often assumed to be costly.
   Selection is therefore likely to have acted to decrease these costs, and
   indeed several studies demonstrated that dispersers and philopatric
   individuals differ in their morphology, physiology and/or behavior.
   Using the common lizard (Lacerta viuipara) as our model system, we
   examined the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to the establishment
   of dispersal-dependent behavioral traits. We used a reciprocal
   transplant experiment in which conditions at the maternal site of
   origin, during offspring development in utero, and at the release site
   were manipulated. We then compared activity, social interactions and
   foraging behavior between individuals that stayed philopatric and those
   that dispersed. Most behavioral traits were also measured at birth and
   after the dispersal phase.
   This study demonstrates that (a) 10 months after the dispersal phase,
   there were still marked behavioral differences between dispersing and
   philopatric individuals, (b) the reaction when confronted to another
   individual was also dispersal-status dependent, a result which strongly
   suggests that individuals are able to recognize the dispersal status of
   same-age conspecifics and (c) none of the behavioral characteristics
   were found to be dependent on the environmental conditions (maternal and
   natal environment) indicating a lack of phenotypic plasticity in the
   building of the dispersal-dependent behavioral traits examined. J. Exp.

Abstract = {{Alterations in nutritional factors during early development can exert
   long-term effects on growth, neural function, and associated behaviors.
   The lipid component of milk provides a critical nutritional source for
   generating both energy and essential nutrients for the growth of the
   newborn. The present study, therefore, investigated the hypothesis that
   nutritional supplementation with a complex milk lipid (CML) preparation,
   derived from the milk fat globule membrane rich in phospholipids and
   gangliosides from young rats, has beneficial effects on teaming behavior
   and postnatal growth and development. Male Wistar rat offspring from
   normal pregnancies were treated from neonatal day 10 until postnatal day
   80 with either vehicle or CML at a dose of 0.2\% (low) and 1.0\% (high)
   based on total food intake (n = 16 per group). Neonatal dosing was via
   daily oral gavage, while postweaning dosing was via gel supplementation
   to a standard chow diet. Animals underwent behavioral tasks related to
   spatial memory, teaming, and cognitive function. Complex milk lipid
   supplementation significantly increased linear growth rate (P < .05),
   and the improved growth trajectory was not related to changes in body
   composition as quantified by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning
   or altered plasma lipid profiles. Moreover, this effect was not dose
   dependent and not attributable to the contribution to total energy
   intake of the CML composition. Supplementation of the CML to growing
   rats resulted in statistically significant improvements in parameters
   related to novelty recognition (P < .02) and spatial memory (P < .05)
   using standard behavioral techniques, but operant testing showed no
   significant differences between treatment groups. Supplementation with a
   CML containing gangliosides had positive growth and teaming behavioral

Abstract = {{Objective. This study investigates the clustering of a broad range of
   health-compromising and delinquent behaviors. We examine whether these
   behaviors belong to a single but broad cluster. `risk-taking behavior',
   and whether the nature and degree of clustering in adolescents differs
   from that in adults.
   Method. A representative sample (N =4395) of the Dutch population aged
   12 to 40 (overall response rate 67\%), was asked about various
   health-compromising behaviors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking,
   illegal drug use, unsafe sexual behavior, physical inactivity, poor
   nutrition (such as skipping breakfast and not eating fruit and
   vegetables), poor sleep behavior, unlawful traffic behavior, and
   delinquent and aggressive behavior. Data were collected from fall 2005
   to spring 2006 using internet questionnaires and face-to-face
   computer-assisted interviews.
   Results. No single broad cluster was found. Instead, there were several
   separate but interrelated clusters. The contents of these clusters
   differed between age groups. For young adolescents (12-15) two clusters
   were identified: Alcohol and Delinquency. For older adolescents (16-18)
   and adults (19-40) three clusters were identified: Alcohol, Delinquency
   and Health.
   Conclusion. The findings of this study support a more integrated
   approach to promoting healthier lifestyles, and suggest that the
   behavior targets of integrated prevention programs should be different

Abstract = {{The fitness consequences of plural breeding vary considerably among
   social vertebrates. We tested three hypotheses for the direct
   reproductive fitness consequences of group living in the degu Octodon
   degus, a social rodent endemic to central Chile. To test the `benefits
   of communal care' hypothesis, we determined the relationship between the
   number of females per group, per capita direct fitness and offspring
   survival. To test the `food abundance and quality' hypothesis, we
   determined the relationship between the biomass of preferred foods at
   burrow systems, group size, per capita direct fitness and offspring
   survival. To test the `predation risk' hypothesis, we determined the
   relationship between group size, the density of burrow entrances to
   which social groups had access, per capita direct fitness, and survival
   of adults and offspring. Group size of core females (i.e. those with
   50\% or more nightly overlap) was negatively correlated with per capita
   direct fitness, but not with the number of females per group or total
   group size. Group living did not enhance the survival of offspring.
   Greater biomass of food (at 3 m and 9 m) and burrow density were not
   linked to larger groups and offspring survival. Our results did not
   support predictions of the `benefits of communal care', `food abundance
   and quality' or `predation risk' hypothesis. Pending microsatellite
   analyses, we hypothesize that survival benefits linked to foraging group
   size and not reproductive fitness benefits may explain the evolution of

Volume = {{78}},

Pages = {{183-188}},

Abstract = {{Indirect benefits derived by females that mate with males that express
   preferred traits are important to our understanding of `good genes'
   models of sexual selection. However, few studies have explored male
   courtship behaviours with potential indirect benefits conferred to
   females in order to ascertain whether these behaviours serve as honest
   indicators of male quality. Using a common species of wolf spider,
   Pardosa milvina, we addressed the honesty of male courtship behaviours
   in two laboratory experiments. In our first experiment, we quantified
   the repeatability of courtship rate in adult males that were manipulated
   to be in high or low condition and were sequentially presented with
   adult virgin females that similarly differed in body condition. In our
   second experiment, we explored the effect of male courtship rate on
   several measures of fitness: number of offspring produced, days until
   offspring emerged and offspring viability measured as offspring
   survival. Our experiments show that male courtship rate is statistically
   significantly repeatable except when males in high condition have
   repeated encounters with females in low condition. Our results also
   reveal that females have the potential to gain indirect genetic benefits
   by mating with males that naturally court at high rates: females
   produced more offspring that emerged from eggsacs sooner and survived
   starvation better compared to females that mated with males that
   naturally courted at low rates. Our study provides additional support
   that male courtship rate is an honest indicator of quality, and it makes
   the novel finding that the repeatability of courtship rate is context
   sensitive. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{When populations face different environmental conditions, both local
   adaptation and phenotypic plasticity may cause interpopulation
   divergence of behavioral or phenotypic properties on which mate choice
   is based. If sustained, this may result in genetic differentiation even
   in the presence of extant gene flow. Condition dependence of mate choice
   is one of the main mechanisms explaining these environmental effects. We
   tested whether experimental food stress affects mate choice in male and
   female Pirata piraticus spiders from one heavily polluted and one
   unpolluted reference population. Compared with control females,
   food-stressed females from the reference population showed a decreased
   probability of copulation and preferred smaller mates. Females from the
   polluted population, in contrast, did not show a significant response to
   food stress and showed size-assortative mating, most strongly under food
   stress. We explain these results in 2 complementary ways. First, spiders
   from populations that are not adapted to cope with stress may be less
   willing to mate when eggs are not fully matured. Second, food-deprived
   females may show a larger responsiveness toward smaller males because
   the latter resemble prey more and hungry females tend to attack moving
   objects more often. Results from this study support the prediction that
   variation in body condition, driven by local ecological factors, may
   affect mating behavior and may ultimately lead to population divergence

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Although cardiac rehabilitation programs have been shown to
   decrease cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality, few programs
   have integrated a balanced mind/body approach in which patients are
   taught the relaxation response and utilize cognitive behavior skills for
   stress management, along with diet and exercise. We examined the medical
   and psychological outcomes of patients treated in such a cardiac
   rehabilitation program in a general hospital setting.
   METHODS: From 1997 to 2005, outcomes were measured in 637 patients with
   coronary artery disease at baseline and after a 3-month program.
   Components of the intervention included smoking cessation, moderate
   aerobic exercise, nutrition counseling, relaxation response training,
   and cognitive/behavioral skills.
   RESULTS: Men and women improved significantly with respect to medical
   outcomes (blood pressure, lipids, weight, exercise conditioning,
   frequency of symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath) and
   psychological outcomes (general severity index, depression, anxiety, and
   hostility) (P<.0001). Patients considered ``at higher risk{''} for
   cardiac events due to high baseline measures improved their measures to
   a less than ``at higher risk{''} level. Data indicate that specific
   components of the intervention, that is, increased relaxation response
   practice and exercise, significantly contributed to these improvements
   (P<.05). Furthermore, age and gender differences, particularly for
   psychological measures, were found; younger patients and female patients
   had greater improvements than older patients and male patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary data for a subsequent
   randomized control trial to test mind/body-based interventions to
   determine the most effective outcomes at an affordable cost.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular commitment to a specific lineage is controlled by differential
   silencing of genes, which in turn depends on epigenetic processes such
   as DNA methylation and histone modification. During early embryogenesis,
   the mammalian genome is `wiped clean' of most epigenetic modifications,
   which are progressively re-established during embryonic development.
   Thus, the epigenome of each mature cellular lineage carries the record
   of its developmental history. The subsequent trajectory and pattern of
   development are also responsive to environmental influences, and such
   plasticity is likely to have an epigenetic basis. epigenetic marks may
   be transmitted across generations, either directly by persisting through
   meiosis or indirectly through replication in the next generation of the
   conditions in which the epigenetic change occurred. Developmental
   plasticity evolved to match an organism to its environment, and a
   mismatch between the phenotypic outcome of adaptive plasticity and the
   current environment increases the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular
   disease. These considerations point to epigenetic processes as a key
   mechanism that underpins the developmental origins of chronic
   noncommunicable disease. Here, we review the evidence that environmental
   influences during mammalian development lead to stable changes in the
   epigenome that alter the individual's susceptibility to chronic
   metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and discuss the clinical
   implications.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Personality traits underlie maladaptive behaviors, and
   cognitive and emotional disturbances that contribute to major
   preventable causes of global disease burden. This study examines
   detailed personality profiles of underweight, normal, and overweight
   individuals to provide insights into the causes and treatments of
   abnormal weight. Methods: More than half of the population from four
   towns in Sardinia, Italy (n = 5693; age = 14-94 years; mean +/- standard
   deviation = 43 +/- 17 years) were assessed on multiple anthropometric
   measures and 30 facets that comprehensively cover the five major
   dimensions of personality, using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.
   Results: High Neuroticism and low Conscientiousness were associated with
   being underweight and obese, respectively. High Impulsiveness
   (specifically eating-behavior items) and low Order were associated with
   body mass index categories of overweight and obese, and with measures of
   abdominal adiposity (waist and hip circumference). Those scoring in the
   top 10\% of Impulsiveness were about 4 kg heavier than those in the
   bottom 10\%, an effect independent and larger than the FTO genetic
   variant. Prospective analyses confirmed that Impulsiveness and Order
   were significant predictors of general and central measures of adiposity
   assessed 3 years later. Conclusions: Overweight and obese individuals
   have difficulty resisting cravings and lack methodical and organized
   behaviors that might influence diet and weight control. Although
   individuals' traits have limited impact on the current obesogenic
   epidemic, personality traits can improve clinical assessment, suggest
   points of intervention, and help tailor prevention and treatment
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Predators affect prey demography through direct predation and through
   the costs of antipredator behavioral responses, or risk effects.
   Experiments have shown that risk effects can comprise a substantial
   proportion of a predator's total effect on prey dynamics, but we know
   little about their strength in wild populations, or the physiological
   mechanisms that mediate them. When wolves are present, elk alter their
   grouping patterns, vigilance, foraging behavior, habitat selection, and
   diet. These responses are associated with decreased progesterone levels,
   decreased calf production, and reduced population size {[}Creel S,
   Christianson D, Liley S, Winnie JA (2007) Science 315: 960]. Two general
   mechanisms for the effect of predation risk on reproduction have been
   proposed: the predation stress hypothesis and the
   predator-sensitive-food hypothesis. Here, we used enzyme immunoassay to
   measure fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations for 1,205 samples
   collected from 4 elk populations over 4 winters to test the hypothesis
   that the effect of predation risk on elk reproduction is mediated by
   chronic stress. Across populations and years, fecal glucocorticoid
   concentrations were not related to predator-prey ratios, progesterone
   concentrations or calf-cow ratios. Overall, the effect of wolf presence
   on elk reproduction is better explained by changes in foraging patterns
   that carry nutritional costs than by changes in glucocorticoid
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Vigilance in animals decreases with group size in many species of birds
   and mammals, but the effect of group size can be confounded by several
   ecological factors, most notably food density. Given that large groups
   often aggregate in areas of higher food density and that vigilance may
   be reduced when animals feed more, the group-size effect of vigilance
   may be confounded by the direct effect of food density on vigilance. In
   this paper, I examine the theoretical expectations regarding the effect
   of food density on vigilance and review the available empirical
   evidence. Two bodies of theory predict either no relationship or a
   negative relationship between vigilance and food density, but none has
   been tested explicitly. The empirical support for a negative
   relationship is mixed given that many studies actually document a
   positive correlation between vigilance and food density. I review the
   factors modulating the effect of food density on vigilance and show that
   there are several reasons to believe that the case against a confounding
   effect of food density is not as strong as expected. In fact, food
   density can actually mask the expected decrease in vigilance with group
   size. A statement about the magnitude of the group-size effect on
   vigilance will require an assessment of the role of food density as well
   as the many factors reviewed here that modulate the effect of food
   density on vigilance in birds and mammals. (C) 2009 The Association for

Abstract = {{Socially influenced learning is important because it can drive the
   spread of novel behaviours among individuals within and between
   generations. While work on a few vertebrates suggests the conditions
   favouring the use of social over individual learning, we know little
   about the evolution of social learning. As a part of an ongoing
   examination of the evolutionary roots of social learning in insects, we
   tested for social learning in locusts, Locusta migratoria. Locusts
   showed rapid individual learning, preferring a diet they ate for a
   single meal of only 20 min over another diet of equal nutritional
   quality. Locusts, however, did not show stronger preference for novel
   food that they had previously consumed while in the presence of a
   conspecific experienced with that food. Furthermore, focal locusts did
   not learn about novel food from (1) experienced conspecifics that were
   observable through a screen, (2) interactions with conspecifics that had
   previously fed on and gave off odours from novel food and (3)
   cannibalizing conspecifics that had recently fed on novel food. Whereas
   our results extend previous work indicating excellent individual
   learning in locusts, they provide no evidence for socially influenced
   learning in a species that, in its gregarious form, has the opportunity
   for social learning and could benefit from such an ability. (C) 2009 The

Abstract = {{One potential trade-off that bold individuals face is between increased
   predation risks and gains in resources. Individuals experiencing high
   predation and hungry individuals (or individuals with low body
   condition) are predicted to show increased boldness. We examined one
   behavioral trait previously reported to be associated with boldness (the
   time individual fish needed to emerge from shelter) in various
   populations of mollies (Poecilia spp.). Our study system included
   several southern Mexican surface streams with high piscine predation and
   high food availability, sulfidic surface streams with high avian
   predation, in which the inhabiting fish show reduced body condition, and
   a sulfidic cave, where predation and body condition are low. Our
   comparison revealed very short times to emerge from the start box in
   populations from non-sulfidic streams. In sulfidic habitats (whether
   surface or cave), it took individual Poecilia mexicana considerably
   longer to emerge from the start box, and the same difference was also
   found in an independent comparison between P. mexicana and the closely
   related, highly sulfide-adapted Poecilia sulphuraria. Fish reared under
   common garden conditions (in the absence of predators and hydrogen
   sulfide) showed intermediate boldness scores to the extremes observed in
   the field. Our data thus indicate that (a) boldness is shaped by
   environmental conditions/experiential effects, but is not heritable, (b)
   predation affects boldness in the predicted direction, but (c) low body
   condition leads to reduced boldness. Extremophile Poecilia spp. spend
   most of their time surfacing to survive under sulfidic and hypoxic
   conditions, which exposes them to increased levels of predations, but
   the fish forage on the bottom. Hence, in this system, increased boldness
   does not increase foraging success. We argue that energy limitation
   favors reducing energetically costly behaviors, and exploring novel
   environments may be just one of them.}},

Abstract = {{Predators are increasingly recognized as key elements in food webs
   because of their ability to link the fluxes of nutrients and energy
   between spatially separated food chains. However, in the context of food
   web connectivity, predator populations have been mainly treated as
   homogeneous units, despite compelling evidence of individual
   specialization in resource use. It is conceivable that individuals of a
   predatory species use different resources associated with spatially
   separated food chains, thereby decoupling cross-habitat linkages. We
   tested whether intrapopulation differences in habitat use in the
   generalist freshwater predator Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) led to
   long-term niche partitioning and affected the degree of ecological
   habitat coupling. We evaluated trophic niche variability at successively
   larger timescales by analyzing gut contents and stable isotopes (delta
   C-13 and delta N-15) in liver and muscle, tissues that provide
   successively longer integration of trophic activity. We found that the
   use of distinct habitats in perch led to intrapopulation niche
   partitioning between pelagic and littoral subpopulations, consistent
   through the various timescales. Pelagic fish showed a narrower niche,
   lower individual specialization, and more stable trophic behavior than
   littoral fish, as could be expected from inhabiting a relatively less
   diverse environment. This result indicated that substantial niche
   reduction could occur in a generalist predator at the subpopulation
   level, consistent with the use of a habitat that provides fewer chances
   of individual specialization. We showed that intrapopulation niche
   partitioning limits the ability of individual predators to link
   spatially separated food chains. In addition, we suggest a quantitative,
   standardized approach based on stable isotopes to measure the degree of
   habitat coupling mediated by a top predator.}},

Abstract = {{An animal's level of vigilance depends on various environmental factors

   In addition, several individual traits may influence vigilance. We
   investigated the effects of body condition, social rank and the state of
   pregnancy on individual vigilance (scanning) rates in individually
   marked European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) of a field enclosure
   population. We found lower rates in young rabbits than in adult females,
   but male and female juveniles did not differ. Vigilance of juveniles was
   positively correlated with their age-dependent body mass (used as a
   measure of body condition), i.e. young rabbits with lower body condition
   scanned less. We suggest that juveniles with low body condition were
   trading off vigilance against feeding to maximise their growth. In
   contrast, there was no significant correlation between body mass and
   vigilance in adult females. Adult females increased scanning rates
   during late pregnancy, which might constitute a behavioural compensation
   because of their lower capacity to escape predator attacks. In addition,
   adult females with low social ranks scanned more than high ranking
   individuals, likely because of their higher risk of attacks by
   conspecifics. In summary, our results highlight various individual

Abstract = {{Pond-drying is a model for understanding the causes of life history
   variation in metamorphic organisms. However, we know relatively little
   about how interactions among specific proximate cues of pond-drying
   affect juvenile life history, how those responses might be mitigated by
   diet, and the post-metamorphic consequences for adult fitness. I
   manipulated larval diet, water depth, and water temperature during the
   aquatic larval stage of a temporary pond-dwelling caddisfly, Limnephilus
   indivisus. I predicted that shallow depths and warm temperatures (depth
   x temperature) associated with pond-drying would have negative effects
   on larval survival, growth, development, adult size, female fecundity,
   and adult longevity, but that supplementation of the larval diet should
   mitigate the trade-off between juvenile growth and pre-reproductive
   mortality risk by ameliorating the negative effects of pond-drying (diet
   x depth, diet x temperature) on these traits. Larval survival was
   enhanced by diet supplementation but was not affected by depth or
   temperature. Larval diet and water temperatures acted independently on
   growth, development, and female size, and growth rates were higher when
   larval diets were supplemented relative to ambient diets; development
   times were shorter when temperatures were warmer relative to colder;
   adult females were larger when larvae were fed a supplemented diet but
   smaller when reared in warm water. Larval growth and development were
   not affected by depth, but female size was reduced under shallow
   relative to deep conditions. Female longevity and fecundity were
   affected by the larval diet x female size interaction. Surprisingly,
   this was independent of the depth x temperature interaction on female
   longevity and fecundity suggesting that reductions in adult fitness due
   to juvenile abiotic conditions can be independent of size-at-maturity.
   Future studies should quantify the effect of proximate cues of
   pond-drying on juvenile survival and life history as well as adult
   fitness correlates.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prospective studies linking infant temperament, or
   behavioral style, to infant body composition are lacking. In this
   longitudinal study (3 to 18 months), we seek to examine the associations
   between two dimensions of infant temperament (distress to limitations
   and activity level) and two anthropometric indicators (weight-for-length
   z-scores (WLZ) and skin fold (SF) measures) in a population at high risk
   of overweight.
   Methods: Data are from the Infant Care and Risk of Obesity Project, a
   longitudinal study of North Carolina low income African American
   mother-infant dyads (n = 206). Two temperament dimensions were assessed
   using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. A high distress to
   limitations score denotes an infant whose mother perceives that s/he
   often cries or fusses, and a high activity level score one who moves
   his/her limbs and squirms frequently. Cross-sectional analyses were
   conducted using ordinary least squares regression. Fixed effects
   longitudinal models were used to estimate anthropometric outcomes as a
   function of time varying infant temperament.
   Results: In longitudinal models, increased activity levels were
   associated with later decreased fatness and WLZ. In contrast, high
   levels of distress to limitations were associated with later increased
   fatness at all time points and later increased WLZ at 12 months.
   Conclusion: Infant temperament dimensions contribute to our
   understanding of the role of behavior in the development of the risk of
   overweight in the formative months of life. Identification of modifiable
   risk factors early in life may help target strategies for establishing
   healthy lifestyles prior to the onset of overweight.}},

   responses in the open field test, characterised by more time spent in
   the aversive central zone and a higher frequency of central and middle

Abstract = {{Nutrition during pregnancy and in early life may influence developmental

   Folate intake during pregnancy, as well as maternal
   methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype, influences the
   availability of methyl donors for methylation during gestation and
   therefore may be associated with offspring body composition in
   childhood. We looked at associations between maternal folic acid
   supplementation at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy, folate intake in the
   diet (from self-reported FFQ) at 32 weeks of pregnancy and offspring
   body composition at age 9 years among 5783 children from a

Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of anti-predator behavioral responses should be
   functions of the actual risk of predation, the availability of the
   prey's resources, and the physiological state of the prey. For example,
   a food-stressed individual risks starvation when hiding from predators,
   while a well-fed organism can better afford to hide (and pay the cost of
   not foraging). Similarly, the benefits of resource acquisition are
   probably highest for the prey in the poorest state, while there may be
   diminishing returns for prey nearing satiation. Empirical studies of
   state-dependent behavior are only beginning, however, and few studies
   have investigated interactions between all three potentially important
   factors. Here I present the results of a laboratory experiment where I
   manipulated the physiological state of pond snails (Physa gyrina), the
   abundance of algal resources, and predation cues (Belostoma flumineum
   waterbugs consuming snails) in a full factorial design to assess their
   direct effects on snail behavior and indirect effects on algal biomass.
   On average, snails foraged more when resources were abundant, and when
   predators were absent. Snails also foraged more when previously exposed
   to physiological stress. Snails spent more time at the water's surface
   (a refuging behavior) in the presence of predation cues on average, but
   predation, resource levels, and prey state had interactive effects on
   refuge use. There was a consistent positive trait-mediated indirect
   effect of predators on algal biomass, across all resource levels and
   prey states. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{How individuals balance time spent satisfying nutritional needs and time
   spent being vigilant to protect against potential predation has received
   abundant attention from researchers. Evidence indicates that both social
   conditions and predator risk affect how individuals perceive
   environmental threat, however, the relative influence of each type of
   risk remains unclear. The risk allocation hypothesis considers how
   individuals respond to predation risk over time by adapting their
   investment in high-quality or low-quality vigilance. Here we use the
   risk allocation hypothesis as a guide to examine how different risk
   factors influence vigilance quantity and quality in Cape ground
   squirrels, Xerus inauris. We tested how the social conditions of age,
   sex, distance to a safe refuge, distance from a nearest neighbour and
   predator risk affect the amount of time ( quantity) individuals spend
   vigilant. Individuals were more vigilant in areas with more potential
   predators and when they were further from a safe refuge or nearest
   neighbour. We then tested whether these risk factors that affected
   vigilance quantity also affected vigilance quality by measuring
   exclusive vigilance (high-cost, high-quality) and
   shared-foraging-vigilance (low-cost, low-quality). Individuals in
   high-predation risk areas invested more time in high-cost vigilance
   behaviour than in low-cost vigilance/foraging behaviour compared with
   individuals in low-predation risk areas. Since squirrels invested in
   high-cost vigilance significantly more than in low-cost vigilance
   regardless of distance to a refuge or other squirrels, we suggest that
   combined foraging with vigilance compromises vigilance to lower its
   quality. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The effects of inducible defenses and constitutive defenses on
   population dynamics were investigated in a freshwater plankton system
   with rotifers as predators and different algal strains as prey. We made
   predictions for these systems using a chemostat predator-prey model and
   focused on population stability and predator persistence as a function
   of flow-through rate. The model exhibits three major types of behavior
   at a high nutrient concentration: (1) at high dilution rates, only algae
   exist; (2) at intermediate dilution rates, algae and rotifers show
   stable coexistence; (3) at low dilution rates, large population
   fluctuations occur, with low minimum densities entailing a risk of
   stochastic rotifer extinctions. The size and location of the
   corresponding areas in parameter space critically depend on the type of
   algal defense strategy. In an 83-day high-nutrient chemostat experiment
   we changed the dilution rate every 3 weeks, from 0.7 to 0.5 to 0.3 to
   0.1 per day. Within this range of dilution rates, rotifers and algae
   coexisted, and population fluctuations of algae clearly increased as
   dilution rates decreased. The CV of herbivore densities was highest at
   the end of the experiment, when the dilution rate was low. On day 80,
   herbivorous rotifers had become undetectable in all three chemostats
   with permanently defended algae (where rotifer densities had already
   been low) and in two out of three chemostats where rotifers had been
   feeding on algae with inducible defenses (that represented more edible
   food). We interpret our results in relation to the paradox of

Abstract = {{There is some agreement in the food policy literature in that inception

   modelling. We report the results of an empirical application to
   conceptualise food decision making in three specific Mediterranean

   indicates that public attitudes toward GM food are being formed from a
   reasoning mechanism that departs from trust in science and in public

Abstract = {{Despite the potential impact on prey fitness and predator-prey
   interactions, most studies of predation risk ignore physiological
   responses and their dependence upon food level and sex. Therefore, we
   reared male and female larvae of the damselfly Lestes viridis under
   predator stress (dragonfly larvae) at high and low food levels, and
   subsequently scored for important variables of insect immune defence
   (i.e. phenoloxidase) and antioxidant defence {[}i.e. superoxide
   dismutase, and catalase (CAT)]. Under predation risk, larvae did not
   decrease growth rate or immune defence, and only slightly reduced food
   intake in the high food treatment, probably because of time stress, i.e.
   little time available to complete the larval development. However,
   larvae facing predator stress did show an upregulation of antioxidant
   enzymes. This upregulation was dependent upon food level for CAT and
   both food level and sex for SOD, consistent with energetic constraints
   and sex differences in the link between longevity and adult fitness. Our
   results illustrate that predator stress can influence life history,
   behavioural and physiological responses differentially and in a
   context-dependent way. This implies that non-consumptive physiological
   effects of predators on their prey show independent yet similar

Abstract = {{The evolution of metabolic rate-temperature (MR-T) reaction norms is of
   fundamental importance to physiological ecology. Metabolic cold
   adaptation (MCA) predicts that populations or species from cooler
   environments will have either a higher metabolic rate at a common
   temperature or steeper MR-T relationships, indicating greater
   sensitivity of respiratory metabolism to temperature. Support for MCA
   has been found in some insect species by comparing species or
   populations differing in latitude. However, the generality of these
   findings are contentious, with most studies either unable to account for
   phenotypic plasticity or the evolutionary relatedness of species or
   populations. Hence, the importance of MCA is vigorously debated from
   both evolutionary and ecological perspectives. Furthermore, few species,
   particularly from tropical environments, have been shown to differ in
   MR-T sensitivity along altitudinal temperature gradients. Here, using
   four populations of tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes, Diptera:
   Glossinidae) from thermally distinct geographic regions, we test the
   hypothesis that there is evolved variation in MR-T relationships to cold
   climates. We found that a high-altitude equatorial population from a
   cool habitat has a steeper MR-T reaction norm. By contrast, other
   populations from warmer environments in East Africa do not differ with
   respect to their MR-T reaction norms. Squared-change parsimony analyses,
   based on the combined mitochondrial 16S rDNA ribosomal subunit and
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), support the hypothesis of adaptive
   differentiation of MR-T reaction norms in the cool-climate population.
   Seasonal adjustments or laboratory-temperature-induced phenotypic
   plasticity changed the intercept of the reaction norm rather than the
   slope, and thus the observed intraspecific variation in slopes of MR-T
   reaction norms could not be accounted for by phenotypic plasticity.
   These results therefore suggest evolutionary adaptation of MR-T reaction
   norms to cool climates (<22 degrees C) in tsetse and provide novel
   support for MCA within an insect species.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral changes of animal species can influence the consequence of
   population dynamics. One of the most remarkable behaviors of animal
   species is the aggregation by which species can reduce predation risk as
   a consequence of dilution or the other effects by forming a group.
   Empirical studies have demonstrated that an incompatibility exists in
   aggregation sincere source competition might become severe at the cost
   of reducing predation pressure from predatory species. Parental care by
   supplying the food consumed by adults to their juveniles would reduce
   the mortality of juvenile due to starvation, but it would reduce the
   reproduction rate at the same time. In this paper, we study a class of
   stage structured resource-consumer models to investigate the effect of
   behavioral changes on population dynamics. It is shown that under the
   presence of trade-off in parental care, moderate degrees of parental
   care will be favored as maximizing the equilibrium density of consumers.
   For consumer species having a long maturation period, consumer species
   might get benefit from dilution effects as a result of aggregation
   despite the elevated resource competition. Aggregation gives rise to two
   different outcomes in consumer extinction. Resource exhaustion as a
   consequence of over-exploitation can induce extinction of consumers due
   to Allee effects if aggregation strongly mediates juvenile survival. (C)

Abstract = {{The increase in the incidence of obesity and eating disorders has
   promoted research aimed at understanding the aetiology of abnormal
   eating behaviours. Apart from metabolic factors, obesity is caused by
   overeating. Clinical reports have led to the suggestion that some
   individuals may develop addictive-like behaviours when consuming
   palatable foods, and compulsive eating plays a similar dominant role in
   obesity as compulsive drug taking does in drug addiction. The progress
   made in the development of treatment strategies for obesity is limited,
   in part, because the physiological and neurological causes and
   consequences of compulsive eating behaviour are not clearly understood
   and cannot readily be studied in human subjects. We have developed
   experimental approaches that reflect the functioning of the components
   of eating control, including compulsive food taking in rats. Rats that
   are given free choice between standard chow and a palatable,
   chocolate-containing `Cafeteria Diet' (CD) develop distinct signs of
   compulsive food taking that appear at an early stage. These include the
   inability to adapt intake behaviour in periods of limited or
   bitter-tasting CD access, continued food intake during resting phases
   and changes in fine structure of feeding (duration, distribution and
   recurrence of feeding bouts). The model will help examine the
   neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive food seeking and food taking

   compounds on compulsive eating and other components of food-taking
   behaviour in detail. For future use of genetic models, the possibility

Abstract = {{The last decade has seen the emergence of two new developments in
   behavioural ecology: the discovery of animal personalities and a new
   approach to the analyses of animal behaviour, biological markets.
   Although both regard individual differences in behaviour as adaptive in
   their own right these two developments appear, at first glance, to be
   opposing approaches to analysing animal behaviour. Personalities consist
   of suites of behaviours that are correlated across situations (e.g. some
   animals are consistently more or less aggressive across situations than
   other animals) and assumes that animals are limited in their response to
   their environment. By contrast, the biological market approach considers
   organisms as traders of commodities (e.g. food or grooming) where the
   exchange rates of commodities changes with time and is influenced by
   shifts in the abundance and demand for the commodity, as happens in
   human markets. Biological markets thus view animal behaviour as
   extremely plastic whereas the putative existence of animal personalities
   suggests that animal behaviour may be relatively inflexible. However,
   the two approaches maybe more similar than heretofore realized and may
   be complementary rather than opposing. Here I briefly review each
   approach and show how animal personalities can arise from a biological
   market situation.}},

   the recommendation by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services on
   the use of these interventions. Weight-related outcomes, including
   weight in pounds or kilograms, BMI, and percentage body fat were used to
   assess effectiveness of these programs.
   This review found that worksite nutrition and physical activity programs
   achieve modest improvements in employee weight status at the 6-12-month
   follow-up. A pooled effect estimate of -2.8 pounds (95\% CI=-4.6, -1.0)
   was found based on nine RCTs, and a decrease in BMI of -0.5 (95\%
   CI=-0.8, -0.2) was found based on six RCTs. The findings appear to be
   applicable to both male and female employees, across a range of worksite
   settings.
   Most of the studies combined informational and behavioral strategies to
   influence diet and physical activity; fewer studies modified the work
   environment (e.g., cafeteria, exercise facilities) to promote healthy

Abstract = {{Life history theory predicts that individuals paired with attractive
   mates may invest more in offspring. Such differential investment may
   amplify the effects of genetic quality on fitness. Attractiveness can
   include `good gene' and `complementary gene' components, but how the
   latter affects parental investment remains unknown. We found that
   nestling song sparrows with genetically dissimilar parents grew faster
   than did nestlings whose parents were genetically more similar to one
   another. A cross-fostering experiment revealed complementary gene
   effects on growth; nestlings produced by genetically dissimilar parents
   grew faster than their adoptive `siblings' reared in the same nest but
   produced by parents that were more genetically similar. To explore
   whether parental investment exaggerates these complementary gene effects
   on growth, we monitored parental nest visits. Maternal visits were
   negatively related to genetic similarity between mates. The novel
   finding that females adjust levels of care according to the genetic
   diversity of their offspring suggests that parental investment can
   amplify complementary gene effects on fitness. (C) 2009 The Association

Abstract = {{Dog diets may differ in their effectiveness of maintaining satiety after
   a meal. Consequently, sensations of hunger, feeding motivation, physical
   activity, and sensitivity to environmental stressors; may be increased.
   Dietary fibre may be effective in prolonging postprandial satiety
   depending on type and inclusion level. This study evaluated the effect
   of fibre fermentability on behaviour in dogs. Sixteen healthy adult dogs
   were housed individually and fed a low-fermentable fibre (LFF) diet
   containing 8.5\% cellulose or a high-fermentable fibre (HFF) diet
   containing 8.5\% sugar beet pulp and 2\% inulin. Dogs were fed two equal
   portions at 8:30 and 18:30 according to energy requirements. Behaviour
   of dogs in their home-cage was recorded and analyzed by instantaneous
   scan sampling (2 x 24 h with 15 min intervals) and focal sampling
   continuous recordings (10 min per animal per hour, from 9:00 until
   18:00). Dogs were subjected to a behaviour test composed of the subtests
   open-field, sudden-silence, novel-object, and acoustic-startle. The
   behavioural responses of each dog were recorded. Scores for the scan and
   focal samples were expressed per clock hour and DIET x TIME effects were
   tested statistically using Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML). Data from
   the tests were examined using principal component analysis resulting in
   the compilation of two components. Data were tested statistically for
   DIET and DIET x SUBTEST effects using REML. Variables specific for the
   open-field and novel-object test were analyzed using analysis of
   variance. For the scans, a significant DIET x TIME effect was found for
   resting. At night and in the morning, HFF dogs rested more compared to
   LIFF dogs, but they rested less between 14:00 and 17:00. For the
   continuous recordings, the main findings were a tendency for DIET x TIME
   effect for time spent resting with a pattern consistent with that for
   the scans. The interaction was significant for inactive-alert (lie with
   head up or sitting) with HFF-fed dogs having lower values around
   10:00-11:00 and higher values hereafter. Finally, time spent tail
   wagging was significantly higher for LFF-fed dogs just before the
   evening meal that may indicate higher level of arousal. For the
   behaviour tests, no significant DIET or DIET x SUBTEST effects were
   detected. It is concluded that compared to the LFF diet, the HFF diet
   increased inactivity in kennelled beagle dogs likely through the
   prolongation of postprandial satiety. This effect did not change the
   reaction to stressful events in kennelled laboratory dogs. Enhanced
   susceptibility to environmental stressors at times of hunger in
   sensitive companion dogs may occur but requires further study. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Animal prey has developed a variety of behavioural strategies to avoid
   predation. Many fish species form shoals in the open water or seek
   refuge in structurally complex habitats. Since anti-predator strategies
   bear costs and are energy-demanding, we hypothesised that the
   nutritional state of prey should modify the performance level and
   efficiency of such strategies. In aquaria either containing or lacking a
   structured refuge habitat, well-fed or food-deprived juvenile roach
   (Rutilus rutilus) were exposed to an open-water predator (pikeperch,
   Sander lucioperca). Controls were run without predators. In the presence
   of the predator, roach enhanced the performance of the anti-predator
   strategy and increased the use of the refuge habitat whereby
   food-deprived roach were encountered more often in the structure than
   well-fed roach. Nonetheless more starved than well-fed roach were fed
   upon by the predator. In the treatments offering only open-water areas,
   roach always formed dense shoals in the presence of the predator. The
   shoal density, however, was lower in starved roach. Starving fish in
   shoals experienced the highest predation mortality across all
   experimental treatments. The experiment confirmed the plasticity of the
   anti-predator behaviour in roach and demonstrated that food deprivation
   diminished the efficiency of shoaling more strongly than the efficiency
   of hiding. The findings may be relevant to spatial distribution of prey
   and predator-prey interactions under natural conditions because when
   prey are confronted with phases of reduced resource availability,
   flexible anti-predator strategies may lead to dynamic habitat use
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of fetal programming states that changes in the fetal
   environment during sensitive periods of organ development may cause
   long-lasting changes in the structure and functioning of these organs
   later in life and influence the risk for chronic diseases such as
   coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Fetal growth is a summary
   marker of the fetal environment and is reflected by relatively
   easy-to-obtain measures of size at birth such as birth weight. In the
   last two decades, a body of evidence emerged linking fetal growth with
   behavioural and mental health outcomes later in life. Cognitive
   functioning and behavioural problems in childhood, in particular
   inattention/hyperactivity, have been shown to be inversely related to
   fetal growth. Although results are mixed, risk for personality disorders
   and schizophrenia seems to be linked with fetal growth and adversity,
   while the evidence for mood disorders is weak. Vulnerability for
   psychopathology may also be influenced by prenatal adversity. There is
   evidence for associations of fetal growth with temperament in childhood
   as well as stress reactivity and distress. The associations of fetal
   growth with mental health later in life are potentially caused by
   specific prenatal factors such as maternal smoking, alcohol,
   toxins/drugs, nutrition, psychosocial stress and infection during
   pregnancy. The mechanisms likely involve changes in neurodevelopment and
   in the set point of neuroendocrine systems, and there is evidence that

   factors. Future studies should examine the effects of specific prenatal

   was performed by disc on water method for five consecutive days. During

   reactivities were drastically decreased as revealed by reduced staining

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Previous research has shown that youth who are homeless engage in
   high-risk behaviors. However, there has been little information
   published on nutritional and physical activity behaviors in this
   population, and studies comparing homeless youth in school with their
   non-homeless peers are scarce. This study compares weight-related risk
   behaviors of public high school students in Massachusetts based on
   homeless status.
   METHODS
   We obtained data from 3264 9th through 12th grade students who
   participated in the 2005 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
   Multivariable logistic regression, controlling for gender, grade,
   race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, was performed to assess the
   relationship between homeless status as defined by the McKinney-Vento
   Homeless Assistance Act and weight-related indicators. Analyses were
   weighted and adjusted for the multistage complex sampling design.
   RESULTS
   Of this sample, 4.2\% reported being homeless (n = 152). Higher
   prevalence of homelessness was found among males, racial/ethnic
   minorities, sexual minorities, and students who were not in a
   traditional grade level. The distribution of body mass index was similar
   among students who were homeless and non-homeless (underweight 4.0 and
   3.0\%, and overweight 27.1 and 27.1\%, respectively). Homeless students
   were more likely than non-homeless students to report disordered
   weight-control behaviors including fasting (aOR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.4-4.5)
   and diet pill use (aOR 3.3, 95\% CI 1.6-6.9).
   CONCLUSIONS
   More than 4\% of public high school students in Massachusetts meet the
   federal definition of homelessness. These students are at high risk for
   disordered weight-control behaviors. Policy decisions at the school,
   state, and federal levels should make a concerted effort to target these
   students with social services and nutritional interventions.}},

   childhood obesity}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Primary prevention of childhood overweight is an
   international priority. In Australia 20-25\% of 2-8 year olds are
   already overweight. These children are at substantially increased the
   risk of becoming overweight adults, with attendant increased risk of
   morbidity and mortality. Early feeding practices determine infant
   exposure to food (type, amount, frequency) and include responses (eg
   coercion) to infant feeding behaviour (eg. food refusal). There is
   correlational evidence linking parenting style and early feeding
   practices to child eating behaviour and weight status. A focus on early
   feeding is consistent with the national focus on early childhood as the
   foundation for life-long health and well being. The NOURISH trial aims
   to implement and evaluate a community-based intervention to promote
   early feeding practices that will foster healthy food preferences and
   intake and preserve the innate capacity to self-regulate food intake in
   young children.
   Methods/Design: This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to recruit
   820 first-time mothers and their healthy term infants. A consecutive
   sample of eligible mothers will be approached postnatally at major
   maternity hospitals in Brisbane and Adelaide. Initial consent will be
   for re-contact for full enrolment when the infants are 4-7 months old.
   Individual mother-infant dyads will be randomised to usual care or the
   intervention. The intervention will provide anticipatory guidance via
   two modules of six fortnightly parent education and peer support group
   sessions, each followed by six months of regular maintenance contact.
   The modules will commence when the infants are aged 4-7 and 13-16 months
   to coincide with establishment of solid feeding, and autonomy and
   independence, respectively. Outcome measures will be assessed at
   baseline, with follow up at nine and 18 months. These will include
   infant intake (type and amount of foods), food preferences, feeding
   behaviour and growth and self-reported maternal feeding practices and
   parenting practices and efficacy. Covariates will include
   sociodemographics, infant feeding mode and temperament, maternal weight
   status and weight concern and child care exposure.
   Discussion: Despite the strong rationale to focus on parents' early
   feeding practices as a key determinant of child food preferences, intake
   and self-regulatory capacity, prospective longitudinal and intervention
   studies are rare. This trial will be amongst to provide Level II
   evidence regarding the impact of an intervention (commencing prior to
   age 12 months) on children's eating patterns and behaviours.

Abstract = {{Effects of diet on longevity are complex because acquired resources are
   shared among growth, reproduction and somatic maintenance. We simplify
   these axes by examining how dietary restriction and competitive contexts
   affect longevity using semelparous males of the Australian redback
   spider (Latrodectus hasselti). Plastic development of L. hasselti males
   results in trade-offs of body condition against faster development if
   females are present, facilitating scramble competition. In the absence
   of females, males develop slowly as high body condition adults, and are
   better equipped for mate searching. Here we focus on effects of diet and
   competitive context on body condition and longevity. Although male
   survival depended on body condition and exercise, contrary to studies in
   a wide range of taxa, dietary restriction did not increase longevity.
   However, there was an interactive effect of diet and competitive context
   on lifespan, because high-diet males reared in the absence of females
   lived longer than males reared in the presence of females. Thus males
   near females pay a survival cost of developing rapidly. This shows that
   life-history trade-offs affected by competitive context can impose
   longevity costs independent of the direct energy expenditure of
   searching, courtship, competition or reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in antipredation behavior should translate into variation in

   the primary behavioral correlate of survival, but when forced, by
   starvation risk, into areas where risk of attack is much higher,
   behaviors that reduce risk of capture once attacked should also promote
   survival. We found that reducing exposure to attack was most important
   for increasing survival and that increased vigilance and foraging
   success rate only increased survival for individuals that spent more
   time in high-risk areas. Use of the high-risk area and survival varied
   between years, suggesting that variation in starvation risk (i.e.,
   colder winters) may provide a mechanism for selection on

Abstract = {{The food available to coccinellid larvae and their exposure to predation
   is influenced by where they are placed as eggs. This review examines
   adult distribution and female oviposition strategies which in turn
   determine the distribution of coccinellid larvae in habitats.
   Immigration into a habitat can be influenced by visual and olfactory
   cues related to habitat quality. Adults are retained in a habitat if
   sufficient food resources are present. The abundance and quality of food
   in a habitat affects the reproductive output of a female and survival of
   larvae. Consequently. there is higher retention and oviposition
   preference for sites with abundant essential prey. Coccinellids also
   increase reproduction in response to non-prey foods (i.e., pollen), but
   avoid ovipositing in areas with copious amounts of honeydew. In
   laboratory studies, many plant-derived chemicals have been demonstrated
   to be attractants and oviposition stimulants. The need to place eggs in
   proximity to food for offspring must be weighed against the risk of
   cannibalism and intraguild predation. Lady beetles avoid egg predation
   by reducing oviposition where other adults are present, ovipositing on
   plants associated with less exposure or incidence of intraguild
   predation, and avoiding areas with tracks and frass of con- and
   heterospecific larvae. Indeed, deterrent cues for avoiding predation
   seem stronger than the positive ones associated with food. An
   understanding of the resources needed for successful reproduction and
   larval development in a habitat and the sensory cues that signal these
   resources, and thus elicit oviposition, may enhance our understanding of
   the underlying mechanisms affecting coccinellid distribution in
   habitats. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Fishes are often subjected to seasonal and spatial patchiness of food
   sources. We tested how risk-taking behaviour in the six-lined trumpeter,
   an estuarine seagrass resident fish, changed with hunger level in a
   laboratory experiment. When repeatedly offered a risky source of food,
   well-fed fish did not approach it and all fish survived over a one-month
   trial. In contrast, fish deprived of all food boldly first approached
   the risky food source after only a few days without food in some cases,
   or after many days in other cases, and then continued to approach risky
   food each time it was presented. Larger individuals were more bold (and
   had longer starvation endurance) than smaller ones, and after
   statistically controlling for these size effects, there were consistent
   individual differences in the propensity to take risks (i.e. boldness).
   These results show that food-and individual-dependent boldness will
   together affect vulnerability to predators and influence predation rates
   when resources become scarce.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in bold and shy personality on sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax
   were investigated between a population (wild) produced from wild-brood
   fish and a population (selected) produced from selected-brood fish.
   During the experiment (112 days), fish were reared under self-feeding
   condition to characterize the feeding behaviour of each individual fish.
   Three risk-taking tests (T1, T2 and T3 of 24 h with day-night
   alternation) were carried out at > 1 month intervals on 180 fish of each
   strain in order to monitor D. labrax behaviour over time and in relation
   to the light:dark period. A risk-taking score was evaluated via a
   preference choice between a safe zone (without food) and a risky zone
   (potentially with food) by recording the number and the duration of
   individual passages through an opening in an opaque divider. Results
   showed that fish performed passages preferentially during the night
   period and that wild fish were generally bolder than selected fish
   during T1 and T2 but showed a decrease in risk taking during T3,
   contrary to selected fish which showed a constant increase in their
   risk-taking behaviour. The phenotypic characteristics of the bold fish
   were different in the two strains: wild bold fish were the smallest
   within the wild strain and selected bold fish presented the higher
   growth rate within the selected strain. For both strains, these bold
   fish were also generally characterized by a high feed-demand activity.
   Fish hunger state thus seemed to be the highest motivation for
   risk-taking behaviour under the present conditions. Furthermore,
   behavioural variations over tests such as higher risk taking (number of
   passages) and faster exploratory responses (higher score emergence)
   could be interpreted as relevant indicators of the learning process and
   habituation. According to the results, however, no real difference in
   coping strategy between strains could be observed at this first stage of
   domestication and selection.}},

Abstract = {{Zooplankton accumulate several groups of photoprotective compounds to
   shield against damaging ultraviolet radiation (UV). One of these groups,
   the carotenoids, makes the animals more conspicuous to visually hunting
   predators, whereas others, such as the mycosporine-like amino acids
   (MAAs) may not. The blend of photoprotective compounds is therefore
   important for the UV defense but also for the ability to escape
   predation through crypsis. Here we assess laboratory and field data from
   different latitudes to examine how UV, predation threat, and pigment
   availability ( in food) affects the mixture of UV-protective compounds
   in copepods. Overall, the blend of MAAs and carotenoids was partly
   explained by the availability of MAAs in the food, the UV-threat, and
   the presence of predators. Copepods upregulated their MAA content when
   UV threat was increasing (i.e., if MAAs were abundant in food), and in
   field data this accumulation only occurred at high levels of predation
   threat. If MAAs were scarce, copepods instead compensated with higher
   carotenoid accumulation. However, when there was a high predation threat
   this carotenoid compensatory effect was disadvantageous, and low
   concentrations of both MAAs and carotenoids at high UV-threat resulted
   in lower reproduction. In all, these results showed that carotenoids and
   MAAs are complementary substances, i.e., one is high when the other is
   low, and copepods are, hence, able to adjust their blend of different
   UV-protective compounds to optimize their defenses to the threats of UV
   and predation. These defense systems may buffer against direct food-web
   interactions and help the zooplankton to survive in environments with
   high UV threat.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific latitudinal clines in the body size of terrestrial
   vertebrates, where members of the same species are larger at higher
   latitudes, are widely interpreted as evidence for natural selection and
   adaptation to local climate. These clines are predicted to shift in
   response to climate change. We used museum specimens to measure changes
   in the body size of eight passerine bird species from south-eastern
   Australia over approximately the last 100 years. Four species showed
   significant decreases in body size (1.8-3.6\% of wing length) and a
   shift in latitudinal cline over that period, and a meta-analysis
   demonstrated a consistent trend across all eight species. Southern
   high-latitude populations now display the body sizes typical of more
   northern populations pre-1950, equivalent to a 78 shift in latitude.
   Using ptilochronology, we found no evidence that these morphological
   changes were a plastic response to changes in nutrition, a likely
   non-genetic mechanism for the pattern observed. Our results demonstrate
   a generalized response by eight avian species to some major

Abstract = {{The identification of differentially regulated proteins in animal models

   of a mixture of labeled and unlabeled samples allows a sensitive and
   accurate comparative analysis between the respective proteomes. Here, we
   describe a cost-effective feeding protocol based on a newly developed
   N-15 bacteria diet based on Ralstonia eutropha protein, which was
   applied to a mouse model for trait anxiety. Tissue from N-15-labeled vs.
   N-14-unlabeled mice was examined by mass spectrometry and differences in
   the expression of glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) and histidine triad nucleotide
   binding protein 2 (Hint2) proteins were correlated with the animals'
   psychopathological behaviors for methodological validation and proof of
   concept, respectively. Additionally, phenotyping unraveled an
   antidepressant-like effect of the incorporation of the stable isotope
   N-15 into the proteome of highly anxious mice. This novel phenomenon is
   of considerable relevance to the metabolic labeling method and could
   provide an opportunity for the discovery of candidate proteins involved

Abstract = {{Ecological impacts of vehicle traffic are a significant environmental
   management issue on many sandy shores. Impacts usually focus on lethal
   effects of vehicles to organisms, but sub-lethal effects which could
   reduce the fitness of macrofauna populations are equally possible but
   unknown. Consequently, we measured changes in body condition and
   burrowing performance of the beach clam Donax deltoides subjected to
   vehicle traffic on sandy shores in eastern Australia, Body mass index of
   clams on beaches open to traffic was 16\% lower, but gonadosomatic index
   and relative valve thickness were not consistently linked to vehicle
   access to beaches. By contrast, off-road vehicles significantly impaired
   the burrowing performance of clams. After experimental exposure to ORV
   traffic (30 passes) and dislodgement from the sediment, the time taken
   for clams to re-bury into the sand doubled irrespective of the vehicle
   weight used. Because burrowing is such a critical function in the
   behavioural repertoire of sandy beach animals, the traffic-induced
   changes to organisms' performance found in this study may increase
   mortality by causing displacement to less favourable habitats by swash,
   and by intensifying the risk of predation and desiccation. When
   assessing the ecological impacts of vehicles on beach fauna, it is thus
   important to consider both lethal and sub-lethal effects. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Several species of seabirds show cyclic patterns of attendance at their

   of Cory's shearwater at three colonies (two oceanic and one located on
   the continental shelf), including the world's largest, at Selvagem
   Grande, Madeira, Portugal and considered several hypotheses concerning
   their causal mechanisms. At Selvagem Grande, cycles were exceptionally
   marked and regular, with a periodicity ranging from 7.8 to 11 days, and
   involved both breeders and nonbreeders. In contrast, variation in
   numbers was aperiodic at a nearby and much smaller colony (Selvagem
   Pequena), and also at the colony located off the Portuguese coast
   (Berlenga Island). We found no relationships between number of birds
   ashore and environmental variables such as wind direction and speed or
   lunar cycle. Cycles did not seem to be driven by oscillations in food
   availability or accessibility, given that they did not correlate with
   daily chick growth rates (which were acyclic) or diet. Despite their
   regularity, cycles were slightly out of phase in different sectors of
   Selvagem Grande, which suggests that social interactions at the colony
   could act as an entrainment agent for an endogenous rhythm, and so
   cycles are probably more likely to occur in large and dense colonies.
   Observations are consistent with the hypothesis that cycles facilitate
   social interactions by maximizing the probability of encounters at the
   colony. However, the exact mechanisms through which these remarkable
   cycles are controlled are still completely unknown, and clearly further

Abstract = {{Exhausted Literature. The Emergence of the New in Samuel Beckett's
   Novels and Plays. The article investigates literary subjectivity in some
   texts by Samuel Beckett. The article proceeds by relating the ways of
   how narration and speech acts constitute literary subjectivity to the
   problems of subjectivity that scientific investigations deal with. While
   successful self-regulation of the organism nourishes the roots of
   subjectivity, i.e. the habits, subjectivity decomposes in states of
   exhaustion, when self-regulation breaks down. As soon as a certain
   threshold is transgressed, fatigue sets in, alters the personality and
   eventually leads to exhaustion - a state, which psychiatrists compare to
   mental illness. Notwithstanding the different explanations given,
   scientists agreed about the effects of exhaustion. According to their
   investigations, the decomposition of personality by exhaustion generally
   does not involve apathy, withdrawal from activity or termination of
   movements, but rather mere action. Similarly, in Beckett's novels and
   plays exhaustion is much more than tiredness, as French philosopher
   Gilles Deleuze observed. For Beckett, exhaustion is rather the model for
   both literary innovation and a new concept of subjectivity, which lie
   explores on the basis of a detailed knowledge of physiology, psychology,
   and psychiatry, but using his own literary means. The exhausted subject
   is beyond any calculus of activity. It will perform an activity even if
   he or she makes mistakes or loses control, and will thus act in an
   unpredictable way. This unpredictable action is not an exception in the
   continuation of the habits, but rather points to the moment when a new
   subjectivity emerges. Such new subjectivity surfaces in Beckett's novels
   and plays in forms of literary innovation.}},

Abstract = {{A major question in the biology of stress and environmental adaptation
   concerns the neurobiological basis of how neuroendocrine systems
   governing physiological regulatory mechanisms essential for life
   (metabolism, immune response, organ function) become harmful. The
   current view is that a switch from protection to damage occurs when
   vulnerable phenotypes are exposed to adverse environmental conditions.
   In accordance with this theory, sequelae of early life social and
   environmental stressors, such as childhood abuse, neglect, poverty, and
   poor nutrition, have been associated with the emergence of mental and
   physical illness (i.e., anxiety, mood disorders, poor impulse control,
   psychosis, and drug abuse) and an increased risk of common metabolic and
   cardiovascular diseases later in life. Evidence from animal and human
   studies investigating the associations between early life experiences
   (including parent-infant bonding), hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
   activity, brain development, and health outcome provide important clues
   into the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the contribution of
   stressful experiences to personality development and the manifestation
   of illness. This review summarizes our current molecular understanding
   of how early environment influences brain development in a manner that
   persists through life and highlights recent evidence from rodent studies
   suggesting that maternal care in the first week of postnatal life
   establishes diverse and stable phenotypes in the offspring through
   epigenetic modification of genes expressed in the brain that shape
   neuroendocrine and behavioral stress responsivity throughout life. Birth

Abstract = {{Leaf biomechanical properties are thought to impose a significant
   obstacle to herbivores and as such influence patterns of herbivory more
   than leaf chemistry. However, evidence for the role of structural traits
   in influencing herbivore food choice and performance has come from
   correlative studies, whereas the underlying mechanisms have been given
   little attention. By manipulating the biomechanical properties of a host
   grass species through a combination of lyophilization and milling, and
   providing water separately, we were able to compare behavioral,
   physiological, and developmental responses of the Australian plague
   locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, to the biomechanical properties of
   plant food ( exemplified by toughness) independently of the food's
   macronutrient content and the insect's demand for water. Increasing leaf
   toughness was associated with reduced rates of locust growth and
   prolonged development, with potential ecological consequences. Poorer
   performance on the tougher foods was primarily a consequence of a
   reduced rate of nutrient supply, which occurred as a result of ( 1)
   smaller meals being eaten more slowly, ( 2) slowed gut passage rates,
   which limited how quickly the next meal could be taken, and ( 3) reduced
   efficiency of assimilation of nutrients from food in the gut. In
   addition, there were deleterious changes in the ratio of protein to
   carbohydrate assimilated from the gut. Prolonged development time was
   associated with increased total nutrient demands throughout the extended
   developmental period. Because these demands could not be met by
   increased consumption, there was a decreased efficiency of conversion of
   assimilated nutrients to growth. By disentangling the effects of
   biomechanical properties from macronutrient and water content we have
   shown that leaf biomechanical traits can influence chewing herbivores
   independently of leaf chemical traits.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. For phenotypically plastic organisms to produce phenotypes that are
   well matched to their environment, they must acquire information about
   their environment. For inducible defences, cues from damaged prey and
   cues from predators both have the potential to provide important
   information, yet we know little about the relative importance of these
   separate sources of information for behavioural and morphological
   defences. We also do not know the point during a predation event at
   which kairomones are produced, i.e. whether they are produced
   constitutively, during prey attack or during prey digestion.
   2. We exposed leopard frog tadpoles (Rana pipiens) to nine predator cue
   treatments involving several combinations of cues from damaged
   conspecifics or heterospecifics, starved predators, predators only
   chewing prey, predators only digesting prey or predators chewing and
   digesting prey.
   3. We quantified two behavioural defences. Tadpole hiding behaviour was
   induced only by cues from crushed tadpoles. Reduced tadpole activity was
   induced only by cues from predators digesting tadpoles or predators
   chewing + digesting tadpoles.
   4. We also quantified tadpole mass and two size-adjusted morphological
   traits that are known to be phenotypically plastic. Mass was unaffected
   by the cue treatments. Relative body length was affected (i.e. there
   were differences among some treatments), but none of the treatments
   significantly differed from the no-predator control. Relative tail depth
   was affected by the treatments and deeper tails were induced only when
   tadpoles were exposed to cues from predators digesting tadpoles or cues
   from predators chewing + digesting tadpoles.
   5. These results demonstrate that some prey species can discriminate
   among a diverse set of potential cues from heterospecific prey,
   conspecific prey and predators. Moreover, the results illustrate that
   the cues responsible for the full suite of behavioural and morphological
   defences are not induced by tadpole crushing nor can they be induced by
   generalized digestive chemicals produced when predators digest their
   prey. Instead, both prey damage and predator digestion of conspecific
   tissues appear to be important for communicating predatory risk to
   phenotypically plastic anuran prey. Importantly, the production of
   chemical cues by predators may be unavoidable and prey have evolved the
   ability to eavesdrop on these signals.}},

Abstract = {{Successful invasions are attributed to a combination of adaptations to
   biotic and abiotic conditions and many studies have highlighted the role

   habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence indicates that the development of the fetus is heavily
   influenced by the intra-uterine milieu during pregnancy, and that such
   influence may have life-long consequences for the individual. The
   intra-uterine milieu is not only influenced by nutritional factors, but
   also by maternal endocrine and autonomic activity. Such activity is
   prone to be affected by an individual's personality, but only little is
   known about influences of maternal personality on the development of the
   fetus. We tested pregnant women for their propensity for impulsive,
   uncontrollable outbursts of temper (referred to here as moderate
   Intermittent Explosive Disorder, mIED). After the women gave birth, we
   measured electrocardiograms (ECGs) from their newborn infants to compare
   ECGs between newborns of women with and without mIED. The data show that
   infants of women with mIED have larger QRS complexes in the
   electrocardiogram, and lower heart rate variability, compared to infants
   of women without mIED. These results reveal effects of maternal mIED on
   the fetal heart development. These effects may predispose the individual
   to increased risk for later cardio-vascular disease. The findings open
   perspectives for better risk prevention models for the unborn child. (C)

Abstract = {{The present study was designed to examine possible anxiolytic profile of
   aqueous fruit extracts of a medicinal plant Sea buckthorn (Hippophae
   rhamnoides L. spp. Turkestanica) in experimental animal models. Sea
   buckthorn (SBT) is a very potent medicinal and multipurpose plant which
   has gained global significance due to its biochemical and nutritional
   utility in folk medicine. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine with CNS
   depressant properties and a sedative-hypnotic drug traditionally used to
   treat anxiety. Animal models for anxiety-related behavior are based on
   the assumption that anxiety in animals is comparable to anxiety in
   humans. To unravel neurobiological mechanisms underlying normal anxiety
   as well as its pathological variations, animal models are indispensable
   tools. In this investigation rats were treated with the aqueous fruit
   extracts of Sea buckthorn (SBT-FE) (20 and 40 mg/kg P.O.) and diazepam
   at doses of 3.0mg/kg I.P. 1 hr before introducing the groups of animals
   to various experimental models of anxiety. Anti anxiety activity was
   evaluated using elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark model (LDM) and
   open field test (OFT). Results revealed that in elevated plus maze,
   treatment with aqueous extracts of SBT-FE increased the time spent in
   open arm and total locomotion time in aversive environment. In
   light-dark model treatment with these extracts showed significant
   (p<0.01) increases in time spent in lit-box and in open field test
   treatment with SBT-FE exhibited significant increases in the exploratory
   activity and latency time as compared to controls. The results indicate
   that aqueous SBT-FE is an effective anxiolytic agent and could be useful

Abstract = {{Alcohol addiction is a common affliction with a strong genetic component
   {[}1]. Although mammalian studies have provided significant insight into
   the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol consumption {[}2], other
   organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are better suited for
   unbiased, forward genetic approaches to identify novel genes. Behavioral
   responses to ethanol, such as hyperactivity, sedation, and tolerance,
   are conserved between files and mammals {[}3, 4], as are the underlying
   molecular pathways {[}5-9]. However, few studies have investigated
   ethanol self-administration in flies {[}10]. Here we characterize
   ethanol consumption and preference in Drosophila. Files prefer to
   consume ethanol-containing food over regular food, and this preference
   increases over time. Files are attracted to the smell of ethanol, which
   partially mediates ethanol preference, but are averse to its taste.
   Preference for consuming ethanol is not entirely explained by attraction
   to either its sensory or caloric properties. We demonstrate that flies
   can exhibit features of alcohol addiction. First,flies self-administer
   ethanol to pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Second, flies will
   overcome an aversive stimulus in order to consume ethanol. Third, flies
   rapidly return to high levels of ethanol consumption after a period of
   imposed abstinence. Thus, ethanol preference in Drosophila provides a
   new model for studying aspects of addiction.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Social learning is predicted to be adaptive when independent learning is
   time-consuming, dangerous or difficult. For a naive individual
   confronted with an array of novel foods, determining the nutritional
   value of unfamiliar foods can be challenging, and an increased reliance
   on social learning would be favoured by selection. I investigated
   whether the multimodal display of food calling and tid-bitting by
   white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens adaptively biases chicks'
   intake of foods of different nutrient content via social learning.
   Ptarmigan were observed in California's Sierra Nevada alpine for two
   summer seasons. In 116 foraging bouts, I observed 100 instances of hen
   food calling (to six plant species) and 100 responses by chicks. The
   relative proportion of each plant species in the chicks' diet was
   significantly and positively related to the proportion of food calls
   associated with that plant species, but not with its relative
   availability. Plant species that elicited food calls by hens had
   significantly more protein than did random mixtures of plants or than
   did foods eaten by the hens that did not elicit food calls. Chicks of
   hens that often uttered calls consumed diets significantly higher in
   protein than did chicks of hens that rarely called. Preferences were
   maintained as chicks became older and foraged further from their
   mothers, and food calling ceased, indicating social learning. Hens' food
   calling biased chicks' diet choices, supporting the prediction that
   socially acquired information plays a prominent role when an animal is
   seeking a nutrient that is difficult to identify (protein). These
   findings are consistent with the interpretation that ptarmigan hens
   engage in teaching, but further studies are required before it can be
   stated conclusively that they teach their chicks nutritional wisdom. (C)

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Predators are often unwilling to eat prey with novel appearances (so
   called dietary conservatism). It has repeatedly, although
   controversially, been argued that such wariness can contribute to the
   evolution of bright coloration in prey animals with effective secondary
   defences such as toxins. In this paper we report the results of novel
   evolutionary simulations in which bright prey emerge in otherwise
   cryptic, defended populations, and predators vary in their level of
   dietary wariness. A novel prediction from our simulations is that rare
   aposematic prey can evolve to a dynamic equilibrium with their cryptic
   conspecifics, and persist for long evolutionary timescales without ever
   reaching fixation in prey populations. Furthermore, we show that when
   conditions are more beneficial for new aposematic forms, for example
   because there are many palatable prey in a habitat, then dietary
   conservatism can indeed explain the evolution of aposematism, but the
   generality of this result was considerably restricted by variation in
   levels of dietary conservatism seen within predator populations and by
   increased predator longevity. We use the results to consider the case
   that `receiver biases' could explain aposematism, rather than recently
   suggested models of signal reliability. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{153-158}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pit-building antlion larvae are sit-and-wait predatory insects that
   construct conical pits, from which they ambush prey, in sandy soils. We
   examined the behavioural responses of antlions to the detection of
   various sized prey, which they were not allowed to capture. We found
   that antlions responded faster to smaller prey items, probably because
   larger prey may be considered a source of disturbance rather than a food
   source. Antlion response time to provided prey decreased after feeding
   and was negatively correlated with antlion body mass. Both of these
   results were indicative of a response to prey that depended on both
   internal and external factors. Pit dimensions increased with time at a
   constant rate among antlions in the unsuccessful prey capture or fed
   groups, but at a decelerating rate in the unfed control group. Contrary
   to our expectation, we could not detect differences in the rate of mass
   loss between antlions that were unfed and those experiencing
   unsuccessful prey captures. We also posited that antlions should exploit
   a specific prey type more efficiently as the number of encounters they
   had with it increased. However, there was no support for this prediction
   in our study. Exploring the responses of predators to prey in general,
   and in light of the conditions characterizing their natural habitat in
   particular, can improve our understanding of how predators adapt to cope
   with environmental variability. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{165-171}},

Abstract = {{Under sexual conflict, males evolve traits to increase their mating and
   reproductive success that impose costs on females. Females evolve
   counteradaptations to resist males and reduce those costs. Sexual
   harassment is a form of sexual conflict in which males make repeated,
   costly attempts to mate. Costs to female foraging or predation risk have
   been measured in several species, but quantitative measurements of
   direct fitness costs are rare. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile
   rotundata (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), males harass females,
   and females resist all mating attempts. We placed bees in large, outdoor
   cages with various male-biased sex ratios. Harassment rate, nest
   progression, offspring production, temperature, and food availability
   were measured daily for 7 days. Harassment rates were highest at
   intermediate sex ratios. Harassment reduced the number of foraging trips
   and increased the duration of foraging trips made by females. Females
   produced offspring at a slower rate when subjected to higher rates of
   harassment. This shows a direct link from sex ratio to harassment to
   female fitness under natural conditions. We also discuss an alternative
   explanation that female resistance is a mechanism for mate choice for
   high-quality males, which would require that indirect benefits accrue
   through either daughters or grandsons, because all sons in haplodiploid
   species arise from unfertilized eggs. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Although explanatory and predictive powers are 2 closely interconnected
   aspects of conceptual and mathematical models of complex systems, the
   two are not equivalent. The 2 aspects are discussed here for the
   microbial part of photic zone food webs of the marine pelagic. We focus
   on the specific question of how limiting nutrients are transferred from
   the dissolved form, through the microbial food web, to mesozooplankton.
   For this purpose, 5 different nutrient addition experiments are reviewed
   and compared to a `simplest possible' conceptual food web model. The
   experiments range in scale from artificial food webs constructed in
   laboratory chemostats, via mesocosm experiments, to a Lagrangian
   open-ocean addition experiment and cover time scales from days to weeks.
   We conclude that main system responses in all cases can be explained
   within the framework of the simple model, and that each experiment
   therefore also adds credibility to the basic concepts of this model.
   However, different system attributes profoundly affect the pathway and
   speed of nutrient transfer in each experiment. A re-occurring theme
   seems to be how the interactions between flexible stoichiometry and
   predatory processes modify experimental outcomes. Understanding the
   flexibility in the behavior of the system has thus increased with each
   experiment, but the requirement for new ad hoc assumptions to be added
   to the basic model structure in each case makes reliable predictions of
   the experimental outcome appear only possible with further model
   elaboration.}},

Abstract = {{Birds use local environmental Cues to fine-tune the timing of egg laying

   phenology are often considered the most likely Cues, but no previous

   We used confirmatory path analyses and a long-term study of Blue Tits
   (Cyanistes caeruleus) to identify and measure the relative weighting of
   the causal paths that link laying date to spring phenology and
   temperature in deciduous and evergreen oak forests on Corsica. Path
   analysis showed that the effects of temperature and vegetation phenology
   vary between forest types and season. In deciduous oak forest, where
   females lay eggs early in spring, phenology of vegetation or insects
   sets the laying date. In evergreen oak forest, where breeding occurs
   later in the season, females shift from a predominantly phenology-based
   Cue system to a predominantly temperature-based Cue system. This
   plasticity in the decision process allows birds to minimize the risk of
   mismatching breeding date with the optimal time window and may be
   critical in allowing birds to track human-induced environmental change.

Abstract = {{Intermittent locomotion, characterized by moves interspersed with
   pauses, is a common pattern of locomotion in animals, but its ecological
   and evolutionary significance relative to continuous locomotion remains
   poorly understood. Although many studies have examined individual
   differences in both intermittent locomotion and boldness separately, to
   our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship
   between these 2 traits. Characterizing and understanding this
   relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are
   associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as
   foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we
   report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and
   intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in
   field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our
   results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level
   variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and
   labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with
   differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals
   spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses
   than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was
   correlated with body size or body condition. This study provides the

Abstract = {{Animals can reduce their uncertainty of predation risk by attuning to

   Although it has never been empirically examined in the context of

   Canada to stimuli simulating a range of predation risk situations. We
   presented individuals with social cues in the form of playbacks of
   black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mob-calls conveying graded
   information about predator size in combination with a predator model
   (one of two owl species) that rendered the social information either
   correct or incorrect. The response did not differ based on migratory
   state; both migrant and resident birds stayed longer at experimental
   trials when presented with erroneous social information. In particular,
   response duration of birds presented with a low-threat chickadee
   mob-call and a high-threat model (understating the risk) was
   substantially longer than the response to other low-threat call trials,

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{147}},

Pages = {{883-897}},
Abstract = {{Learning is a ubiquitous phenomenon in foraging animals, allowing
   behavioural optimisation in variable environments. Food imprinting is a
   specific form of learning restricted to the early stages of life and
   with long lasting consequences. However, since coining of the term four
   decades ago, the uniqueness of food imprinting has been largely
   questioned due to a putative mechanistic similarity with associative
   learning. Here, we demonstrate food imprinting in the predatory mite
   Neoseiulus californicus, which primarily feeds on spider mites but may
   use thrips as alternative prey. Brief (24 h) exposure to thrips (contact
   without feeding) early in life resulted in shorter attack latencies and
   consistently higher predation rates on thrips during adulthood.
   Predation and oviposition rates were positively correlated but
   oviposition did not differ between naive and experienced females. Our
   results suggest that food imprinting is indeed special because, unlike
   associative learning, it occurred without reinforcement, was restricted
   to a sensitive phase and persisted into adulthood. Food imprinting seems
   particularly advantageous when prey species availability varies little
   within generations and a given prey is difficult to ingest for young
   small but not older larger life stages. Food imprintability could be
   used to improve the efficacy of biocontrol agents such as N.
   californicus.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Extremely low body mass index (BMI) values are associated
   with increased risk for death and poor long-term prognosis in
   individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). The present study explores
   childhood personality characteristics that could be associated with the
   ability to attain an extremely low BMI.
   Methods: Participants were 326 women from the Genetics of Anorexia
   Nervosa (GAN) Study who completed the Structured Interview for Anorexia
   Nervosa and Bulimic Syndromes and whose mother completed the Child
   Behavioral Checklist and/or Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey.
   Results: Children who were described as having greater fear or anxiety
   by their mothers attained lower BMIs during AN (p < 0.02). Path analysis
   in the CAN and a validation sample, Price Foundation Anorexia Nervosa
   Trios Study, confirmed the relation between early childhood anxiety,
   caloric restriction, qualitative food item restriction, excessive
   exercise, and low BMI. Path analysis also confirmed a relation between
   childhood anxiety and caloric restriction, which mediated the relation
   between childhood anxiety and low BMI in the GAN sample only.
   Conclusion: Fearful or anxious behavior as a child was associated with
   the attainment of low BMI in AN and childhood anxiety was associated
   with caloric restriction. Measures of anxiety and factors associated
   with anxiety-proneness in childhood may index children at risk for
   restrictive behaviors and extremely low BMIs in AN. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-105}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{P>Basal termites possess two developmental features that eusocial
   Hymenoptera lack: the majority of colony members are juveniles whose
   somatic and reproductive development is temporarily or permanently
   suspended, and individual development is characterized by extreme
   phenotypic plasticity. An examination of the literature indicates that
   the basis for these unique ontogenetic characters is not the
   prolongation of a pronymphal stage into postembryonic development, as
   recently suggested. Like other hemimetabolous insects, termites have
   three embryonic cuticles, and the pronymphal (EC3) cuticle is shed
   during or shortly after hatch. Nonetheless, a different developmental
   landmark, dorsal closure, occurs later during embryogenesis in termites
   than it does in their cockroach relatives, clearly indicating
   ontogenetic repatterning from an ancestral state. An alternate
   hypothesis for the origin of isopteran phenotypic plasticity becomes
   apparent if we remain focused on the phylogenetic and social context of
   termite evolution. Altricial development occurs in both vertebrate and
   invertebrate taxa, evolves in response to the parental environment, and
   is displayed by two distantly related, biparental, wood-feeding
   cockroaches, including Cryptocercus, the sister-group to termites. It is
   therefore likely the condition was present in subsocial termite
   ancestors, and played a complex, multidimensional role in the transition
   to eusociality. Most relevant to current arguments is that a shift in
   responsibility for the care of altricial dependents, from parents to the
   first nutritionally independent nymphs in the family (alloparents),
   resulted in the developmental stasis of alloparents at a relatively
   young age. Because early instar cockroaches are not metamorphically
   competent, these young alloparents would have provided a novel
   developmental template on which selection could act.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The timing of many life history events shows phenotypic plasticity in
   response to the risk of predation. Theory predicts that increased risk
   of mortality in an early stage should select for switching earlier,
   while a higher risk after the transition should select for switching
   later. Here we examined the effects of stage-specific predation risk on
   the timing of hatching of Rana temporaria. Embryos were exposed to
   chemical cues from either an egg predator (Haemopis sanguisuda) or a
   tadpole predator (Aeshna cyanea) to evaluate three specific hypotheses:
   (1) a fixed intermediate response, (2) a `fixed predator' response
   (i.e., either anticipation or delay), and (3) a specific predator
   response (both anticipation and delay). Rana temporaria embryos did not
   discern between pre- and post-hatching specific predators, and they
   hatched prematurely regardless predator type. These results suggest that
   R. temporaria embryos respond to predation risk in a fixed way by
   hatching early, and that they use cues stemming from injured
   conspecifics, which provides a simple, conservative mechanism of risk
   assessment. In conclusion, our data are not anticipated by the
   theoretical consideration that organisms should spend less time in more
   dangerous environments, but they confirm an invariable adjustment of
   hatching time in response to an inscrutable predation risk (response to
   a fixed-predator) in connection with a consistent mechanism mediating
   the perception of predation risk.}},

   combination of the first method with a standard fitness measure.
   Performance is evaluated on the Santa Fe Trail, a well known GP

Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Epigenetic processes, primarily DNA methylation and covalent
   modifications of histones, regulate the transcriptional activity of
   genes in a manner that can be modified by environmental cues. This
   allows variation in the expression of the transcriptome without changes
   in the genome. Constraint in the early life environment, such as poor
   early nutrition, is associated with increased risk of non-communicable
   diseases, including cardio-metabolic disease and cancer in later life.
   Such induced phenotypic change involves environmental signals acting
   through developmental plasticity. Recent studies in humans and in animal
   models show that epigenetic processes, in particular DNA methylation,
   have a central role in the induction and stability of novel phenotypes
   and in increased disease risk. Identification of such processes suggests
   the potential for developing biomarkers of disease risk and for
   interventions to prevent or reverse the adverse effects of a poor early
   life environment. At present, knowledge in this area is limited to
   proof-of-principle studies in animal models and some initial studies in
   humans. Before such findings can be translated into reliable biomarkers
   and safe, effective interventions, several fundamental questions need to
   be answered. In order to achieve this, new technologies will be needed

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of
   unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women.
   They are characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior and
   weight regulation, and deviant attitudes and perceptions toward body
   weight and shape. In AN, an inexplicable fear of weight gain and
   unrelenting obsession with being fat, even in the face of increasing
   emaciation, accounts for a protracted course. BN usually emerges after a
   period of food restriction, which may or may not have been associated
   with weight loss. Binge eating is followed either by self-induced
   vomiting, or by other means of compensation for the excess of ingested
   food. There is growing acknowledgement that neurobiological
   vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to the pathogenesis of
   AN and BN, suggesting that altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function
   contributes to dysregulation of appetite, mood, and impulse control.
   Brain imaging studies, using 5-HT specific ligands, show that
   disturbances of 5-HT function occur when people are ill, and persist
   after recovery. It is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT
   neuronal modulation predates the onset of AN, and contributes to
   premorbid symptoms of anxiety, obsessionality and inhibition. This
   dysphoric temperament may involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional
   and reward pathways which also mediates the hedonic aspects of feeding,
   thus making these individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive
   behaviors. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary intake,
   by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which they can
   modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood. They enter a
   vicious cycle, because caloric restriction results in a brief respite
   from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn,
   produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function, which
   also exaggerates dysphoric mood. Thus, those with AN pursue starvation
   in an attempt to avoid the dysphoric consequences of eating.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is the process by which environmental cues in

   capacity for plasticity evolved because it allows the organism to

   plasticity operates over the normative range of environmental
   experiences. Studies of the long-term consequences of different
   developmental environments for human health and disease have shown that
   growth restriction (altered birth size) is not a prerequisite for
   altered disease risk and that there is a graded effect across the whole
   range of fetal milieu. Thus, the emerging consensus is that `fetal
   programming' reflects the maladaptive consequences of developmental
   plasticity, arising from discordance between the triggering and later
   environments. Such discordance is increasingly likely, both because of
   demographic shifts and because of the rapid change in the nutritional

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{407}},
Pages = {{173-185}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural traits can strongly influence fitness and survival and are
   important mediators of life history trade-offs. This study explored the
   links between mortality trade-offs associated with fast growth during
   larval life and behaviour of individuals during an important life
   history transition. Longitudinal sampling of a cohort of damselfish
   settling on a reef at the end of their larval stage found that
   individuals with small otolith sizes at hatching and low otolith growth
   rates were selectively removed from the local population, while there
   was no apparent selection for size or body condition over the first 24 h
   after settlement. Selection against slow growth (initial larval growth
   and maximum growth) and small size at hatching and settlement were
   accentuated over the first month after settlement. Detailed behavioural
   assessments of naive larvae settled onto habitat patches and monitored
   for 24 h found that initial boldness aided survival, but individuals
   that ventured larger distances from shelter suffered higher mortality.
   Correlations of growth with behavioural attributes were generally poor;
   however, there was a weak correlation between boldness and maximum
   growth. A measure of flexibility in the maximum distance ventured from
   shelter was positively related to initial otolith growth. Our results
   suggest that although early growth which is relatively slow leads to
   higher mortality later in life, and behavioural attributes influenced
   survival, there were only weak correlations between growth history and
   behaviour. This may be due to strong selective pressures on young fish
   to learn novel behaviours rapidly after settlement. Selection may
   promote behavioural flexibility at this key ecological transition.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{415}},
Pages = {{83-90}},
Abstract = {{Sessile colonial invertebrates that must tolerate environmental
   variation without the luxury of mobility may be expected to cope with
   such variation through phenotypic plasticity. While plastic responses to
   a range of biotic factors (e.g. predation) are increasingly documented,
   the details of responses to competition (mediated by the densities of
   conspecifics or heterospecifics vying for the same resources) remain
   unclear, despite a rich literature for terrestrial plants on which to
   draw. We examined phenotypic responses to conspecific density in a
   colonial invertebrate (the arborescent bryozoan, Bugula neritina) under
   field conditions. We found that colonies at higher densities were
   generally less fecund, lower in biomass and more elongate than those
   growing virtually alone. We also found such responses to vary only
   subtly with the life history stage of neighbours, with colonies exposed
   to higher densities of contemporary recruits achieving elongation via
   increased budding between bifurcation points and the elongation of
   individual zooids, while colonies exposed to established adults achieved
   elongation via increased budding only. These responses are broadly
   consistent with those of terrestrial plants competing for light and are
   probably due to the combined effects of resource limitation and altered
   flow in high density stands. Future studies are needed to disentangle
   these effects and the extent to which such responses to density in
   branching colonial invertebrates are a passive result of food
   limitation, or reflect active (and potentially adaptive) plasticity to
   other aspects of the local density environment.}},

Abstract = {{The present article presents epidemiological, and comparative evidence
   Supporting the hypothesis that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may represent a
   thrifty adaptation selected to compel animals to minimize voluntary
   energy expenditure. The autoimmune, pathophysiological manifestations
   underlying RA are framed here as constituting an evolved, protective
   mechanism that would have influenced animals to avoid exertion and
   maintain a sedentary lifestyle in order to minimize metabolic output and
   ultimately escape starvation. Arthritic pain is characterized here as a
   defensive, innate signal much like fatigue, fever, nausea and reflexive
   pain, and like these, is seen on a continuum varying between
   imperceptible encumbrance and debilitating disability. The epigenetic
   relationship between acute psychological stress and flare-up of
   arthritic symptoms is examined and taken to suggest that arthritis may
   be a predictive, adaptive response to severe stress allowing reductions
   in metabolism to follow adverse conditions or nutritional scarcity. The
   close associations between rheumatoid arthritis and the metabolic
   syndrome are also explored along with potential ties to the ``thrifty
   genotype{''} and ``thrifty phenotype{''} phenomena. This hypothesis is
   examined in the contexts of evolutionary medicine, phenotypic
   plasticity, the stress response and the bioenergetics of thrift. A brief
   and exploratory review of pertinent evidence suggests that RA, its
   subclinical manifestations, and even other forms of arthropathy may

Abstract = {{Within a season, successive generations of short-lived organisms
   experience different combinations of environmental parameters, such as
   temperature, food quality and mortality risk. Adult body size of e.g.
   insects is therefore expected to vary both as a consequence of proximate
   environmental effects as well as adaptive responses to seasonal cues. In
   this study, we examined intraspecific differences in body size between
   successive generations in 12 temperate bivoltine moths (Lepidoptera),
   with the ultimate goal to critically compare the role of proximate and
   adaptive mechanisms in determining seasonal size differences. In nearly
   all species, individuals developing late in the season (diapausing
   generation) attained a larger adult size than their conspecifics with
   the larval period early in the season (directly developing generation)
   despite the typically lower food quality in late summer. Rearing
   experiments conducted on one of the studied species, Selenia
   tetralunaria also largely exclude the possibility that the proximate
   effects of food quality and temperature are decisive in determining size
   differences between successive generations. Adaptive explanations appear
   likely instead: the larger body size in the diapausing generation may be
   adaptively associated with the lower bird predation pressure late in the
   season, and/or the likely advantage of large pupal size during
   overwintering.}},

Abstract = {{Recent climate change has caused diverse ecological responses in plants
   and animals. However, relatively little is known about homeothermic
   animals' ability to adapt to changing temperature regimes through
   changes in body size, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We used
   fluctuations in mean annual temperatures in south-west Germany since
   1972 in order to look for direct links between temperature and two
   aspects of body size: body mass and flight feather length. Data from
   regionally born juveniles of 12 passerine bird species were analysed.
   Body mass and feather length varied significantly among years in eight
   and nine species, respectively. Typically the inter-annual changes in
   morphology were complexly non-linear, as was inter-annual variation in
   temperature. For six (body mass) and seven species (feather length),
   these inter-annual fluctuations were significantly correlated with
   temperature fluctuations. However, negative correlations consistent with
   Bergmann's rule were only found for five species, either for body mass
   or feather length. In several of the species for which body mass and
   feather length was significantly associated with temperature,
   morphological responses were better predicted by temperature data that
   were smoothed across multiple years than by the actual mean breeding
   season temperatures of the year of birth. This was found in five species
   for body mass and three species for feather length. These results
   suggest that changes in body size may not merely be the result of
   phenotypic plasticity but may hint at genetically based
   microevolutionary adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock systems are characterised by limited input. In such
   systems animal food requirements are mainly based on grazing. Vegetation
   varies in terms of space and time, and is heterogeneous and sensitive to
   climatic changes. The low control by the breeders on the immediate
   environment implies that the management of extensive systems in such a
   context mainly depends on the adaptive ability of the animals. They have
   to be able to fulfill their food requirements by developing specific
   behaviours such as land exploration and selective intake. They also have
   to cope with low feed intake periods of various intensities and
   duration.
   In this paper we demonstrate that herbivores adjust their behaviour and
   physiological responses to cope with their environment and face
   constraints. Such adjustments highlight the differences between breeds

Abstract = {{With almost 80\% of the fighting forces composed of child soldiers, this
   is one characterization of the `new wars,' which constitute the dominant
   form of violent conflict that has emerged only over the last few
   decades. The development of light weapons, such as automatic guns
   suitable for children, was an obvious prerequisite for the involvement
   of children in modern conflicts that typically involve irregular forces,
   that target mostly civilians, and that are justified by identities,
   although the economic interests of foreign countries and exiled
   communities are usually the driving force.
   Motivations for child recruitment include children's limited ability to
   assess risks, feelings of invulnerability, and shortsightedness. Child
   soldiers are more often killed or injured than adult soldiers on the
   front line. They are less costly for the respective group or
   organization than adult recruits, because they receive fewer resources,
   including less and smaller weapons and equipment. From a different
   perspective, becoming a fighter may seem an attractive possibility for
   children and adolescents who are facing poverty, starvation,
   unemployment, and ethnic or political persecution. In our interviews,
   former child soldiers and commanders alike reported that children are
   more malleable and adaptable. Thus, they are easier to indoctrinate, as
   their moral development is not yet completed and they tend to listen to
   authorities without questioning them.
   Child soldiers are raised in an environment of severe violence,
   experience it, and subsequently often commit cruelties and atrocities of
   the worst kind. This repeated exposure to chronic and traumatic stress
   during development leaves the children with mental and related physical
   ill-health, notably PTSD and severe personality}},

Title = {{Can translocations be used to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{428-439}},
Abstract = {{Growing public concerns about lethal methods to mitigate human-wildlife
   conflicts place increasing constraints on wildlife management options.
   Translocations, perceived as humane and non-lethal solutions, are
   increasingly advocated to resolve these conflicts. The present study
   summarises the literature on translocations of wild mammals, with
   particular emphasis on `problem' animals, reviews the impact of
   translocations on survival, behaviour, animal welfare and potential
   spread of diseases, and evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of
   translocations to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. Translocations may
   have a detrimental impact on survival rates and lead to extreme
   dispersal movements. In some species, stress-related capture results in
   substantial mortality. In other species, homing causes animals to leave
   the release area. In addition, some animals resume the nuisance
   behaviour at the release site. Individuals that survive a translocation
   may suffer from malnutrition, dehydration, decreased immunocompetence
   and predation. Supportive measures such as acclimatisation pens and
   provision of food and shelter can drastically reduce post-release
   dispersal movements and mortality, although the adoption of these
   measures increases the cost of translocation. Translocations have the
   potential to spread diseases to conspecifics, humans, domestic animals
   and livestock. Health surveillance, seldom implemented, is likely to add
   significantly to the cost of translocation. Very few studies have
   reported the costs of translocations or addressed which stakeholders are
   expected to pay for translocating problem animals. Alternative
   management options are rarely mentioned. Despite the perceived
   humaneness of translocations to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, the
   fate of translocated animals has been rarely monitored. In addition,
   very few studies have mentioned whether and for how long the conflict
   was resolved. We suggest that determining whether the translocation
   leads to the resolution of the problem should be the main criterion to
   evaluate the success of the translocation of problem animals. We propose
   a list of criteria to assist decisions regarding the suitability,
   effectiveness and humaneness of translocations to manage problems posed
   by wild mammals.}},

Abstract = {{While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in
   recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the
   outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In
   particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality
   differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of
   male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual
   differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank,
   which partially determines mating success in this species. The
   expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female
   courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number
   of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of
   courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65,
   respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating
   context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of
   mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males
   showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in
   the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither
   behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or
   body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in
   the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural
   phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than
   short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food
   or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or

Abstract = {{Olfactory cues that indicate predation risk elicit a number of defensive
   behaviors in fishes, but whether they are sufficient to also induce

   characterized by a high level of morphological plasticity during
   development, and the few species that have been tested do exhibit
   defensive behaviors when exposed to alarm cues released from the damaged
   skin of conspecifics. We utilized young juvenile Nicaragua cichlids
   Hypsophrys nicaraguensis to test if the perception of predation risk
   from alarm cue (conspecific skin extract) alone induces an increased
   relative body depth which is a defense against gape-limited predators.
   After two weeks of exposure, siblings that were exposed to conspecific
   alarm cue increased their relative body depth nearly double the amount
   of those exposed to distilled water (control) and zebrafish Danio rerio
   alarm cue. We repeated our measurements over the last two weeks (12 and
   14) of cue exposure when the fish were late-stage juveniles to test if
   the rate of increase was sustained; there were no differences in final
   dimensions between the three treatments. Our results show that 1) the
   Nicaragua cichlid has an innate response to conspecific alarm cue which
   is not a generalized response to an injured fish, and 2) this innate
   recognition ultimately results in developing a deeper body at a stage of
   the life history where predation risk is high {[}Current Zoology 56(1):

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{593-600}},

Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions are usually composed of behaviorally
   sophisticated games in which the values of the strategies of foraging
   prey individuals may depend on those of their predators, and vice versa.
   Therefore, any change in the behavior of the predator should result in
   changes to the behavior of the prey. However, this key prediction has
   rarely been tested. To examine the effects of the predator state on prey
   behavior, we manipulated the state of captive Barn Owls, Tyto alba, and
   released them into an enclosure containing Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus
   andersoni allenbyi, a common prey of the owls. The owls were
   significantly more active when hungry. In response, the gerbils altered
   their behavior according to the state of the owl. When the owl was
   hungry, the gerbils visited fewer food patches, foraged in fewer
   patches, and harvested less food from each patch. Moreover, the gerbils
   kept their foraging bouts closer to their burrow, which reduced the
   overlap among foraging ranges of individual gerbils. Thus, changes in
   the state of the predator affect the foraging behavior of its prey and
   can also mediate competition among prey individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic charr are characterized by an extensive variability in growth and
   body size in natural waters. Although growth traits may involve a
   significant heritable component, most of this intraspecific variation
   presumably is environmentally induced and thus attributable to
   phenotypic plasticity. In the present study, size-at-age and
   length-weight relationship (body condition) were assessed for three
   Finnish Arctic charr populations of different geographical origins and
   extreme size forms (a stunted vs. two large-growing, predatory charr)
   held under standardized rearing conditions for 3 years (up to 37 months
   after hatching). In particular, our interest was to investigate whether
   the differences in growth between the large and the stunted charr as
   observed in the wild populations would diminish when the fish are
   offered suitable food in abundance. Population-specific mean body size
   and condition differed significantly in 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ fish. However,
   the identical rearing conditions resulted in the originally stunted
   charr reaching a comparable final mean size (317 mm/427 g) as the large
   charr populations (343 mm/510 g and 359 mm/497 g). Some individuals were
   of the same size as their parents at spawning already at the age of 0+
   years. Furthermore, length-weight regression residuals of the stunted
   charr developed to a notably high level, indicating the largest final
   condition mean. The increase of size variation (CV of weight) in stunted
   charr lasted for over two growth seasons, whereas in large charr it
   remained stable since the end of the first summer. Variations in
   mortality and sexual maturation at age 2 seemed to be less relevant
   factors affecting overall growth performance. The study demonstrates an
   example of the high plasticity involved in the growth of fish: the
   stunted charr possess a tremendous capacity for growth in a benign
   environment, virtually corresponding to that observed in the large
   predatory populations.}},

Abstract = {{1. The detrimental impacts of invasive, non-native species on islands
   are widely acknowledged and it is often best to act rapidly against such
   species, even where uncertainty exists over the best way to proceed. If
   management actions are evaluated and refined, using information learnt
   from the biology of culled animals, this uncertainty can be gradually
   reduced, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome.
   2. American mink Neovison vison carcasses were collected as part of an
   eradication campaign on several islands of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland,
   and stable isotope analysis was used to describe ecological variation in
   this invasive non-native predator.
   3. Isotope profiles from individual mink whiskers demonstrated how
   behaviour at a population level changed markedly over time. As the
   eradication campaign progressed, mink increased their reliance on marine
   food sources and focused their activity on the coastline. Stable isotope
   analyses also demonstrated sex-related changes in foraging and ranging
   behaviour in relation to food resource availability on the two main
   island complexes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings contribute to the refinement
   of a campaign to extend the successful eradication of mink from Uist and
   Harris, to the whole of the Outer Hebrides archipelago, UK. They also
   highlight the potential for stable isotope approaches to provide more
   detailed postmortem information that can inform adaptive management of

Abstract = {{The life history of freshwater cladocerans such as Daphnia spp. is
   strongly affected by their environment. Factors such as temperature,
   food quantity and even the presence or absence of predators influence
   growth, reproduction and morphology of individuals. Recently, it has
   also become clear that the quality of the food can affect various life
   history traits of Daphnia. More specifically, the effect of the
   elemental composition of algae, expressed as the C:P ratio, has been
   studied intensively. Daphnia species differ in their response to
   differences in the C:P ratio of their food. Until now, it has been
   unclear whether these species differences are driven by phylogenetic
   constraints or by adaptation to particular environmental conditions.
   Here we present laboratory experiments with 12 Daphnia species from
   three different subgenera originating from a broad range of habitats. We
   compared somatic growth rates and sensitivity to variation in the
   nutrient stoichiometry of the food with habitat parameters, taking into
   account the phylogenetic history of the species. No associations between
   fitness and habitat parameters were detected. However, we found a
   trade-off between sensitivity to P-deficient diets and the maximum
   growth rate on a P-sufficient diet. In several cases, this trade-off
   helps to explain the association between species distribution and
   habitat parameters. We observed no correlation of the sensitivity to P
   limitation with the phylogenetic history of the genus Daphnia. Thus, we
   conclude that the differential responses among Daphnia species to
   variation in P content in food were driven mainly by adaptations to
   their local habitats, and are not constrained by deep evolutionary
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Many organisms have evolved inducible defences in response to spatial
   and temporal variability in predation risk. These defences are assumed
   to incur large costs to prey; however, few studies have investigated the
   mechanisms and costs underlying these adaptive responses. I examined the
   proximate cause of predator-induced shell thickening in a marine snail
   (Nucella lamellosa) and tested whether induced thickening leads to an
   increase in structural strength. Results indicate that although
   predators (crabs) induce thicker shells, the response is a passive
   by-product of reduced feeding and somatic growth rather than an active
   physiological response to predation risk. Physical tests indicate that
   although the shells of predator-induced snails are significantly
   stronger, the increase in performance is no different than that of
   snails with limited access to food. Increased shell strength is
   attributable to an increase in the energetically inexpensive
   microstructural layer rather than to material property changes in the
   shell. This mechanism suggests that predator-induced shell defences may
   be neither energetically nor developmentally costly. Positive
   correlations between antipredator behaviour and morphological defences
   may explain commonly observed associations between growth reduction and
   defence production in other systems and could have implications for the
   evolutionary potential of these plastic traits.}},

Abstract = {{Personal food preferences can either enhance or Suppress the development
   of obesity and the selection and proportion of macronutrients in the
   diet seem to have a heritable component. In the present study, we
   therefore focused on dietary composition as a specific trait related to
   obesity and we determined whether genetic variations in leptin (LEP),
   LEP receptor (LEPR), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), IL-6 and pro-opiomelanocortin
   (POMC) underlie specific native food preferences and obesity-related
   anthropometric parameters. The total of 409 individuals of Czech
   Caucasian origin were enrolled into the present study and 7 d food
   records were obtained from the study subjects along with selected
   anthropometric measurements. In a subset of study subjects, plasma
   levels of ADIPOQ, LEP and soluble LEPR were measured. Independently of
   the BMI of the individuals, common variations in LEP and LEPR genes were
   associated with specific eating patterns, mainly with respect to timing
   of eating. The LEP + 19A/G polymorphism served as an independent
   predictor for BMI, percentage of body fat and skinfold thickness and
   significantly affected the time structure of the daily energy intake.
   The POMC RsaI polymorphism was associated with percentage of body fat.
   The ADIPOQ 45 T/G polymorphism was associated with the thickness of the
   subscapular skinfold. The LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism was associated
   with multiple parameters, including diastolic blood pressure, meal sizes
   during the day and plasma ADIPOQ levels. In a separate analysis, soluble
   leptin receptor (sObR) plasma levels and LEP:sObR ratio were
   significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (beta = -0-66,
   P=0.002; beta = -1.23, P=0.02) and sObR plasma levels also served as an
   independent predictor for diastolic blood pressure (beta = - 0.50;
   P=0-04). To conclude, we report common allelic variants associated with
   specific feeding behaviour and obesity-related anthropometric traits.
   Moreover, we identified allelic variants that significantly influence
   the time structure of food intake during the day.}},

Abstract = {{Response delays to predator attack may be adaptive, suggesting that
   latency to respond does not always reflect predator detection time, but
   can be a decision based on starvation-predation risk trade-offs. In
   birds, some anti-predator behaviours have been shown to be correlated
   with personality traits such as activity level and exploration. Here, we
   tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response
   latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species,
   juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Individual focal
   fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator
   while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration
   of a novel environment. We found a strong positive correlation between
   exploration and time taken to respond to the predator model. Fish that
   were fast to explore the novel environment were slower to respond to the
   predator. Our study therefore provides some of the first experimental
   evidence for a link between exploration behaviour and predator-escape

Abstract = {{Although the effects of grazing-induced savannah degradation on animal
   diversity are well documented, knowledge of how they affect space use or
   responding behaviour remains poor. In this study, we analysed space use
   of the spotted sand lizard (Pedioplanis l. lineoocellata) in degraded
   versus nondegraded habitats of southern Kalahari savannah habitats.
   Lizards were radio tracked, daily movement distances recorded and home
   range sizes calculated. In degraded Kalahari savannah habitats where
   plant diversity and perennial grass cover are low but shrub cover high,
   P. lineoocellata moves larger distances (40.88 +/- 6.42 m versus 27.43
   +/- 5.08 m) and occupies larger home ranges (646.64 +/- 244.84 m(2)
   versus 209.15 +/- 109.84 m(2)) than in nondegraded habitats (high plant
   diversity, high perennial grass cover and low shrub cover). We assume
   that this increase in daily movement distances and home range sizes is a
   behavioural plasticity to limited food resources in degraded savannah
   habitats. Although P. lineoocellata is able to adjust to resource-poor
   savannah habitats, the increase in the lizard's movement activities is
   likely to result in a higher predation risk. This is supported by the
   lower availability of protective vegetation i.e. perennial grass cover.
   Hence, we conclude that despite behavioural plasticity of P.
   lineoocellata, overgrazing has a severe negative impact on the space use
   of P. lineoocellata.}},

Abstract = {{Signals increase the fitness of a sender by altering the behaviour of

   proposes that signalling strength may be linked to supply and demand. In
   this context, a recent laboratory experiment demonstrated that cleaner

   advertisement is linked to hunger levels. We investigated signalling by
   the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes longicarpus in the field to test more
   detailed predictions of biological market theory. Shrimps often clapped
   with their pair of claws in response to approaching clients. In line
   with both theory and the previous study, the probability of clapping
   increased when the shrimps had been food deprived and clapping shrimps
   were more likely to clean than nonclapping individuals. However, we
   found no evidence for the market theory prediction that signalling was
   targeted specifically to visiting client species with the option to
   choose other cleaning stations. Instead, shrimps signalled more
   frequently towards predatory clients than towards nonpredatory clients.

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes are correlated suites of behavior, analogous to
   human personality traits. Most work to date has been taken from limited
   ``snapshots{''} in space and time, with the implicit assumption that a
   behavioral syndrome is an invariant property, fixed by evolutionary
   constraints or adaptations. However, directional selection on two
   mechanistically independent traits (selective covariance) could also
   result in correlated behaviors. Previously, we have shown that shy/bold
   behavior in Southern dumpling squid (Euprymna tasmanica) across predator
   encounter and feeding risk contexts is genetically and phenotypically
   uncoupled, and hence potentially free to vary independently. Here, we
   collected data on shy/bold behaviors from two independent wild
   populations of squid in two different years to test whether behavioral
   correlations across these same two functional contexts vary through time
   and space. We detected significant influences of population, sex, and
   body size on the expression of boldness in squid within each functional
   context, and this was coupled with significant differences in relative
   population density and adult sex ratio. Despite these changes in
   behavior and demographic parameters, we found that correlations between
   boldness scores across the two functional contexts were largely absent
   in both wild populations of squid in both years. Our work suggests that
   some animal groups may be largely characterized by context-specific
   behavioral expression. A theoretical framework which conceptualizes
   behavioral syndromes resulting from context-specific behavioral rules
   may be needed to fully understand why behaviors are sometimes
   correlated, and why sometimes they are not.}},

   Method: Three hundred thirty-four subjects (130 male), whose psychiatric
   health was verified by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I
   disorders, completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the

   (STAI), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale
   (CES-D). The schematic models for the pathway analysis from Temperament
   and Character Inventory (TCI) to TAS-20 scores were made.
   Results: Low reward dependence (RD), low self-directedness (S-D), and
   high cooperativeness (CO) had paths to TAS-20 total (P = .000, P = .000,
   and P = .042, respectively). S-D had also an indirect path via
   STAI-state to TAS total. On TAS-20 factor 1, low RD, low S-D, and high
   self-transcendence (ST) had direct effects (P = .004, P = .000, and P =
   .000, respectively). S-D had also an indirect path via STAI-state and
   (CES-D) on TAS-20 factor 1. On TAS factor 2, low novelty seeking (NS),
   high harm avoidance (HA), low RD, low S-D, and high cooperativeness (CO)
   had direct effects (P = .005, P = .011, P = .000, P = .000, and P =

   effects (P = .002 and P = .000, respectively).

Abstract = {{Populations of Western countries are severely deficient in omega-3
   intake, both in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and the Long
   Chain derivatives (LC-n-3), Eicosa-Pentaenoic-Acid and
   Docosa-Hexaenoic-Acid. Omega-3 insufficiency is a risk factor for
   cardiovascular and cerebral diseases such as coronary heart disease and
   stroke. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and induces
   a significant socioeconomic cost and a marked increase in patient/family
   burden. To date, preventive treatments and neuroprotective drugs
   identified in preclinical studies failed in clinical trials, in part
   because of an inability to tolerate drugs at neuroprotective
   concentrations. Therefore testing alternative protective strategies,
   such as functional foods/nutraceuticals, are of considerable interest.
   We have previously demonstrated that a single injection of ALA reduced
   ischemic damage by limiting glutamate-mediated neuronal death, whereas
   repeated injections displayed additive protective benefits as a result
   of increased neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurotrophin expression.
   Because intravenous injections are not a suitable long-term strategy in
   humans, the present study investigated the effect of ALA supplementation
   by an experimental diet containing rapeseed oil (RSO, a rich source of
   ALA) as the only source of lipids for stroke prevention. We tested
   several experimental diets which included 5, 10, and 20\% RSO-enriched
   diet and feeding paradigms (fresh diet was provided once or twice a week
   for 4 or 6 weeks). Our results showed that ALA supplemented diets are
   more sensitive to lipid peroxidation than a regular chow diet. Because
   the diet affected feeding behavior and animal growth, we defined
   concrete guidelines to investigate the effect of omega-3 supplementation
   on neuropathology. Among the different sets of experiments, animals fed
   with 10\% and 20\% RSO-enriched diet displayed a reduced mortality rate,
   infarct size and increased probability of spontaneous reperfusion in the
   post-ischemic period. In addition, a drastic reduction of lipid
   peroxidation levels was observed in the ischemic brain of RSO-fed
   animals. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the potential
   of employing rapeseed oil as a functional food/nutraceutical aiding in
   stroke prevention and protection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Since 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological experiment in
   semiarid thorn scrub of a national park in north-central Chile.
   Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including
   predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and
   plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach
   with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded
   vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the
   degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of
   predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed
   to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus
   with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although
   some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively
   small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate
   that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of
   principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse
   (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic
   pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger
   ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000
   verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food
   availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts
   to other important community components including birds and insects in
   order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some
   of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this
   region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of
   exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments
   selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from
   replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In
   conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that
   introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and
   that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change
   may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of
   long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now
   after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.}},

   kingdom. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
   reproductive pattern in natural populations, but growing evidence
   suggests that assortative mating most often results from sexual mating
   preferences. Recently, condition-dependent mate choice in the face of
   costly competition for mates has been proposed to explain assortative
   mating in natural populations. Variation in competitive ability may
   generate variation in both the strength and the direction of mate
   preference, resulting in assortative mating with respect to individual
   quality if low-quality competitors are less choosy, or if high-quality
   males and females pair up first, leaving low-quality individuals to form
   pairs between themselves. We investigated individuals' preferences for
   mates on the basis of differential competitive abilities and
   size-dependent costs in mate-guarding behaviour in the amphipod Gammarus
   pulex. Our results show that the presence of an unpaired male close to a
   pair can induce stress that can lead to pair separation. However, no
   direct take-over was observed. In our series of male mate choice
   experiments, under low, high or simulated levels of competition, small
   males made similar choices. Our results suggest that the frequency of
   take-overs, and more generally interference competition, can be
   considered insufficient to induce a reduced preference for large females
   in this population, and is thus unlikely to explain size-assortative
   mating. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Shelter competition is uncommon among social animals, as is the case
   among normally gregarious Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus).
   However, healthy lobsters avoid sheltering with conspecifics infected by
   a lethal pathogenic virus, PaV1. These contradictory behaviors have
   implications for shelter use and survival, especially in areas where
   shelter is limited. In laboratory experiments, we tested shelter
   competition between paired healthy and diseased juvenile lobsters in
   shelter-limited mesocosms. Neither healthy nor diseased lobsters
   dominated access to shelters, but lobsters shared shelter less often
   when diseased lobsters were present relative to controls with two
   healthy lobsters. We hypothesized that exclusion of juvenile lobsters
   from shelter results in increased mortality from predation, especially
   for the more lethargic, infected individuals. Field tethering trials
   revealed that predation was indeed higher on infected individuals and on
   all tethered lobsters deprived of shelter. We then tested in mesocosm
   experiments how the contrasting risks of predation versus infection by a
   lethal pathogen influence shelter use. Lobsters were offered a choice of
   an empty shelter or one containing a diseased lobster in the presence of
   a predator (i.e., caged octopus) whose presence normally elicits
   shelter-seeking behavior, and these data were compared with a previous
   study where the predator was absent. Lobsters selected the empty shelter
   significantly more often despite the threat of predation, foregoing the
   protection of group defense in favor of reduced infection risk. These
   results offer striking evidence of how pathogenic diseases shape not
   only the behavior of social animals but also their use of shelters and
   risk of predation.}},

Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: In human beings, as in most vertebrates, the release
   of the intestinal peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) by ingested food plays a
   major role both in digestion and the regulation of further food intake,
   but the changes in brain function and their underlying activation
   mechanisms remain unknown. Our aim was to explore, using a novel
   physiologic magnetic resonance imaging approach, the temporospatial
   brain activation matrix, in response to ingestion of a lipid meal and,
   by use of a CCK-1 receptor antagonist, to define the role of CCK in this
   activation. METHODS: We studied, in 19 healthy subjects, the brain
   activation responses to ingested lipid (dodecanoic acid) or saline
   (control) with magnetic resonance imaging. Gallbladder volume, plasma
   CCK levels, and subjective hunger and fullness scores were also
   recorded. The experiment was then repeated, with and without prior
   administration of the CCK-1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide (600 mg
   orally) with a controlled, randomized order, latin-square design.
   RESULTS: Ingested lipid activated bilaterally a matrix of brain areas,
   particularly the brain stem, pons, hypothalamus, and also cerebellum and
   motor cortical areas. These activations were abolished by
   dexloxiglumide, indicating a CCK-mediated pathway, independent of any
   nutrient-associated awareness cues. CONCLUSION: The identification of
   these activations now defines the lipid-activated brain matrix and
   provides a means by which the gut-derived homeostatic mechanisms of food
   regulation can be distinguished from secondary sensory and hedonic cues,
   thereby providing a new approach to exploring aberrant human
   gastrointestinal responses and eating behavior.}},

Title = {{Individual responses of seabirds to commercial fisheries revealed using
   GPS tracking, stable isotopes and vessel monitoring systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{487-497}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. The large amount of discards produced by commercial fisheries can
   have major impacts on marine predator populations: this abundant food
   may increase populations of some scavengers or decrease others via
   accidental bycatch. Yet, despite the conservation implications of
   discard practices, the ecology of individual scavengers is poorly
   understood.
   2. Here, we assess the influence of commercial fisheries' activity on
   the foraging behaviour of individual breeding northern gannets Morus
   bassanus. Using recent developments in stable isotope mixing models
   (Stable Isotope Analysis in R or SIAR) we estimate individual discard
   consumption. Using GPS tracking and the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS),
   we investigate behavioural responses to trawlers.
   3. Analysis of conventional diet samples, as well as stable isotope
   ratios of carbon and nitrogen in blood (plasma and cells), highlight
   marked individual differences in the proportion of fishery discards in
   the diet. Individual differences in foraging behaviour revealed by
   stable isotopes show evidence of both short-term consistency and
   behavioural flexibility.
   4. At-sea path tortuosity of 25 gannets (tracked using GPS loggers)
   revealed scale-dependent adjustments in response to VMS-derived fishing
   vessel locations, as well as to sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a
   concentration and copepod abundance. The results also indicate
   individual variability in behavioural response to trawlers.
   5. Individual differences in the amount of discards estimated from SIAR
   were negatively correlated with differences in foraging trip length and
   body condition, indicating potential fitness consequences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The management of commercial fisheries
   and apex predators is a daunting task. Ultimately, reducing bycatch and
   removing dependency on discards remain key conservation priorities, but
   managers should also ensure that scavenging species have sufficient
   alternative food to meet their energetic needs, to ameliorate potential
   unforeseen knock-on consequences. The results of Stable Isotope Analysis
   (SIAR) reveal intra-population differences in discard consumption by
   gannets; differences that have impacts on foraging effort and body
   condition. The use of GPS tracking and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS)
   reveal that gannet at-sea behaviour is influenced by fishing vessels,
   although this also varies among individuals. A combination of SIAR, GPS
   tracking and VMS can be used to study fishery/scavenger interactions in
   detail at the individual level, to answer fundamental questions about
   scavenging behaviour.}},

Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{For nearly all life forms, perceptual systems provide access to a host
   of environmental cues, including the availability of food and mates as
   well as the presence of disease and predators. Presumably, individuals
   use this information to assess the current and future states of the
   environment and to enact appropriate developmental, behavioral, and
   regulatory decisions. Recent work using the nematode worm,
   Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has
   established that aging is subject to modulation through neurosensory
   systems and that this regulation is evolutionarily conserved. To date,
   sensory manipulations shown to impact Drosophila aging have involved
   general loss of function or manipulation of complex stimuli. We
   therefore know little about the specific inputs, sensors, or associated
   neural circuits that affect these life and death decisions. We find that
   a specialized population of olfactory neurons that express receptor
   Gr63a (a component of the olfactory receptor for gaseous phase CO(2))
   affects fly lifespan and physiology. Gr63a loss of function leads to
   extended lifespan, increased fat deposition, and enhanced resistance to
   some ( but not all) environmental stresses. Furthermore, we find that
   the reduced lifespan that accompanies exposure to odors from live yeast
   is dependent on Gr63a. Together these data implicate a specific sensory
   cue (CO(2)) and its associated receptor as having the ability to
   modulate fly lifespan and alter organism stress response and physiology.
   Because Gr63a is expressed in a well-defined population of neurons,
   future work may now be directed at dissecting more complex neurosensory
   and neuroendocrine circuits that modulate aging in Drosophila.}},

Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The neurobiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains
   unclear. Dysfunctions of several neurobiological systems, including
   serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and other neurotransmitter systems, have
   been discussed. Here we present a theory that alterations in the
   sensitivity of opioid receptors or the availability of endogenous
   opioids constitute part of the underlying pathophysiology of BPD. The
   alarming symptoms and self-destructive behaviors of the affected
   patients may be explained by uncontrollable and unconscious attempts to
   stimulate their endogenous opioid system (EOS) and the dopaminergic
   reward system, regardless of the possible harmful consequences.
   Neurobiological findings that support this hypothesis are reviewed:
   Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent and risky sexual
   contacts, and attention-seeking behavior may be explained by attempts to
   make use of the rewarding effects of human attachment mediated by the
   EOS. Anhedonia and feelings of emptiness may be an expression of reduced
   activity of the EOS. Patients with BPD tend to abuse substances that
   target p.-opioid receptors. Self-injury, food restriction, aggressive
   behavior, and sensation seeking may be interpreted as desperate attempts
   to artificially set the body to survival mode in order to mobilize the
   last reserves of the EOS. BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance
   abuse, anorexia, self-injury, depersonalization, and sexual
   overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor
   antagonists. An understanding of the neurobiology of BPD may help in
   developing new treatments for patients with this severe disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Current knowledge suggests that patterns of energy storage and depletion
   in animals are governed by behavioural trade-offs between risks
   associated with feeding and future energy demands. However, the length
   of adverse periods varies over geographical or climatic gradients. To
   explore the potential for genotypic sources of variation in behavioural
   trade-offs, we compared the winter energy-depletion patterns among 13
   wild populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) along a
   latitudinal gradient (58-70 degrees N) and performed common-environment
   experiments of energy-state-dependent feeding. In the wild, winter
   lipid-depletion rates were lower for northern than for southern
   populations. The variation in spring lipid levels among the population
   was lower than autumn variation, with storage lipid levels clustered
   close to critical limits for survival. In semi-natural stream channels
   with natural food supply, hatchery-reared fish originating from northern
   populations showed a positive scaling of feeding activity with
   decreasing energy levels, whereas southern populations did not. In
   conclusion, juvenile Atlantic salmon from northern populations defend
   their energy levels more strongly than fish from southern populations.
   Adaptive variation in feeding activity appears important for this
   difference. Thus, the present study shows a link between geographical
   patterns in storage energy trajectories and adaptive differences in
   state-dependent feeding motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Feather pecking (FP) is a major welfare problem in laying hens,

   behaviour, however fearful birds are also known to be more sensitive to
   develop FP. The relationship between fear-responses, foraging and FP is
   not well understood, therefore we studied the behaviour of 16 birds from
   a high feather pecking (HFP) line and 16 birds from a low feather
   pecking (LFP) line at 35 weeks of age inside a plus-maze. Birds were
   from the 10th generation of selection for either high or low FP. First
   exposure to the maze was used to measure birds' fear-responses to a
   novel barren environment. Hereafter, birds were trained three times in
   the maze with four different food-items that were offered in one of the
   four arms (i.e. regular food-pellets, feathers, grass, and mealworms
   hidden in wood-shavings). On the fifth day, birds were tested in the
   maze for 10 min during which they could choose to eat from all available
   food-items. When exposed for the first time in the maze HFP birds walked
   a longer distance, vocalized sooner and had more exploratory pecks
   compared to LFP birds who showed more wing-movements and defecations.
   When given a choice of food inside the maze both lines preferred eating
   worms, but HFP birds had more worm-eating bouts and ate faster than LFP
   birds. The results of this study indicate that HFP birds respond
   actively to fear-eliciting situations, which may originate from a
   proactive coping style. Instead of a clear preference for eating
   feathers, this study supports earlier findings that HFP birds have a
   stronger pecking motivation than LFP birds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Environmental effects on sets of traits of organisms can have important
   consequences on populations. In marine species with complex life cycles,
   plastic responses in larval traits can affect size at metamorphosis and
   juvenile growth. These traits can ultimately affect survival and
   recruitment. Here, I evaluate. links between pelagic conditions, natural
   variations in larval physiological traits (duration of development, size
   of the megalopa stage), size at metamorphosis, and juvenile growth in
   the shore crab Carcinus mamas. I sampled settling larvae. (megalopae) of
   C. maenas, daily, during the settlement season of three consecutive
   years, in the island of Helgoland (North Sea, German Bight). Megalopae
   were brought to the laboratory where postmetamorphic growth was
   evaluated under different larval food environments. Traits varied
   considerably at several temporal scales; variation was not consistent
   among years. However, the size at metamorphosis was always larger at the
   start of the settlement season. Some variability correlated with
   predicted changes in transport processes and dynamics of plume fronts
   around the study area. Positive relationships between predicted periods
   of formation of plume fronts, settlement rates, and size at
   metamorphosis suggest a link between oceanographic conditions and
   individual traits. Size at metamorphosis explained juvenile growth
   rates: during the first five juvenile stages, larger individuals grew
   faster and reached larger size at stage (that is, at any stage
   observed). Megalopae experiencing ad libitum food conditions grew faster
   as juveniles than those deprived of food, showing that size at
   metamorphosis and juvenile growth respond plastically to variations in
   the larval food environment. I conclude that juvenile growth rate in C.
   maenas can be affected by natural environmental conditions experienced
   by larval stages; this effect is mediated by changes in the. size at
   metamorphosis. Most likely the most important factor operating on the
   size at metamorphosis was food (availability/quality). Since juveniles
   of this species attain a refuge in size from cannibals, changes in size
   at metamorphosis could codetermine the chances of postsettlement
   survival. Further consideration of physiological traits and their
   consequences at the level of populations should lead to a better

   addition, there was a significant positive relationship between
   individual performance in these two contexts, with fish that explored
   more quickly in the novel environment tending to be among the first to
   gain access to restricted food. In two follow-up studies, resting

Abstract = {{Females often show a preference for exaggerated male sexual traits or
   courtship behaviors. Such preferences can benefit females if trait
   expression is correlated with male genetic quality or phenotypic
   condition. Previous studies of several Photinus fireflies have revealed
   considerable intraspecific variation in the bioluminescent courtship
   signals emitted by males, and have also demonstrated that females prefer
   more conspicuous male signals. Thus, females might gain information
   about male phenotypic quality if courtship signals reflect male
   condition. We examined possible condition-dependence of Photinus male
   courtship signals using two complementary approaches. First we
   experimentally manipulated male mating status, which is expected to
   affect male condition by depleting resources required for nuptial gift
   formation, and looked at how individual male flash signals changed with
   mating status and over time. We used an additional approach to assess
   condition-dependence by examining whether a relationship exists between
   flash signal parameters and measures of male condition and body shape.
   We found that the pulse rate of P. greeni courtship signals was not
   altered by male mating status or age, and that the pulse duration of P.
   ignitus signals was also not affected by male mating status. In P.
   pyralis fireflies, males showed a non-significant trend toward reduced
   signal pulse duration with age. When we examined the relationship
   between male flash signals and condition measures, we found no effect of
   male condition or body shape on courtship signals in P. greeni or P.
   ignitus; in P. pyralis, males with wider body shapes produced longer
   duration flash signals. On the other hand, we found no evidence in P.
   pyralis that condition predicted flash duration. Taken together, these
   results indicate that Photinus males' flash signals do not reflect adult
   male condition, and suggest that females are unlikely to use courtship
   signals as an indicator of male phenotypic quality.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a major selective force for many species, and the

   shaped by its body condition. In a laboratory experiment, we investigate
   the influence of reproductive status on the locomotor performance and
   anti-predator behaviour of female funnel-web spiders Agelenopsis
   emertoni, both on and off their webs. In general, mated females were
   slower than unmated females, and a significant amount of variation in
   the locomotor performance of mated females was explained by their
   relative reproductive investment (egg case mass/female mass before
   mating). Regardless of whether they were on or off their webs, mated
   females were less likely to exhibit flight responses to simulated
   predator threats than were unmated females. When off their webs, mated
   females exhibited more aggressive anti-predator responses (i.e. display
   behaviour), but while on their webs they were more likely to exhibit
   crypsis or huddling anti-predator responses. Thus, shifts in
   anti-predator strategy might allow mated females to compensate
   behaviourally for their reduced locomotor performance.}},

Title = {{Manipulation of Behavioral Decline in Caenorhabditis elegans with the
   Rag GTPase raga-1}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Normal aging leads to an inexorable decline in motor performance,
   contributing to medical morbidity and decreased quality of life. While
   much has been discovered about genetic determinants of lifespan, less is
   known about modifiers of age-related behavioral decline and whether new
   gene targets may be found which extend vigorous activity, with or
   without extending lifespan. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we have
   developed a model of declining neuromuscular function and conducted a
   screen for increased behavioral activity in aged animals. In this model,
   behavioral function suffers from profound reductions in locomotory
   frequency, but coordination is strikingly preserved until very old age.
   By screening for enhancers of locomotion at advanced ages we identified
   the ras-related Rag GTPase raga-1 as a novel modifier of behavioral
   aging. raga-1 loss of function mutants showed vigorous swimming late in
   life. Genetic manipulations revealed that a gain of function raga-1
   curtailed behavioral vitality and shortened lifespan, while a dominant
   negative raga-1 lengthened lifespan. Dietary restriction results
   indicated that a raga-1 mutant is relatively protected from the
   life-shortening effects of highly concentrated food, while RNAi
   experiments suggested that raga-1 acts in the highly conserved target of
   rapamycin (TOR) pathway in C. elegans. Rag GTPases were recently shown
   to mediate nutrient-dependent activation of TOR. This is the first
   demonstration of their dramatic effects on behavior and aging. This work
   indicates that novel modulators of behavioral function can be identified
   in screens, with implications for future study of the clinical
   amelioration of age-related decline.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Developmental Delay in Chagas Disease Vectors: An Evolutionary
   Ecology Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: The developmental time of vector insects is important in
   population dynamics, evolutionary biology, epidemiology and in their
   responses to global climatic change. In the triatomines (Triatominae,
   Reduviidae), vectors of Chagas disease, evolutionary ecology concepts,
   which may allow for a better understanding of their biology, have not
   been applied. Despite delay in the molting in some individuals observed
   in triatomines, no effort was made to explain this variability.
   Methodology: We applied four methods: (1) an e-mail survey sent to 30
   researchers with experience in triatomines, (2) a statistical
   description of the developmental time of eleven triatomine species, (3)
   a relationship between development time pattern and climatic
   inter-annual variability, (4) a mathematical optimization model of
   evolution of developmental delay (diapause).
   Principal Findings: 85.6\% of responses informed on prolonged
   developmental times in 5(th) instar nymphs, with 20 species identified
   with remarkable developmental delays. The developmental time analysis
   showed some degree of bi-modal pattern of the development time of the
   5(th) instars in nine out of eleven species but no trend between
   development time pattern and climatic inter-annual variability was
   observed. Our optimization model predicts that the developmental delays
   could be due to an adaptive risk-spreading diapause strategy, only if
   survival throughout the diapause period and the probability of random
   occurrence of ``bad'' environmental conditions are sufficiently high.
   Conclusions/Significance: Developmental delay may not be a simple
   non-adaptive phenotypic plasticity in development time, and could be a
   form of adaptive diapause associated to a physiological mechanism
   related to the postponement of the initiation of reproduction, as an
   adaptation to environmental stochasticity through a spreading of risk
   (bet-hedging) strategy. We identify a series of parameters that can be
   measured in the field and laboratory to test this hypothesis. The
   importance of these findings is discussed in terms of global climatic
   change and epidemiological consequences.}},

Title = {{Systems genetics analysis of body weight and energy metabolism traits in
   Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Obesity and phenotypic traits associated with this condition
   exhibit significant heritability in natural populations of most
   organisms. While a number of genes and genetic pathways have been
   implicated to play a role in obesity associated traits, the genetic
   architecture that underlies the natural variation in these traits is
   largely unknown. Here, we used 40 wild-derived inbred lines of
   Drosophila melanogaster to quantify genetic variation in body weight,
   the content of three major metabolites (glycogen, triacylglycerol, and
   glycerol) associated with obesity, and metabolic rate in young flies. We
   chose these lines because they were previously screened for variation in
   whole-genome transcript abundance and in several adult life-history
   traits, including longevity, resistance to starvation stress, chill-coma
   recovery, mating behavior, and competitive fitness. This enabled us not
   only to identify candidate genes and transcriptional networks that might
   explain variation for energy metabolism traits, but also to investigate
   the genetic interrelationships among energy metabolism, behavioral, and
   life-history traits that have evolved in natural populations.
   Results: We found significant genetically based variation in all traits.
   Using a genome-wide association screen for single feature polymorphisms
   and quantitative trait transcripts, we identified 337, 211, 237, 553,
   and 152 novel candidate genes associated with body weight, glycogen
   content, triacylglycerol storage, glycerol levels, and metabolic rate,
   respectively. Weighted gene co-expression analyses grouped transcripts
   associated with each trait in significant modules of co-expressed genes
   and we interpreted these modules in terms of their gene enrichment based
   on Gene Ontology analysis. Comparison of gene co-expression modules for
   traits in this study with previously determined modules for life-history
   traits identified significant modular pleiotropy between glycogen
   content, body weight, competitive fitness, and starvation resistance.
   Conclusions: Combining a large phenotypic dataset with information on
   variation in genome wide transcriptional profiles has provided insight
   into the complex genetic architecture underlying natural variation in
   traits that have been associated with obesity. Our findings suggest that
   understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in metabolic traits
   in natural populations may require that we understand more fully the
   degree to which these traits are genetically correlated with other
   traits, especially those directly affecting fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Parental behavior contributes to the success of a diverse array of taxa,
   and female-only nest attendance is particularly widespread. Python
   egg-brooding behavior is an intriguing example of female-only nest
   attendance because it significantly influences several critical
   developmental variables, namely embryonic predation, hydration,
   respiration and temperature. During brooding, females predominately
   adopt a tightly coiled posture that reduces the exchange of heat, water
   vapor, O(2) and CO(2) between the nest and clutch environment, which
   benefits egg water balance at the cost of respiration. To determine the
   plasticity of this important behavior, we manipulated nest temperature
   and humidity while monitoring nest-clutch thermal, hydric and
   respiratory relationships to test the hypothesis that female Children's
   pythons (Antaresia childreni) modify their egg-brooding behavior due to
   an interaction between environmental thermal and hydric conditions.
   During moderate and high nest humidity treatments (23 and 32gm(-3)
   H(2)O, respectively), females spent more time coiling tightly when the
   nest was cooling than when it was warming, which benefited clutch
   temperature. However, brooding females in low-humidity nest environments
   (13 g m(-3) H(2)O) showed a high frequency of tight coiling even when
   the nest was warming; thus, nest temperature and humidity had an
   interactive effect on egg-brooding behavior in support of our
   hypothesis. Our results also suggest that certain egg-brooding behaviors
   (i.e. postural adjustments) are more energetically costly to females
   than other behaviors (i. e. tight coiling). In sum, we provide empirical
   support for the adaptive plasticity of python egg-brooding behavior,
   which offers insight into the general significance of female-only nest
   attendance in animals.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Because parental recognition of overweight in young children
   is poor, we need to determine how best to inform parents that their
   child is overweight in a way that enhances their acceptance and supports
   motivation for positive change. This study will assess 1) whether weight

   acceptance of their child's weight status and enhances motivation for
   behaviour change, and 2) whether a family-based individualised lifestyle
   intervention, delivered primarily by a MInT mentor with limited support
   from ``expert{''} consultants in psychology, nutrition and physical
   activity, can improve weight outcomes after 12 and 24 months in young
   overweight children, compared with usual care.
   Methods/Design: 1500 children aged 4-8 years will be screened for
   overweight (height, weight, waist, blood pressure, body composition).
   Parents will complete questionnaires on feeding practices, physical
   activity, diet, parenting, motivation for healthy lifestyles, and
   demographics. Parents of children classified as overweight (BMI >= CDC
   85(th)) will receive feedback about the results using Motivational
   interviewing or Usual care. Parental responses to feedback will be
   assessed two weeks later and participants will be invited into the
   intervention. Additional baseline measurements (accelerometry, diet,
   quality of life, child behaviour) will be collected and families will be
   randomised to Tailored package or Usual care. Parents in the Usual care
   condition will meet once with an advisor who will offer general advice
   regarding healthy eating and activity. Parents in the Tailored package
   condition will attend a single session with an ``expert team{''} (MInT
   mentor, dietitian, physical activity advisor, clinical psychologist) to
   identify current challenges for the family, develop tailored goals for
   change, and plan behavioural strategies that best suit each family. The
   mentor will continue to provide support to the family via telephone and
   in-person consultations, decreasing in frequency over the two-year
   intervention. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline, 12 and 24
   months.

Abstract = {{Specialized predators must obtain all required nutrients from a single
   prey species. In some species nutrient balance may be possible by
   selecting various body parts. We tested how different ant body parts
   affect the fitness of a specialized ant predator and whether the
   predator possesses adaptations in its feeding behaviour that allow
   nutrient balancing while feeding on only a single prey species. We used
   a formicine-specialist spider, Zodarion rubidum, reared on three diet
   types: an entire ant, two ant gasters and two ant foreparts ( heads,
   thoraces and legs) of Lasius ants. Spiders grew faster, survived longer
   and developed earlier on the diet consisting of two ant foreparts.
   Spiders fed on the two ant gasters had the slowest growth, highest
   mortality and slowest development while spiders fed entire ants showed
   intermediate performance. In preference experiments, we studied the
   spiders' consumption of three Formicinae ant species that differ
   markedly in size. With small Lasius ants, spiders equally exploited the
   gaster and the foreparts, but with larger Formica and Camponotus ants,
   spiders fed significantly more on the foreparts than on the gaster.
   Spiders almost always fed on the gaster, suggesting that it might
   include beneficial nutrients. Nutritional analysis of the ant bodies of
   the three species revealed that there were more lipids in the gaster,
   while the foreparts contained more proteins. Our results suggest that
   ant-eating spiders might balance their nutritional needs by selectively
   consuming various body parts of their exclusive prey. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Climate change and habitat destruction are widely recognized as major
   threats to species' survival. As a result of these anthropogenic
   impacts, species are often forced into novel landscapes where their
   persistence is difficult to predict. Knowledge of how individuals move
   or disperse through the landscape, choose habitat in which to settle,
   and produce offspring which survive to repeat the process can greatly
   improve our ability to predict species' persistence. The field of
   behavioral landscape ecology uses a strong theoretical base to explore,
   often experimentally, how the behavior of a particular species is
   affected by heterogeneous and rapidly changing landscapes and can offer
   valuable insight for managing species in the face of human-induced
   environmental changes. When interpreted by modelers, results of
   landscape-level behavioral experiments can be quantified for use in
   predictive models. To this end, we summarize the methods and results of
   research using direct experimental manipulation techniques broken into
   the following categories: translocations, playback experiments, food
   resource manipulations, manipulations of reproductive success, direct
   manipulations of the landscape, and manipulations of predation risk. We
   review and place in a theoretical framework the results from this
   emerging body of research regarding how organisms move in and respond to
   different types of landscapes, both natural and human-altered. We go
   onto highlight the potential of each experimental method to quantify
   different processes, which may be useful when interpreted by modelers
   attempting to parameterize predictive models. Finally, we suggest future
   directions for experimental research that will allow for greater
   integration of behavioral landscape ecology and predictive modeling. (C)

Abstract = {{Background \& aims: To consider the hypothesis that addiction to food,
   or more specifically sucrose, plays a role in obesity and eating
   disorders.
   Methods: By considering the relevant literature a series of predictions
   were examined, derived from the hypothesis that addiction to sucrose
   consumption can develop. Fasting should increase food cravings,
   predominantly for sweet items; cravings should occur after an overnight
   fast; the obese should find sweetness particularly attractive; a
   high-sugar consumption should predispose to obesity. More specifically
   predictions based on the hypothesis that addiction to sugar is central
   to bingeing disorders were developed. Dieting should predate the
   development of bingeing; dietary style rather than psychological, social
   and economic factors should be predispose to eating disorders; sweet
   items should be preferentially consumed while bingeing; opioid
   antagonists should cause withdrawal symptoms; bingeing should develop at
   a younger age when there is a greater preference for sweetness.
   Results: The above predications have in common that on no occasion was
   the behaviour predicted by an animal model of sucrose addiction

Abstract = {{Background The prevalence of chronic sleep deprivation is increasing in
   modern societies with negative health consequences. Recently, an
   association between short sleep and obesity has been reported.
   Purpose Primary objectives: To assess the feasibility of increasing
   sleep duration to a healthy length (approximately 7A1/2 h) and to
   determine the effect of sleep extension on body weight. Secondary
   objectives: To examine the long-term effects of sleep extension on
   endocrine (leptin and ghrelin) and immune (cytokines) parameters, the
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome, body composition, psychomotor
   vigilance, mood, and quality of life.
   Methods One hundred-fifty obese participants who usually sleep less than
   6A1/2 h, are being randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either an Intervention
   or to a Comparison Group. They are stratified by age (above and below
   35) and the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. During the first
   12 months (Efficacy Phase) of the study, participants are evaluated at
   bi-monthly intervals: the Intervention Group is coached to increase
   sleep by at least 30-60 min/night, while the Comparison Group maintains
   baseline sleep duration. In the second (Effectiveness) phase,
   participants converge into the same group and are asked to increase
   (Comparison Group) or maintain (Intervention Group) sleep duration and
   are evaluated at 6-month intervals for an additional 3 years.
   Non-pharmacological and behavior-based interventions are being utilized
   to increase sleep duration. Endocrine, metabolic, and psychological
   effects are monitored. The sleep, energy expenditure, and caloric intake
   are assessed by activity monitors and food recall questionnaires. At
   yearly intervals, body composition, abdominal fat, and basal metabolic
   rate are measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA),
   computerized tomography (CT), and indirect calorimetry, respectively.
   Results As of January 2010, 109 participants had been randomized, 64 to
   the Intervention Group and 45 to the Comparison Group (76\% women, 62\%
   minorities, average age: 40.8 years; BMI: 38.5 kg/m(2)). Average sleep
   duration at screening was less than 6 h/night, 40.3 h/week. A total of
   28 Intervention and 22 Comparison participants had completed the
   Efficacy Phase.
   Limitations The study is not blinded and the sample size is relatively
   small.

   CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, and IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels. The ewes were milked
   for 3 d after the isolation test to determine cortisol levels and IL-1
   beta and IL-6 concentrations in whey. Milk yield was recorded at each
   milking, and milk samples were analyzed for pH, nutritional parameters,
   renneting properties, and somatic cell count. During the isolation test,
   HC ewes exhibited a shorter duration of movement and fewer bleats than
   LC ewes. The average plasma IL-1 beta concentration was higher in HC
   than in LC ewes. The average whey IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations were
   higher in whey from HC ewes than in LC ewes. A positive correlation
   emerged between plasma and whey IL-1 beta concentrations. The average
   CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in blood was lower in HC than in LC ewes. Time from
   isolation affected the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio: at 120 min, the
   CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio increased compared with that at 10 min after
   isolation and then decreased until 300 min after isolation. On average,
   ewes with low cortisol concentrations showed higher milk production and
   lower SCC than ewes with high cortisol concentrations. Results suggest
   that plasma cortisol concentration is connected to the behavioral
   response and immune competence of dairy ewes and cytokine
   concentrations. Both whey IL-1 beta and IL-6 can be considered reliable
   indicators of the magnitude of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
   activation. The stress-induced changes in CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio are
   critical for controlling disease incidence and planning appropriate
   vaccination programs. High reactivity of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also associated with a reduction
   in milk production and an increased predisposition to develop
   intramammary inflammatory processes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term
   effects of participation in a cardiovascular screening program and of
   dietary counseling on self-reported psychosocial outcomes and health
   concerns. Methods: High-risk subjects (n=563) with hyperlipidemia from
   the Oslo Diet and Antismoking Study (1972-1977) were reexamined after 25
   years and randomly assigned to a new 3-year prospective 2x2 factorial
   placebo-controlled study in 1997 of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
   and/or dietary counseling. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
   Life Satisfaction Index (LSI), and a new questionnaire on health
   concerns and behavior in response to risk information were collected at
   the 25-year follow-up. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and LSI
   were evaluated at the end of the 3-year Diet and Omega-3 Intervention
   Trial on atherosclerosis (DOIT) in 505 subjects. Results: Twenty-five
   years after the screening program, HADS-anxiety was similar to the
   Norwegian norms (3.3 vs. 3.5), while HADS-depression was significantly
   lower (3.6 vs. 4.1, P<.01). Patients reported that 25 years of awareness
   of hyperlipidemia had influenced health concerns through a moderate
   change in diet habits, some restriction in life conduct, but an
   improvement of the total life situation. After a novel 3-year
   intervention in DOIT, there was no difference between the dietary
   counseling and control group with regard to anxiety, depression, or life
   satisfaction, but HADS-anxiety increased significantly (4.0 vs. 3.3,
   P<.001) in both groups. Conclusion: Compared to the general population,
   screening-positive subjects did not have increased mental distress 25
   years after screening, and beneficial health behavior persisted. Dietary
   counseling did not affect psychosocial outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We explored the response to habitat desiccation in tadpoles of the warty
   toad Rhinella spinulosa in a manipulative field experiment. We built an
   artificial pond system with two desiccation levels (high and low) and
   populated with tadpoles at Gosner stage 25. Each treatment was
   replicated six times. We measured the survival, size and age at
   metamorphosis, development rate and hind limb length in metamorphs. The
   results showed that tadpoles from the high desiccation ponds accelerated
   their development, reaching metamorphosis at an earlier age than
   tadpoles from the low desiccation ponds. Survival, size at metamorphosis
   and hind limb length were not different between treatments. This
   experiment demonstrated that tadpoles of R. spinulosa accelerate their
   development in response to habitat desiccation. Such plasticity may
   allow them to avoid mortality in short duration ponds. No evidence for a
   trade-off between development time and size at metamorphosis was found
   in this experiment. We suggest that factors such as initial tadpole
   density and nutritional quality of food would contribute towards
   determining whether metamorphosis occurs at the developmental threshold

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity can be integral in adapting organisms to the
   environment experienced during growth. Adaptive plastic responses may be
   especially important in prioritizing development in response to stress
   during ontogeny. To evaluate this, I examined how developmental
   conditions for mourning doves related to early growth and how this
   affected fledging age, an important life-history transition for birds.
   The life history of mourning doves is consistent with strong selective
   pressure to minimize fledging age. Therefore, I predicted that in the
   face of nutritional stress associated with experimental brood-size
   increases, young would prioritize growth to structures that promote
   early fledging to reduce the effect of slowed overall growth on fledging
   age. Increasing brood size slowed overall structural growth of nestlings
   and affected the relative allocation of growth among different body
   parts. Total wing area was the best predictor of fledging age and
   individuals from larger broods had larger wings relative to overall body
   size. Although nestlings from larger broods fledged at later ages owing
   to slower overall growth, prioritization of wing growth reduced this
   effect by an estimated 1.6 days relative to the delay if plasticity
   among body parts had not occurred. This was an 11 per cent reduction in
   the predicted developmental time it took to reach this important
   life-history transition. Results demonstrate that preferential
   allocation to wing growth can affect the timing of this life-history
   transition and that morphological plasticity during development can have
   adaptive near-term effects during avian development.}},

Title = {{Evolution of embryonic developmental period in the marine bird families
   Alcidae and Spheniscidae: roles for nutrition and predation?}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nutrition and predation have been considered two primary
   agents of selection important in the evolution of avian life history
   traits. The relative importance of these natural selective forces in the
   evolution of avian embryonic developmental period (EDP) remain poorly
   resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus on a
   single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes. The
   marine bird families Alcidae (auks) and Spheniscidae (penguins) exhibit
   marked variation in EDP, as well as behavioural and ecological traits
   ultimately linked to EDP. Therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique
   opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a key
   life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level. We used phylogenetic
   comparative methods to investigate the relative importance of
   behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in
   the evolution of avian EDP.
   Results: Three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition
   and predation risk (i.e., clutch size, activity pattern, and nesting
   habits) were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and
   penguin EDP based on models predicting EDP from egg mass. Species with
   larger clutch sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and open nests had
   significantly shorter EDPs. Further, EDP was found to be longer among
   birds which forage in distant offshore waters, relative to those that
   foraged in near shore waters, in line with our predictions, but not
   significantly so.
   Conclusion: Current debate has emphasized predation as the primary agent
   of selection driving avian life history diversification. Our results
   suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective
   forces in the evolution of auk and penguin EDP, and highlight the
   importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic scales. We
   suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups
   will continue to constructively inform the debate on evolutionary
   determinants of avian EDP, as well as other life history parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse prenatal environment, such as intrauterine growth retardation
   (IUGR), increases the risk for negative neurobehavioral outcomes. IUGR,
   affecting approximately 10\% of all US infants, is a known risk factor
   for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia
   spectrum disorders and addiction. Mouse dams were fed a protein
   deficient (8.5\% protein) or isocaloric control (18\% protein) diet
   through pregnancy and lactation (a well validated rodent model of IUGR).
   Dopamine-related gene expression, dopamine content and behavior were
   examined in adult offspring. IUGR offspring have six to eightfold
   over-expression of dopamine (DA)-related genes (tyrosine hydroxylase
   (TH) and dopamine transporter) in brain regions related to reward
   processing (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, prefrontal
   cortex (PFC)) and homeostatic control (hypothalamus), as well as
   increased number of TH-ir neurons in the VTA and increased dopamine in
   the PFC. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (Cdkn1c) is critical for
   dopaminergic neuron development. Methylation of the promoter region of
   Cdkn1c was decreased by half and there was a resultant two to sevenfold
   increase in Cdkn1c mRNA expression across brain regions. IUGR animals
   demonstrated alterations in dopamine-dependent behaviors, including
   altered reward-processing, hyperactivity and exaggerated locomotor
   response to cocaine. These data describe significant dopamine-related
   molecular and behavioral abnormalities in a mouse model of IUGR. This
   animal model, with both face validity (behavior) and construct validity
   (link to IUGR and dopamine dysfunction) may prove useful in identifying

   days prior to the first testing session, HAB mice were placed in the

   tube and animals were allowed to make 25 successful retrievals of food
   pellets. The testing procedure was repeated 4 days later. CT mice were
   not submitted to the habituation sessions. A significant side-dependent
   difference in consistency of laterality was observed between groups in
   the first session: all (100\%) right-pawed CT mice used their right paw
   to make their first successful retrieval of food in the first testing
   session, while only 61\% of left-pawed mice used their left paw. The
   same pattern was observed when the first five retrievals were
   considered: 100\% right-pawed CT mice and 72\% left-pawed CT mice were
   consistent. No differences were observed in the HAB group: in both
   side-preference subgroups, 88\% of the animals showed consistent
   laterality. These results indicate that behavioural lateralization in

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is perhaps the most lethal mental disorder, in
   part due to starvation-related health problems, but especially because
   of high suicide rates. One potential reason for high suicide rates in AN
   may be that those affected face pain and provocation on many fronts,
   which may in turn reduce their fear of pain and thereby increase risk
   for death by suicide. The purpose of the following studies was to
   explore whether repetitive exposure to painful and destructive behaviors
   such as vomiting, laxative use, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) was
   a mechanism that linked AN-binge-purging (ANBP) subtype, as opposed to
   AN-restricting subtype (ANR), to extreme suicidal behavior. Study 1
   utilized a sample of 787 individuals diagnosed with one or the other
   subtype of AN, and structural equation modeling results supported
   provocative behaviors as a mechanism linking ANBP to suicidal behavior.
   A second, unexpected mechanism emerged linking ANR to suicidal behavior
   via restricting. Study 2, which used a sample of 249 AN patients,
   replicated these findings, including the second mechanism linking ANR to
   suicide attempts. Two potential routes to suicidal behavior in AN appear
   to have been identified: one route through repetitive experience with
   provocative behaviors for ANBP, and a second for exposure to pain
   through the starvation of restricting in ANR. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Most current wildlife habitat models, such as resource selection
   functions, typically assume a static environment, extrapolate poorly in
   space and time, and often lack linkages to population processes. We
   submit that more mechanistic habitat models that directly consider
   bottom-up resources affecting growth and reproduction (i.e., food) and
   top-down limitations affecting survival are needed to effectively
   predict habitat quality, especially in the presence of rapid
   environmental change. Here we present a general model for estimating
   potential habitat quality (relating to growth and reproduction) and
   realised habitat quality (accounting for survival) using basic knowledge
   of the species' seasonal diet, predicted locations of food resource
   patches and regional patterns in mortality risk. We illustrate our model
   for a threatened population of grizzly bears in west-central Alberta.
   Bi-monthly potential habitat quality successfully predicted habitat
   selection by radio-collared grizzly bears, while multi-seasonal realised
   habitat quality predicted patterns in occupancy-abundance as measured
   from unique bears at hair-snag sites. Bottom-up resources therefore
   predicted patterns of habitat selection, while top-down processes
   (survival) were necessary to scale-up to population measures. We suggest
   that more direct measures of resources and environments that affect
   growth, reproduction and survival, as well as match the temporal scale
   of animal behaviour, be considered when developing wildlife habitat

   pre- and postnatal development can induce lasting effects on health and
   disease risk in later life up to old age, including later obesity risk,

   Three meta-analyses of observational studies found that obesity risk at
   school age was reduced with early breastfeeding compared to formula
   feeding. We assumed that breastfeeding protects against later obesity by
   reducing the occurrence of high weight gain in infancy and that one
   causative factor is the lower protein content of human milk compared to
   usual infant formulas (the ``early protein hypothesis{''}). We are
   testing this hypothesis in the European Childhood Obesity Project, a
   double-blind, randomized clinical trial enrolling 1,678 infants in five
   countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain). We have randomized
   healthy infants born at term to receive for the first year infant
   formula and follow-on formula with higher or lower protein contents,
   respectively. The follow-up data obtained at age 2 years indicates that
   feeding formula with reduced protein content normalizes early growth
   relative to a breastfed reference group and the current WHO growth
   standard, which may furnish a significant long-term protection against
   later obesity. We conclude that infant feeding practice has a high
   potential for long-term health effects. The results obtained should
   stimulate the review of recommendations and policies for infant formula
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Plants infested with herbivores release specific volatile compounds that
   are known to recruit natural enemies. The response of natural enemies to
   these volatiles may be either learned or genetically determined. We
   asked whether there is genetic variation in the response of the
   predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis to methyl salicylate (MeSa). MeSa
   is a volatile compound consistently produced by plants being attacked by
   the two-spotted spider mite, the prey of P. persimilis. We predicted
   that predators express genetically determined responses during
   long-distance migration where previously learned associations may have
   less value. Additionally, we asked whether these responses depend on
   odors from uninfested plants as a background to MeSa. To infer a genetic
   basis, we analyzed the variation in response to MeSa among iso-female
   lines of P. persimilis by using choice-tests that involved either (1)
   MeSa presented as a single compound or (2) MeSa with background-odor
   from uninfested lima bean plants. These tests were conducted for starved
   and satiated predators, i.e., two physiological states, one that
   approximates migration and another that mimics local patch exploration.
   We found variation among iso-female lines in the responses to MeSa, thus
   showing genetic variation for this behavior. The variation was more
   pronounced in the starved predators, thus indicating that P. persimilis
   relies on innate preferences when migrating. Background volatiles of
   uninfested plants changed the predators' responses to MeSa in a manner
   that depended on physiological state and iso-female line. Thus, it is
   possible to select for context-dependent behavioral responses of natural
   enemies to plant volatiles.}},

   and catechol-O-methyltransferase were significantly reduced in OBs of
   mice on the ADF diet. Both acute and chronic administration of cocaine
   suppressed the production of new OB cells, and this effect of cocaine
   was attenuated in mice on the ADF diet. Cocaine administration to mice
   on the control diet resulted in up-regulation of OB genes involved in
   mitochondrial energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, cellular stress
   responses, and calcium- and cAMP-mediated signaling, whereas multiple
   olfactory receptor genes were down-regulated by cocaine treatment. ADF
   abolished many of the effects of cocaine on OB gene expression. Our
   findings reveal that dietary energy intake modifies the neural
   substrates underlying some of the behavioral and physiological responses
   to repeated cocaine treatment, and also suggest novel roles for the
   olfactory system in addiction. The data further suggest that
   modification of dietary energy intake could provide a novel potential
   approach to addiction treatments.}},

Month = {{JUL-DEC}},
Abstract = {{An attempt has been made here to delineate the manifold facets of the
   development story, or the under-development to which this eight per cent
   of the Indian population has been subjected to. The tribal conception of
   the inanimate world-agriculture, forest, land, water needs
   transformation. They have to realize that methods of traditional
   agronomic practices alone cannot support them. Yet, the vagaries of
   modern capital-intensive, commercialized agriculture are too risky for
   them as they overwhelmingly belong to the category of small and marginal
   farmers. The various development plans have left a mixed impression on
   the minds of the tribal people. They cannot forget their loss of land,
   their heavy indebtedness, the usury of money-lenders, the daily
   exploitation by contractors, traders, whereby thousands of our tribal
   men and women-folk labour under the system of bonded-labour and a
   curtailment of forest rights and privileges. The development schemes'
   followed by the Government in the form of I.T.D.P, the T.S.P and M.A.D.A
   have failed to augment their income generational capacity on a
   sustainable basis. Consequently, schemes, which are considered as
   success stories by government agencies fail to empower the tribals in a
   real sense, for once the project period is completed, and the technical
   staff cum grass-root workers move out, the apparent statistical
   improvement in the tribals' income-generation abilities rapidly falls,
   and he is back to his old support base of the parasitical money-lender.
   The tribal person has to grapple on a daily basis with a fight for his
   day to day sustenance, and his poverty and lack of know-how of modern
   techniques of production makes him trapped in a perpetual
   subsistence-based economy. They are oriented to tasks, whether it be for
   sustenance or otherwise, which requires group dynamics to succeed, be it
   hunting, food-gathering, folk dancing etc. Thus, tasks requiring
   individual skill, risk, competition, innovation are alien to their
   personality make up. It is high time that development efforts include
   not only elevating the tribal people from their income deficit through
   micro-credit means but the severe deprivation which they suffer on all
   parameters of health and food security is also taken care of. The
   macro-economic policies of the government, however, fail to inspire any
   confidence, since from the late nineties, both long-term loans for
   infrastructural improvement and short-term crop-loans have fallen down
   drastically, and the loans to small and marginal farmers diminished too.
   The tribal youth of today has also become materialistic oriented, and,
   yet, his skill and education levels are not allowing him to access the
   very best in life. His harmony with nature has been disrupted, and he is
   caught between his admiration for the sophistication of urban lifestyle,
   and his rootedness in ancient traditions and practices.}},

Abstract = {{For small tube-building amphipods that live on the algae they consume,
   food and habitat are tightly linked. This study compared two closely
   related amphipods to determine whether the species' algal preferences
   are based on the food value of the algae or on some other aspect of
   their algal habitat. Ampithoe lacertosa and Peramphithoe humeralis are
   both abundant on Shannon Point beach (Anacortes, Washington, USA; 48A
   degrees 30.542' N, 122A degrees 41.070' W) but specialize on different
   algae. In observations and laboratory experiments conducted
   July-September 1997, 2007, and 2008, the two species exhibited markedly
   different choices of food and habitat when offered six common
   macroalgae. Ampithoe lacertosa ate all algae offered, but preferentially
   built tubes on the green alga Ulva lactuca. Survival was relatively low
   among juveniles maintained on single species diets, except when they
   were fed Mazzaella splendens. Conversely, P. humeralis consumed
   primarily the brown kelp Saccharina latissima, Alaria marginata, and
   Desmarestia ligulata and preferred those species for tube building.
   Juvenile P. humeralis could not survive on a diet of U. lactuca or M.
   splendens. While A. lacertosa builds simple, temporary tubes and
   relocates frequently, P. humeralis is a highly thigmotactic species that
   builds long-term, complex tubes on the alga it prefers to eat. Feeding
   and habitat preferences of the two species were not clearly linked to
   nitrogen content of the algae, C:N ratio, or toughness of the algal
   tissue. Instead, preferences of the species may be related to their
   mobility and the permanence of the tubes they build. Ampithoe lacertosa
   and P. humeralis also use different feeding strategies; the former
   appears to mix algae to produce a high-quality diet, while the latter is
   more selective and has a capacity for compensatory feeding. The species
   are abundant on the same protected rocky shores, but specialize on
   different algae for habitat and food. Results suggest that the
   nutritional requirements of these sympatric mesograzers differ
   considerably and even closely related species can exhibit divergent
   behavioral strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation causes negative population trends or even local
   extinction in many species. Understanding the role of fragmentation on
   behavior and space use of animals is an essential part of revealing the
   mechanism behind observed population declines. We studied experimentally
   the effects of small-scale habitat fragmentation on the distribution and
   movement of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in seminatural enclosures. We
   predicted that besides habitat structure, availability of two resources,
   food for both sexes, and receptive females for males, determine
   individual distribution. We manipulated female density (either 0, 4, or
   12 per enclosure) and followed movements of radio-collared males. We
   also studied the effect of unequal food distribution between the
   fragments on vole distribution. The habitat of 0.25-ha enclosures was
   manipulated by forming either one large, two medium-sized, or four small
   habitat patches surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Female density and
   distribution clearly affected male spacing behavior. Males had larger
   home ranges in the medium female density enclosures. Furthermore, the
   use of the inhospitable and risky matrix area increased with habitat
   fragmentation. Food supplementation improved individual condition
   measured as body mass but did not affect breeding success. Our
   experiments demonstrated that both small-scale habitat fragmentation and
   resource distribution affect the behavior and condition of individuals.
   Increased fragmentation led to increased risk taking in both mating and
   foraging behavior. This should have direct survival and fitness
   consequences, and therefore our results may be extrapolated to
   population-level consequences of habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological novelties are lineage-specific traits that serve new
   functions(1,2). Developmental polyphenisms have been proposed to be
   facilitators of phenotypic evolution, but little is known about the
   interplay between the associated genetic and environmental
   factors(3-11). Here, we study two alternative morphologies in the mouth
   of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and the formation of teeth-like
   structures that are associated with bacteriovorous feeding and predatory
   behaviour on fungi and other worms(12-16). These teeth-like denticles
   represent an evolutionary novelty, which is restricted to some members
   of the nematode family Diplogastridae but is absent from Caenorhabditis
   elegans and related nematodes(14). We show that the mouth dimorphism is
   a polyphenism that is controlled by starvation and the co-option of an
   endocrine switch mechanism. Mutations in the nuclear hormone receptor
   DAF-12 and application of its ligand, the sterol hormone dafachronic
   acid, strongly influence this switch mechanism. The dafachronic
   acid-DAF-12 module has been shown to control the formation of arrested
   dauer larvae in both C. elegans and P. pacificus, as well as related
   life-history decisions in distantly related nematodes(17-20). The
   comparison of dauer formation and mouth morphology switch reveals that
   different thresholds of dafachronic acid signalling provide specificity.
   This study shows how hormonal signalling acts by coupling environmental
   change and genetic regulation and identifies dafachronic acid as a key
   hormone in nematode evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Risk is a fundamental driver of prey behaviour, but the importance of
   risk in the decision-making processes of top predators is poorly
   understood. We investigated the functions of vigilance behaviour in wild
   spotted hyaenas. These large carnivores have few predators but face
   frequent threats of attack and food theft by conspecifics. We made
   repeated observations of vigilance behaviour by hyaenas when they were
   resting, feeding and nursing, and examined variation due to age, group
   size, social rank, and factors related to predation risk. We used these
   observations to test whether vigilance functions in hyaenas to detect
   prey, mates, conspecific threats or interspecific threats, and whether
   functions differ between juveniles and adults. We found that adults were
   more vigilant than juveniles in all contexts. Vigilance by adults was
   greatest when nursing, but nursing females reduced their vigilance as
   cubs matured. Among both age groups, vigilance decreased with increasing
   group size, and hyaenas were less vigilant when feeding on high-quality
   food than when feeding on low-quality food. Social rank did not affect
   vigilance in either age group. Individual adults, but not juveniles,
   showed consistent patterns of vigilance within, but not between,
   behavioural contexts. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the
   primary function of vigilance in hyaenas is to detect interspecific
   threats. Furthermore, vigilance was context specific, and adult hyaenas
   showed individual variation in vigilance within behavioural contexts.

Abstract = {{Among mammals, social ranking is generally thought to affect the outcome
   of disputes over preferred, limited or future resources. Therefore, we
   should expect individuals' preference for conspecifics to be affected by
   their own and other individuals' competition capacity. Here, we
   investigated the social preference and behavioural response in farmed
   silver fox vixens (Vulpes vulpes) towards unfamiliar vixens of different
   competition capacities, measured by their ability to compete for and
   defend a limited food resource, in a choice test. We found that low
   competition capacity vixens spent significantly less time in front of
   the high competition capacity vixens (2647 +/- 600 s) compared to the
   time they spent in front of the low competition capacity vixens (6041
   +/- 877 s, P < 0.05). in addition, the low competition capacity vixens
   spent significantly less time in front of the high competition capacity
   vixens (2647 +/- 600 s) compared to what the high competition capacity
   vixens did (4215 +/- 657 s, P = 0.03). This suggests that low
   competition capacity vixens perceive high competition capacity vixens as
   a greater potential threat than high competition capacity vixens do.
   Time spent in social exploration, resting, sitting and performing
   aggressive behaviours in front of a stimulus animal were also affected
   by competition capacity of the foxes. The vixens were also retreating
   significantly more from the high competition capacity vixens (2 +/- 0.8
   times) than from the low competition capacity vixens (0.4 +/- 0.4 times,
   P = 0.03), possibly reflecting that the high competition capacity vixens
   were more offensive than the low competition capacity vixens. Our
   results contribute to the knowledge of social behaviour in this species,

   foxes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Collective animal behaviour has attracted much attention recently, but
   cause-and-effect within interaction sequences has often been difficult
   to establish. To tackle this problem, we constructed a robotic fish
   ('Robofish') with which three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus
   aculeatus L.) interact. Robofish is a computer-controlled replica
   stickleback that can be programmed to move around a tank. First, we
   demonstrated the functioning of the method: that the sticklebacks
   interacted with Robofish. We examined two types of interaction:
   recruitment and leadership. We found that Robofish could recruit a
   single fish from a refuge and could initiate a turn in singletons and in
   groups of ten, i.e. act as a leader. We also showed that the influence
   of Robofish diminished after the first 30 min that fish spent in a new
   environment. Second, using this method, we investigated the effects of
   metric and topological inter-individual distance on the influence that
   Robofish had on the orientation of fish in a shoal of ten. We found that
   inter-individual interactions during this turn were predominantly
   mediated by topological, rather than metric, distance. Finally, we
   discussed the potential of this novel method and the importance of our

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major health challenge facing the modern world. Some

   high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are
   associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or

   physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie
   intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human
   physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot
   every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism.
   Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers
   efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these
   critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle.
   The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and

Abstract = {{Among other strategies to improve fish welfare in rearing environment,
   domestication and/or selective breeding was proposed to minimize fish
   responsiveness to husbandry practices. To verify this hypothesis on a
   recently domesticated specie, the sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, L., an
   experiment was realized, using four populations differing according to
   their level of domestication or selection: one population produced from
   wild parents (Wild), one population produced from parents domesticated
   for one generation (Domesticated) and two produced from parents selected
   for growth for one generation (Selected A and Selected B). The
   experiment was carried out over 91 days with 600 fish (50 fish per tank,
   150 fish per population). After a control period, the fish were
   submitted from day 35 and during 56 days to a stress treatment including
   frequent and random application of 4 acute stressors (pursuing fish with
   a net during 1 min, switching off the light for 2 s during the day or,
   conversely, switching on the light for 2 s during the night, and
   overflying a bird predator silhouette above the tank during 30 s). The
   two variables that were measured, i.e.: fish self-feeding behavior and
   growth performance {[}at days (D) 14, 35, 63, and 91] were both altered,
   albeit differentially according to populations, by the stress treatment.
   During the first stress period (from D35 to D63), all groups modified
   their feeding rhythm and highly increased their feed intake while their
   growth rate decreased (Domesticated and both Selected fish groups) or
   remained stable (Wild). During the second stress period (from D64 to
   D91) fish continued to modify their feeding rhythm (being more and more
   diurnal) and increased again their feed intake; conversely to what
   happened during the first stress period, here, these modifications were
   associated with an improvement of the growth rate of all populations.
   During the whole experiment, both Selected groups and Domesticated fish
   were always characterized by a higher body mass, specific growth rate
   and body condition factor than Wild fish. In conclusion, and according
   to the results of this study, a first generation of domestication or
   selection improved fish growth performance but, at this early stage do
   not modify behavioral responses to repeated acute stress exposure. (C)

Abstract = {{Inducible defense, which is phenotypic plasticity in traits that affect
   predation risk, is taxonomically widespread and has been shown to have
   important ecological consequences. However, it remains unclear what
   factors promote the evolution of qualitatively different defense
   strategies and when evolution should favor strategies that involve
   modification of multiple traits. Previous theory suggests that
   individual-level trade-offs play a key role in defense evolution, but
   most of this work has assumed that trade-offs are independent. Here we
   show that the shape of the behavioral trade-off between foraging gain
   and predation risk determines the interaction between this trade-off and
   the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction. The
   interaction between these fundamental trade-offs determines the optimal
   investment into behavioral and life-history defenses. Highly nonlinear
   foraging-predation risk trade-offs favor the evolution of behavioral
   defenses, while linear trade-offs favor life-history defenses. Between
   these extremes, integrated defense responses are optimal, with defense
   expression strongly depending on ontogeny. We suggest that these
   predictions may be general across qualitatively different defenses. Our
   results have important implications for theory on the ecological effects
   of inducible defense, which has not considered how qualitatively
   different defenses might alter ecological interactions.}},

   done to determine the ability of the hypogean cyprinid Phreatichthys
   andruzzii Vinciguerra, 1924 to memorize a synthetic chemical cue
   (morpholine, C(4)H(9)NO), to associate it with an area, to utilize such
   information for direct locomotory activity, and to determine how long
   that association is retained in fish memory. Although morpholine acts as
   neutral stimulus for P. andruzzii, after acclimation in
   morpholine-scented areas devoid of food resources specimens showed a
   clear tendency to avoid waters characterized by the odour of that
   chemical. We hypothesize that an association between odours and trophic
   characteristics of an area allows the fish to optimize their exploratory
   activity, as it allows them to recognize areas already experienced to be
   devoid of trophic resources and to avoid these as unprofitable places.
   The above association seems to be memorized for a short time; the
   behavioural response vanishing between 6 and 18 h after the end of the
   acclimation period. After a certain time has elapsed, it could be
   profitable to visit the same areas again to verify the incidental
   availability of new food sources.}},

Abstract = {{In many taxa the timing of metamorphosis is plastic in response to
   predation risk during the pre-metamorphic stage, and trends in both age
   and body size at metamorphosis have been the subject of much study. The
   responses to cues of predators are predominantly to be larger or
   equal-sized at the same age or older at metamorphosis. These
   observations are in direct contrast with existing theoretical treatments
   of this plasticity, which mostly predict earlier and smaller
   metamorphosis and never later and larger metamorphosis without invoking
   indirect effects on growth rate. Here we resolve the discrepancy between
   theory and observation using a dynamic state-dependent model that
   incorporates morphological and behavioral responses to predation risk.
   We allow prey to choose the optimal activity level and/or investment in
   defense over the growth period. We show that under certain conditions,
   metamorphosis at a larger size and later time is likely to be optimal.
   Our analysis allows us to make testable predictions about the changes in
   activity level of prey as they grow and how the effect of providing
   refuges will vary with predator type. Several of these predictions are
   supported by a meta-analysis of metamorphic responses to caged predators
   by larval amphibians and insects. Our predictions lead to insights about
   the feedback effects of antipredator responses on growth and subsequent
   implications for life history.}},

Abstract = {{The genic capture model offers a promising solution to the lek paradox.
   Heightened condition dependency of sexually selected traits is a
   prerequisite of this model. Condition dependency is empirically inferred
   by the sensitivity of traits to stressors. The magnitude of ecological
   stress (e.g., competition and predation) experienced by populations
   varies considerably. Thus, condition dependence should manifest more in
   populations experiencing higher levels of stress. We experimentally
   assessed the sensitivity of a sexually selected trait (posterior
   gnathopod) to food resource stress in an amphipod species. We found that
   gnathopod size variation was 59\% higher under food stress, with no
   corresponding effect on nonsexually selected traits. In addition, we
   assessed levels of gnathopod variation and the allometry of gnathopods
   for males sampled from natural populations for two amphipod species that
   experience different levels of stress (driven by contrasting
   size-selective predation and associated life-history trade-offs).
   Populations that experience higher resource stress had both steeper
   allometries and greater gnathopod size variation. These results suggest
   that the magnitude of ecological stress experienced by natural
   populations strongly impacts condition dependency of sexually selected
   traits, and could play an important role in shaping trait variation and
   thus the opportunity for sexual selection.}},

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{599-605}},

Abstract = {{Proximate mediators of reproductive behaviors in vertebrates have a long
   history of study. In fishes, relatively few studies have focused on
   hormonal control of parental care, despite a comprehensive background on
   the general physiology of fishes, and the frequent occurrence of
   parental care behaviors. Studies on this taxon have repeatedly found
   that the relationships between androgens and paternal care do not follow
   the predictions made in the avian and mammalian literature.
   Glucocorticoids may also have a role in mediating parental behaviors,
   possibly through their role as regulators of metabolism. As such, we
   investigated the role of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and cortisol in
   mediating parental effort of male smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu)
   by manipulating hormone titers in wild fish. In smallmouth bass, males
   spawn annually with a single female and defend a single brood for up to
   30 days. Treatment of parental fish with cyproterone acetate (CYA; an
   androgen receptor antagonist) resulted in a decrease in nest defense in
   response to a simulated brood predator; however, no changes in nest
   success, nest tending or biochemical indicators of nutritional status
   were detected. Treatment with exogenous cortisol did not change parental
   behavior, but did increase the rate of nest failure, possibly owing to
   the energetic cost of chronically elevated cortisol concentrations. We
   discuss these findings in the context of resource-driven trade-offs and
   highlight life history as an important factor controlling parental
   effort in species with costly parental care behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   10.1152/jn.00340.2010. Rats use their vibrissa (whiskers) to explore and
   navigate the environment. These sensory signals are distributed within
   the brain stem by the trigeminal complex and are also relayed to the
   superior colliculus in the midbrain and to the thalamus (and
   subsequently barrel cortex) in the forebrain. In the intermediate layers
   of the superior colliculus, whisker-evoked responses are driven by
   direct inputs from the trigeminal complex (trigeminotectal) and feedback
   from the barrel cortex (corticotectal). But the effects of the
   behavioral state of the animal on the spontaneous firing and sensory
   responses of these neurons are unknown. By recording from freely
   behaving rats, we show that the spontaneous firing of whisker sensitive
   neurons in superior colliculus is higher, or in an activated mode,
   during active exploration and paradoxical sleep and much lower, or in a
   quiescent/deactivated mode, during awake immobility and slow-wave sleep.
   Sensory evoked responses in superior colliculus also depend on
   behavioral state. Most notably, feedback corticotectal responses are
   significantly larger during the quiescent/deactivated mode, which tracks
   the barrel cortex responses on which they depend. Finally, sensory
   evoked responses depend not only on the state of the animal but also on
   the orienting response elicited by the stimulus, which agrees with the
   well known role of the superior colliculus in orienting about salient
   stimuli.}},

   In doing so, animals can accrue immediate benefits by manipulating (or
   helping) individuals with whom they are currently interacting and
   delayed benefits by convincing bystanders that they are more fit or
   cooperative than perhaps is warranted. In this paper, I provide some
   illustrative examples of how bystanders could apply added positive
   selection pressure on both cooperative behaviour and dishonest
   signalling during courtship or conflict. I also discuss how the presence
   of bystanders might select for greater flexibility in behavioural
   strategies (e.g. conditional or condition dependence), which could
   maintain dishonesty at evolutionarily stable frequencies under some
   ecological conditions. By recognizing bystanders as a significant

   (Zenaida aurita) on 12 territories with two learning tests in their
   natural habitat in Barbados. The dove pairs showed high site fidelity
   and territoriality, allowing us to test individuals repeatedly while
   accounting for the effects of territorial chases and pair bonds on our
   learning measures. We used a foraging apparatus that enabled Zenaida
   doves to access seed, yet excluded other species, and measured doves'
   performance on colour discrimination and reversal learning tests. We
   found that (1) doves on all 12 territories passed the two tests; (2)
   mates within a pair were consistently solvers or scroungers; (3) sex,
   body condition and territorial chases did not consistently affect
   learning rates; (4) tameness was a significant negative predictor of
   learning to feed from the foraging apparatus and (5) scrounging within
   pairs seemed to facilitate learning. Our study presents a method to

Abstract = {{Objective: This exploratory study examines the role of

   Method: One hundred and twenty women were enrolled into the study. Blood
   samples were collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH.
   Participants completed questionnaires that included the Perceived Stress
   Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, the
   Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety (PAS) Scale, the Norbeck Social Support
   Questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test, the Brief COPE scale, and
   questions regarding violence/abuse, and work, sleep, and nutritional
   patterns. Results: Pregnant women with high CRH levels (15 pcg/ml and
   above) perceived their income to be inadequate, slept more hours at
   night, stood more hours during the day, and used the coping styles of
   disengagement or religion but not humor. Logistic regression identified
   three predictors for high CRH (accounting for 42.2\% of the variance):
   perceived inadequacy of income and the use of `'religion'' and
   `'disengagement'' to cope with stress. Conclusions: These results are
   the first known to identify coping style and perceived income inadequacy
   as predictors of high CRH. Women with perceived inadequacy of income had
   almost three times the odds for high CRH. Women who used religion or
   disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7 times the odds for
   high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are associated with
   preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include maternal
   coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future

Abstract = {{Dieting is an important risk factor for disordered eating and eating
   disorders. Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from dieting and
   restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and finally clinical
   eating disorders. The prevalence of eating disorders is increased in

   related to (a) perception of the paradigm of appearance in the specific
   sport, (b) perceived performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural
   pressures for thinness or an ``ideal{''} body. Athletes most at risk for
   disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin body
   size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports utilizing weight
   categories, such as in some high-intensity sports. In addition to
   dieting, personality factors, pressure to lose weight, frequent weight
   cycling, early start of sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries,
   and unfortunate coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To
   prevent disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to
   practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and parents must

   deficits independently associated with each of these risk factors and to
   explore associated mechanisms of any observed impairments. Learning was
   evaluated using a multiple schedule of repeated learning and performance
   in female rats subjected to lifetime Pb exposure (0 or 50 ppm Pb in
   drinking water beginning in dams 2 months prior to breeding; blood Pb
   levels similar to 10 mu g/dl), to prenatal restraint stress on

   particularly the number of responses to correctly learn response
   sequences, were further enhanced by stress, whereas performance measures
   were unimpaired. Statistical analyses indicated significant
   relationships among corticosterone levels, frontal cortex dopamine (DA),
   nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover, and total responses required to
   learn sequences. This study demonstrates that Pb and stress can act
   together to produce selective and highly condition-dependent deficits in

   also underscore the critical need to evaluate toxicants in the context

   Mosquitoes Aedes triseriatus (Say) and Auks albopictus (Skuse) encounter
   predatory Corethrella appendiculata (Grabham) and Toxorhynchites rutilus
   (Coquillett) in small containers and show antipredatory behavioral
   responses. We investigated the sources of the predation cues to which
   these prey larvae respond. We tested whether Ae. albopictus larvae show
   behavioral responses to cues emanating from the predator or from damage
   to prey caused by the act of predation. We also tested whether Ae.
   triseriatus respond to cues present in fluid or solid residues from
   predator activity. Ae. albopictus showed behavioral modifications only
   in response to waterborne cues from a feeding predator and not to cues
   from a starving predator, indicating that Ae. albopictus respond to cues
   created by the act of predation, which could include substances derived
   from damaged prey or substances in predator feces. Ae. triseriatus
   showed behavioral responses to solid residues from predation but not to
   fluid without those solids, indicating that the cues to which they
   respond originate in predator feces or uneaten prey body parts. Our
   results suggest that cues in this system may be primarily chemicals that
   are detected upon contact with solid residues that are products of the
   feeding processes of these predators.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Based on mathematical models, antipredator defence mechanisms are
   commonly believed to have stabilizing effects on communities. However,
   empirical data are still lacking.
   2. We tested stabilizing effects of an inducible vertical migration
   defence in two Daphnia pulex clones in a 5-week field enclosure
   experiment. A defended (migrated down into darker water layers in the
   presence of fish chemicals in both laboratory and field experiments) and
   non-defended (no ability to react to fish chemicals) clone were directly
   exposed to fish predators and compared to control enclosures (no fish).
   3. In the absence of planktivorous fish, both defended and non-defended
   clones exhibited boom-and-bust dynamics, probably owing to
   over-exploitation of the food source. Predation almost led to extinction
   of the non-defended Daphnia clone during the experiment and the fish,
   deprived of food, lost weight. However, the population density of the
   defended clone was stable and it did not over-exploit the algal food
   source, while there was a continuous supply of food to the fish, which
   consequently gained weight.
   4. We conclude that both consumptive and non-consumptive (also called
   non-lethal or trait-mediated) predator effects, coupled with prey
   defences, are key contributors to prey stability. This has a positive
   effect on both the predator and the food organism of the prey.}},

Abstract = {{In nestlings, glucocorticoid (GC) secretion has short-term and long-term
   fitness consequences. For example, short-time elevations trigger begging
   activity, whereas chronically elevated GC levels impair body condition,
   growth and cognitive abilities. Despite a growing body of literature on
   personality traits, the effects of selection for fast and slow
   exploration on GC secretion have received little attention. We compared
   baseline and stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
   activity of hand-reared great tit nestlings of lines selected for fast
   and slow exploration. Nestling droppings were collected under three
   conditions: control, test (following handling stress, day 14 after
   hatching) and the following day. The concentrations of excreted
   immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CM) were determined via an
   enzyme immunoassay. We also observed nestlings' begging behaviour. CM
   differed significantly between the lines. Nestlings of the fast line
   excreted lower CM than slow-line birds. In response to handling stress,
   nestlings excreted significantly higher concentrations of CM than during
   the control and on the day after handling. Sex and begging activity were
   not related to CM levels. Under the control condition, but not after
   handling, males begged significantly more often than females. In both
   lines, adults excreted significantly less CM compared to nestlings. Both
   nestlings and adults of the slow line produced higher baseline CM values
   than fast-line birds. Fast-line nestlings excreted lower baseline CM
   than nestlings of a wild population not selected for fast or slow
   exploration. Slow-line nestlings did not. Our results show that
   selection on the basis of exploratory behaviour affected HPA axis

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animals often alter their behaviour, morphology and physiology in the
   presence of predators. These induced defences can be fine-tuned by a
   variety of environmental factors such as predator species, acute
   predation risk or food availability. It has, however, remained unclear
   what cues influence the extent and quality of induced defences and how
   the information content of these cues interact to determine the
   development of antipredator defences. We performed an experiment to
   study the significance of direct chemical cues, originating from the
   predators themselves, and indirect cues, released by attacked or
   consumed prey, for phenotypic responses in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We
   reared tadpoles in the presence of caged predators (Triturus vulgaris,
   Aeshna cyanea) fed either one or three tadpoles every other day outside
   the tadpole-rearing tanks. Fifteen hours after food provisioning,
   predators were put back into the tanks containing focal tadpoles either
   after washing (direct + digestion-released cues) or with the water
   containing remnants of the prey (direct + all types of indirect cues).
   Our results suggest that direct cues together with digestion-released
   cues can be sufficient to induce strong antipredator responses. Induced
   defences depended on both direct cues, affecting predator-specific
   responses, and the quantity of indirect cues, resulting in graded
   responses to differences in predation threat. Moreover, direct and
   indirect cues interacted in behaviour, resulting in predator-specific
   graded responses. We also observed a decrease in the extent of
   predator-induced responses in large tadpoles as compared to small ones.
   Our results, thus, suggest that prey integrate multiple cues about
   predators to optimize induced defences and that this process changes
   during ontogeny.}},

Pages = {{535-542}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this second paper of the Brain, Drugs and Genes review we would like
   to discuss illicit drugs and the genetics that may predispose subjects
   to addiction.
   We describe the effects, action sites and pathophysiological
   consequences of the use of these illicit drugs. The drugs that are
   reviewed are marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA, also known as ecstasy. All of
   them cause an effect on the brain, modifying the activity of the
   neuronal systems, altering the activity or availability of the
   neurotransmitters or emulating their actions. The risk of dependence is
   related to the velocity with which these drugs induce plastic changes in
   the brain, very much like a learning process. Such changes underlie the
   patient's dependerce to drugs. Therefore when a long term user quits and
   deprives the brain abruptly of these drugs, an abstinence syndrome is
   precipitated and it may be quite severe. Only for marijuana it seems to
   be mild, misleading people to believe this drug does not cause physical
   dependence.
   Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) is a plant which has its active principle
   Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in almost all its parts, i.e. the
   flowers, stems, seeds and leaves. It actually contains over 60
   cannobinoids as well as other chemical compounds. Marijuana causes
   euphoria followed by relaxation and several other reinforcing effects.
   Among the adverse effects marijuana causes: alteration of short-term
   memory, slowness of reflexes, depression and anxiety, bronchitis and
   lung infections. Marijuana effects depend on the activation of the CB1
   and CB2 receptors, distributed in the entire body. The CBI receptor is
   mainly present in the brain. In medicine, Delta 9-THC has been useful in
   treating symptoms caused by chemotherapy, and in treating the anorexia
   caused by the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Also, an antagonist
   of the CB1 receptor, Rimonabant, has been used to treat morbid obesity
   with certain degree of success. However, despite this promising
   application of Rimonabant, the side effects it caused led to its
   withdrawal from the market in Europe, Canada and Mexico.
   Heroin, derived from morphine, which in turn is isolated from opium,
   causes euphoria and analgesia, suppresses hunger, increases energy and
   induces sleepiness. The adverse effects are liver and kidney diseases as
   well as a decrease in breathing and heart rates. This drug acts on the
   opioid receptors: MOR, DOR and KOR. Cocaine, derived from the coca plant
   (Erythroxylum coca) produces immediate rewarding effects that last
   between 30 to 60 min, and causes anxiety once its serum concentration
   drops. Due to its very short half-life, it is the most addictive of all
   drugs. Cocaine reduces hunger, thirst and sleep. The most used forms of
   cocaine are powder and crack (available as rock). The mechanism of
   action by which cocaine and related compounds induce their effects is
   the blockade of the dopamine transporter at the synapsis, leaving
   dopamine available for a longer time at the synapses of the
   motivation-reward system. Cocaine and related compounds induce blood
   vessel constriction, muscular spasm, chest pain, and an increase in
   heart rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk of cardiac
   arrest and stroke.
   The methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant, is a crystalline, odorless,
   bitter drug which causes a pleasant feeling and euphoria. Its action
   mechanism is the blockade of the dopamine transporter, same as cocaine.
   The effects pursued by the users of crystal methamphetamine are
   increased alertness, increase in physical activity and decrease in
   hunger. Its side effects include increase in body temperature, heart
   rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk for stroke.
   Methamphetamine also triggers violent behavior, anxiety, irritability,
   confusion, paranoia and hallucinations. This compound has been used for
   medical reasons, such as in the treatment of narcolepsy and obesity.
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA or ecstasy, is a synthetic
   compound with stimulant and hallucinatory effects. Its action is exerted
   mainly on the serotonin transporter, leaving serotonin available at the
   synapsis for a longer time. After clearance from the bloodstream this
   drug causes severe depression. Ecstasy is also combined with other
   stimulants.
   All the drugs discussed here induce body changes that compromise the
   life of the user, or his health at the very least. Despite this fact,
   the highly reinforcing effects the drugs produce by over activating the
   motivation-rewarding system compel their repetitive use. Not all users,
   however, are equally vulnerable to becoming addicted or respond the same
   way to the use of drugs. The individual response depends, in part, on
   genetic factors, as we discuss in the following section.
   It is evident that not only environmental factors account for the
   vulnerability to addiction. Genetic factors also have a substantial
   contribution. In order to facilitate the understanding of the
   interaction environment-gene, we define the following concepts: gene,
   allele, mutation, polymorphism, heritability and epigenesis. Apparently,
   the genetic contribution to addiction vulnerability varies depending on
   the drug. For example, cocaine and opiates are much more dependant on
   genetic factors to trigger addiction than are nicotine, alcohol or
   marijuana. Mutations or polymorphisms carried by several genes might
   make the difference between being at high or low risk for addiction.
   They may also underlie the degree of response to rehabilitation
   treatments.
   Addiction, then, is a result of an interaction between environment and
   genes. Environmental demands make the organism modify its structure and
   physiology in order to cope efficiently to such demands. One crucial way
   to do so is by changing gene expression. Changes in gene expression may
   be a consequence of chemical rearrangements in the chromatin structure,
   which lead to transcriptional modifications that affect the expression
   of the proteins the genes encode. Consequently, the normal functions of
   such proteins in different systems are also altered. These adaptive
   rearrangements in the chromatin structure are called epigenesis. The
   epigenetic changes induced by environmental stimuli have been proved to
   affect the expression of several neurotransmitter receptors and trophic
   factors, among many other molecules crucial for the proper functioning
   of the Central Nervous System. Hence, these chromatin's structural
   changes, triggered by environmental demands, are most likely to help the
   subject cope with such specific demands. However, this adaptation is not
   free of charge, and requires a toll to be paid which is: vulnerability
   to addiction.
   Finally, one question arises: Who is the person most likely to seek a
   drug of abuse? Statistics have shown that those patients suffering from
   a psychiatric illness. This hypothesis suggests that addiction is a
   symptom or a disease caused by a psychiatric illness such as a
   personality disorder, depression or schizophrenia. Hence, at the end,
   drug addiction would be a co-morbid entity, generating what in Spanish
   we call the dual-disease. On the other hand, the self-medication
   hypothesis also makes sense, at least for an extensive group of
   patients. This hypothesis suggests that patients take drugs of abuse to
   relief the symptoms caused by their psychiatric pathology.
   The present review discusses the interaction between brain circuits,
   drugs and genes to generate an addict patient. We do not intend to
   revise each field exhaustively, but rather we intend to give the reader
   a general scenario on the convergence of these three worlds. Thus it may
   be better understood how addiction develops and how it may be treated.}},

Abstract = {{The family, as the basic social unit, has a decisive role in the health
   and disease of its members. It is the primary unit where health needs
   are formed and solved. By its own resources the family independently
   resolves about 75\% of the total health requirements. In the paper the
   authors study family characteristics which influence family health and
   diseases, indicators of family health and the scale of life values.
   Also, the study evaluates social factors, communication and the
   influence of the usage of psychoactive substances on family health and
   the quality of family life. To form the personality of a child three
   factors are most significant: love, the feeling of safety and the
   presence of harmonious relationship between the parents. Life harmony in
   a family also depends on the quality of structural components of the
   personality and the interaction of motivation of its members. Early
   childhood determines the future personality of the adult person. At that
   period, habits and partially attitudes are formed. In harmonious family
   relationships the parents are the role model to children. Verbal and
   non-verbal communication enrich the relationship among people and enable
   efforts in supporting understanding, compassion and care for others by
   mutual agreement. On the scale of life values of Serbian citizens health
   holds the first position. Immediately following the health issue is good
   relationship in the family. As healthcare is not only the task of
   healthcare services, but also of each individual, family and the society
   as a whole, it is on healthcare personnel to educate the citizens how to
   preserve and improve their own health and the health of their family by
   a continual healthcare and education. Above all, this concerns avoidance
   of bad habits, such as smoking, immoderate alcohol consumption, narcotic
   abuse, physical inactivity, hypercaloric nutrition, etc. Also, it is
   significant to make an early recognition of disease symptoms and to turn
   for help to the chosen doctor on time. Family medicine and family
   doctors can in the best way, entirely and continually, prevent and treat
   numerous diseases occurring as the result of family dysfunction, with
   active participation of each individual, family, healthcare services and
   the community.}},

   behaviour: implications for the prevention of childhood obesity}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: A number of risk factors are associated with the development
   of childhood obesity which can be identified during infancy. These
   include infant feeding practices, parental response to infant
   temperament and parental perception of infant growth and appetite.
   Parental beliefs and understanding are crucial determinants of infant
   feeding behaviour; therefore any intervention would need to take account
   of their views. This study aimed to explore UK parents' beliefs
   concerning their infant's size, growth and feeding behaviour and
   parental receptiveness to early intervention aimed at reducing the risk
   of childhood obesity.
   Method: Six focus groups were undertaken in a range of different
   demographic localities, with parents of infants less than one year of
   age. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and
   thematic analysis applied using an interpretative, inductive approach.
   Results: 38 parents (n = 36 female, n = 2 male), age range 19-45 years
   (mean 30.1 years, SD 6.28) participated in the focus groups. 12/38 were
   overweight (BMI 25-29.99) and 8/38 obese (BMI >30). Five main themes
   were identified. These were a) parental concern about breast milk,
   infant contentment and growth; b) the belief that the main cause of
   infant distress is hunger is widespread and drives inappropriate
   feeding; c) rationalisation for infants' larger size; d) parental
   uncertainty about identifying and managing infants at risk of obesity
   and e) intentions and behaviour in relation to a healthy lifestyle.
   Conclusions: There are a number of barriers to early intervention with
   parents of infants at risk of developing obesity. Parents are receptive
   to prevention prior to weaning and need better support with best
   practice in infant feeding. In particular, this should focus on helping
   them understand the physiology of breast feeding, how to differentiate
   between infant distress caused by hunger and other causes and the timing
   of weaning. Some parents also need guidance about how to recognize and
   prepare healthy foods and facilitate physical activity for their
   infants.}},

   size, increase their reproductive output, and restore their energy
   reserves to levels comparable to those of females reared on high food as

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{879-887}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity can improve fitness in unstable environments and
   can be expressed in many traits, such as life history attributes, growth
   and behavioural features. Microhabitat choice can have important
   consequences for development and survival of aquatic organisms and is
   expected to vary in response to stimuli, such as predation risk, food
   availability and temperature. At seasonal sites, microhabitat
   availability and associated benefits may change from season to season,
   which might lead to altered patterns of microhabitat use by tadpoles. We
   investigated this hypothesis in 17 streams from two localities in
   south-eastern Brazil. We tested whether water level drops significantly
   during the dry season, whether lower water level results in altered
   microhabitat availability and whether predation risk changes between
   seasons, based on predator density. We then tested whether tadpoles
   change their pattern of microhabitat use, their spatial niche breadth
   (given by diversity of used microhabitats) and spatial niche overlap (in
   the case of co-occurring species). We were able to include in our
   analyses tadpoles of four species of Hylidae, that occurred throughout
   both seasons. Stream depth decreased in the dry season, but microhabitat
   availability remained relatively stable in many streams, and predator
   density did not change significantly. Tadpoles of three out of the four
   species studied were more abundant during the dry season, which may be
   an adaptation to adjust time of metamorphosis to the rainy season.
   Tadpoles changed their patterns of microhabitat use between seasons,
   although the potential causing factors investigated did not seem to be
   responsible. Tadpole plasticity in microhabitat use may indicate the

Abstract = {{Habituation to nonlethal predation stimuli may provide benefits for
   animals living in areas with frequent encounters with low-risk
   predators. On the other hand, individuals can be very consistent in
   their antipredator responses, with shy individuals showing greater
   degree of responsiveness than bold individuals. However, the link
   between habituation or boldness and individual benefits has not been
   thoroughly investigated. We established whether and how two behavioral
   components associated with antipredator responses (habituation and
   boldness, and their interaction) would influence body condition, which
   is a parameter related to fitness. We conducted an outdoor semi-natural
   experiment with Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica). Individual
   boldness was consistent across contexts, but we did not find any effect
   of boldness or the interaction between boldness and habituation on body
   condition. However, those individuals that habituated more readily to a
   frequent predatory stimulus were able to increase their body condition
   more relative to lizards that habituated less. This finding highlights
   the importance of individual differences in behavioral plasticity, which
   could influence traits related to fitness. Habituation can provide
   benefits for individuals exposed to low-risk predators; however,
   individuals more prone to habituation could also experience mortality
   costs by wrongly habituating to a dangerous predator.}},

Abstract = {{The indirect, ecosystem-level consequences of ocean fishing, and
   particularly the mechanisms driving them, are poorly understood. Most
   studies focus on density-mediated trophic cascades, where removal of
   predators alternately causes increases and decreases in abundances of
   lower trophic levels. However, cascades could also be driven by where
   and when prey forage rather than solely by prey abundance. Over a large
   gradient of fishing intensity in the central Pacific's remote northern
   Line Islands, including a nearly pristine, baseline coral reef system,
   we found that changes in predation risk elicit strong behavioral
   responses in foraging patterns across multiple prey fish species. These
   responses were observed as a function of both short-term ({''}acute'')
   risk and longer-term ({''}chronic'') risk, as well as when prey were
   exposed to model predators to isolate the effect of perceived predation
   risk from other potentially confounding factors. Compared to numerical
   prey responses, antipredator behavioral responses such as these can
   potentially have far greater net impacts (by occurring over entire
   assemblages) and operate over shorter temporal scales (with potentially
   instantaneous response times) in transmitting top-down effects. A rich
   body of literature exists on both the direct effects of human removal of
   predators from ecosystems and predators' effects on prey behavior. Our
   results draw together these lines of research and provide the first
   empirical evidence that large-scale human removal of predators from a
   natural ecosystem indirectly alters prey behavior. These behavioral
   changes may, in turn, drive previously unsuspected alterations in reef
   food webs.}},

Abstract = {{beta-Cyclocitral is often present in eutrophic waters and is a well
   known source of airborne and drinking water malodor, but its production
   and functional ecology are unresolved. This volatile organic compound
   (VOC) is derived from the catalytic breakdown of beta-carotene, and
   evidence indicates that it is produced by the activation of a specific
   carotene oxygenase by all species of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium
   Microcystis. Previous work has shown that beta-cyclocitral affects
   grazer behavior, but the nature of this interaction and its influence on
   predator-prey dynamics was unresolved. The present study combined
   analytical and behavioral studies to evaluate this interaction by using
   Microcystis NRC-1 and Daphnia magna. Results showed that
   beta-cyclocitral was undetectable in live Microcystis cells, or present
   only at extremely low concentrations (2.6 amol/cell). In contrast, cell
   rupture activated a rapid carotene oxygenase reaction, which produced
   high amounts (77+/-5.5 amol beta-cyclocitral/cell), corresponding to a
   calculated maximum intracellular concentration of 2.2 mM. The behavioral
   response of Daphnia magna to beta-cyclocitral was evaluated in a bbe (c)
   Daphnia toximeter, where beta-cyclocitral treatments induced a marked
   increase in swimming velocity. Acclimation took place within a few
   minutes, when Daphnia returned to normal swimming velocity while still
   exposed to beta-cyclocitral. The minimum VOC concentration (odor
   threshold) that elicited a significant grazer response was 750 nM
   beta-cyclocitral, some 2,900 times lower than the per capita yield of a
   growing Microcystis cell after activation. Under natural conditions,
   initial grazer-related or other mode of cell rupture would lead to the
   development of a robust beta-cyclocitral microzone around Microcystis
   colonies, thus acting as both a powerful repellent and signal of poor
   quality food to grazers.}},

Abstract = {{When experiencing resource competition or abrupt environmental change,
   animals often must transition rapidly from an ancestral diet to a novel,
   derived diet. Yet, little is known about the proximate mechanisms that
   mediate such rapid evolutionary transitions. Here, we investigated the
   role of diet-induced, cryptic genetic variation in facilitating the
   evolution of novel resource-use traits that are associated with a new
   feeding strategy-carnivory-in tadpoles of spadefoot toads (genus Spea).
   We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and
   fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a
   proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a
   vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals,
   mediates the expression of this variation. Specifically, we compared
   broad-sense heritabilities of tadpoles fed different diets or treated
   with exogenous corticosterone, and found that novel diets can expose
   cryptic genetic variation to selection, and that diet-induced hormones
   may play a role in revealing this variation. Our results therefore
   suggest that cryptic genetic variation may have enabled the evolutionary
   transition to carnivory in Spea tadpoles, and that such variation might
   generally facilitate rapid evolutionary transitions to novel diets.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals exhibit behavioural syndromes-consistent individual
   differences in behaviour across two or more contexts or situations.
   Here, we present adaptive, state-dependent mathematical models for
   analysing issues about behavioural syndromes. We find that asset
   protection (where individuals with more `assets' tend be more cautious)
   and starvation avoidance, two state-dependent mechanisms, can explain
   short-term behavioural consistency, but not long-term stable behavioural
   types (BTs). These negative-feedback mechanisms tend to produce
   convergence in state and behaviour over time. In contrast, a
   positive-feedback mechanism, state-dependent safety (where individuals
   with higher energy reserves, size, condition or vigour are better at
   coping with predators), can explain stable differences in personality
   over the long term. The relative importance of negative-and
   positive-feedback mechanisms in governing behavioural consistency
   depends on environmental conditions (predation risk and resource
   availability). Behavioural syndromes emerge more readily in conditions
   of intermediate ecological favourability (e. g. medium risk and medium
   resources, or high risk and resources, or low risk and resources). Under
   these conditions, individuals with higher initial state maintain a
   tendency to be bolder than individuals that start with low initial
   state; i.e. later BT is determined by state during an early
   `developmental window'. In contrast, when conditions are highly
   favourable (low risk, high resources) or highly unfavourable (high risk,
   low resources), individuals converge to be all relatively bold or all
   relatively cautious, respectively. In those circumstances, initial
   differences in BT are not maintained over the long term, and there is no
   early developmental window where initial state governs later BT. The
   exact range of ecological conditions favouring behavioural syndromes
   depends also on the strength of state-dependent safety.}},

   lower perceived body condition than males and their perceived body
   condition showed significant correlation with fear of brown bear, Ursus

Pages = {{65-75}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The thrifty phenotype hypothesis is widely used to interpret
   associations between early nutritional experience and degenerative
   disease risks. However, it remains unclear what is adaptive about early
   life thrift, and biomedical approaches struggle to explain why
   associations between early growth and later disease hold across the
   entire range of birth size. This issue can be addressed using a simple
   model, attributing disease to a high metabolic load (large tissue
   masses, rich diet, and sedentary lifestyle) relative to metabolic
   capacity (physiological traits contingent on fetal/infant development).
   In this context, different hypotheses regarding the long-term functions
   of thrift can be examined. The ``predictive adaptive response''
   hypothesis considers thrift to involve metabolic adaptations (insulin
   resistance and central adiposity) that emerge in anticipation of a poor
   quality adult breeding environment. The competing ``maternal capital''
   hypothesis considers thrift to involve reductions in lean mass and organ
   phenotype arising through constraints on maternal phenotype, reflecting
   both maternal developmental experience and current ecological
   conditions. This hypothesis assumes offspring developmental responses to
   stresses such as temperature, altitude, and nutritional ecology occur
   under the influence of maternal capital indices, including size,
   physiology, reproductive history and social status. I argue that insulin
   resistance only emerges after infancy, and far from being anticipatory
   of a low nutritional plane, indicates perturbations of metabolism.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel combination of feeding motivation and
   spatial preference testing. We used the feeding motivation test to
   determine a `low' barrier height that broiler chickens, Gallus gallus
   domesticus, that were not food deprived would cross to get to food, and
   a `high' barrier height that food-deprived chickens would cross to get
   to food. These barriers were then used to assess the chickens' spatial
   preferences. Birds could show their spatial preference by moving between
   two compartments with different stocking densities (14.7 birds/m(2) in a
   compartment of fixed size versus 9.3, 12.1 or 14.7 birds/m(2) in a
   compartment of adjustable size). The compartments were separated by
   either the low or the high barrier. In the density preference test, the
   number of birds in the adjustable compartment increased with increasing
   size of this compartment, indicating that birds preferred lower
   densities, an effect that became more pronounced with age. This effect
   occurred even when a barrier was used that had previously deterred
   20-25\% of birds from crossing to get to food after 6 h of food
   deprivation, suggesting that achieving a lower density was important to
   the broiler chickens. Since this methodology does not involve training,
   it could be used to evaluate the importance of spatial or other
   preferences in a wide range of domestic and nondomestic species. (c)

Abstract = {{In animals, behavioural properties such as aggressive propensity are
   often consistent over a life span, and they may form part of a
   behavioural syndrome. We studied how aggressive propensity influences
   dominance, contest behaviour and growth in the cooperatively breeding
   cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We tested whether intrinsic
   aggressive propensity (1) influences dominance in paired contests, (2)
   causes different aggression levels in contests with partners matched for
   aggressive propensity compared to unmatched partners, and how it (3)
   affects growth rate in groups that were either matched or unmatched for
   aggressive propensity. Intrinsic aggressive propensity was first scored
   with a mirror test and classified as high, medium or low. Thereafter we
   tested fish with either high or low aggressive propensity with partners
   matched for size and either matched or unmatched for aggressive type in
   a paired contest for a shelter. We scored dominance, aggression and
   submission. As predicted, (1) dominance was more clearly established in
   unmatched than in matched contests and (2) individuals with high
   aggressive propensity launched more attacks overall than fish with low
   intrinsic aggressiveness, suggesting a higher propensity to escalate
   independently of winning or losing the paired contest. However, contrary
   to expectation, (3) individuals with low aggressiveness grew faster than
   aggressive ones in unmatched groups, whereas the opposite occurred in
   matched groups. This suggests that individuals with low aggressive
   propensity may benefit from conflict evasion, which might allow them to
   gain dominance in the future owing to larger body size. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease and
   type 2 diabetes, constitute the main cause of death worldwide. Eighty
   percent of these deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries,
   especially as these countries undergo socio-economic improvement
   following reductions in the burden of infectious disease. The World
   Health Organization predicts a substantial increase in the incidence of
   NCDs over the next decade globally. NCDs are generally preventable, but
   current approaches are clearly inadequate. New initiatives are needed to
   implement such prevention, and there needs to be greater recognition
   that early-life interventions are likely to be the most efficacious.
   Devising appropriate prevention strategies necessitates an understanding
   of how the developmental environment influences risk. Progress in this
   field has been slow due to an excessive emphasis on fixed genomic
   variations (hard inheritance) as the major determinants of disease
   susceptibility. However, new evidence demonstrates the much greater
   importance of early-life developmental factors, involving epigenetic
   processes and `soft' inheritance in modulating an individual's
   vulnerability to NCD. This also offers opportunities for novel
   epigenetic biomarkers of risk or interventions targeting epigenetic
   pathways to be devised for use in early life. This may pave the way to
   much more effective, customised interventions to promote health across
   the life course. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{The eating disorders anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge
   eating disorder and allied diagnoses such as eating disorder not
   otherwise specified are common, complex psychiatric disorders with a
   significant genetic component. Aetiology is unknown, but both phenotypic
   characteristics and genetic factors appear to be shared across these
   disorders, and indeed patients often change between diagnostic
   categories. Molecular studies have attempted to define genetic risk
   factors for these disorders, including case-control and family-based
   candidate gene association studies and linkage analysis of multiply
   affected nuclear families. These have used both clinical diagnoses and
   eating disorder-related intermediate phenotypes such as
   drive-for-thinness or body dissatisfaction. Candidate gene studies have
   focussed on neurotransmitter and neurodevelopmental systems {[}e.g.
   serotonergic, opioid, cannabinoid and dopaminergic receptors, and
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)], appetite regulatory peptides
   and their receptors {[}leptin, ghrelin, agouti-related protein (AgRP),
   melanocortin receptors, neuropeptide Y], energy balance systems (e.g.
   uncoupling proteins), genes implicated in obesity (e.g. FTO) and sex
   hormone systems (e.g. oestrogen receptors), either identified on the
   basis of their function alone or as positional candidates from linkage
   analysis. Of these studies, linkage analysis implicates 1p33-36 for AN,
   1q31.3 for quantitative behavioural traits related to anorexia and 10p14
   for BN, as well as other behavioural phenotypes across both disorders.
   Candidate gene association has implicated BDNF, delta 1 opioid receptor
   (OPDR1) and AgRP. More recently, with the advent of genome-wide
   association studies (GWAS), analysis with microsatellite markers has
   implicated novel candidate loci for AN at 1q41 and 11q22, and further
   GWAS results are expected in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression is often positively correlated with other behavioural traits
   such as boldness and activity levels. Comparisons across populations can
   help to determine factors that promote the evolution of such traits. We
   quantified these behaviours by testing the responses of wild-caught
   poeciliid fish, Brachyrhaphis episcopi, to mirror image stimuli. This
   species occurs in populations that experience either high or low levels
   of predation pressure. Previous studies have shown that B. episcopi from
   low predation environments are less bold than those that occur with many
   predators. We therefore predicted that fish from high predation
   populations would be more aggressive and more active than fish from low
   predation populations. However, we found the opposite - low predation
   fish approached a mirror and a novel object more frequently than high
   predation fish suggesting that `boldness' and aggression were higher in
   low predation populations, and that population-level boldness measures
   may vary depending on context. When tested individually, low predation
   fish inspected their mirror image more frequently. Females, but not
   males, from low predation sites were also more aggressive towards their
   mirror image. Variation in female aggression may be driven by a
   trade-off between food availability and predation risk. This suggests
   that the relationship between aggression and boldness has been shaped by
   adaptation to environmental conditions, and not genetic constraints. (c)

   Four meta-analyses dealing with depression as a CVD risk factor in

   circulatory system are under discussion: (1) hyperregulation of the
   autonomic nervous system (e.g., increased mean heart rate, increased
   heart rate responses, impaired heart rate variability), (2) overshooting
   stress responses of the endocrine system with impaired feedback
   mechanisms (e.g., for cortisol release), and (3) the immune system with
   dysregulated release of acute phase proteins and proinflammatory
   cytokines, all involved in a bidirectional crosstalk with the patient's

Abstract = {{The rates and patterns of growth in weight of European and North
   American infants have changed over the last 100 years. Since the
   development and first use of growth charts for postnatal health
   surveillance a century ago, there appears to have been an increase in
   the weight of 1-year olds of about 1 kg. Taking into account the higher
   past rates of infant morbidity and mortality, and poorer quality of
   artificial feeds, this change is likely to be another expression of the
   secular increase in physical stature consequent on improved hygiene and
   nutrition. Using the new WHO (World Health Organisation) standards of
   infant weight growth, this secular change can be observed for both
   breast-fed and formula-fed babies. The slower weight growth of the
   former, both now and in the past compared with modern formula-fed
   babies, may have implications of our understanding of the risk factors
   for obesity and cardiovascular disease. The variability of infant growth
   in time and space, and the plasticity of developmental processes during
   the life course (fetal life, infancy, puberty and reproduction), means
   that the WHO infant growth standard should not alone be regarded as an
   ideal growth trajectory for all babies. European Journal of Clinical

Abstract = {{Female-biased sexual size dimorphism is common in arthropods, apparently
   driven by fecundity selection in females. Selective pressures that limit
   growth are less often considered. One factor that researchers have
   rarely considered is the possible role of energetic limits on growth.
   The orb weaving spider Nephila clavipes (Linnaeus 1767) is extremely
   sexually size dimorphic. Males are ``normal{''} sized spiders and
   females are up to ten times longer, having passed through several
   additional juvenile instars. This extreme size dimorphism presents the
   opportunity to test for intrinsic energetic costs of gigantism. Prior
   studies have shown that males successfully reach maturity on a range of
   diets, while female dietary requirements increase rapidly with
   increasing size. We here examine the effects of variation in food
   availability on juvenile female development by randomly assigning
   spiderlings from six different families (from six distinct populations)
   to quantitatively varying but qualitatively identical diets. Based upon
   field observations, we expected that dietary restrictions would have the
   greatest effect on duration of instars, particularly later instars, and
   on instar number (because longer total development would lead to
   curtailment of growth at an earlier stage), with relatively little
   effect on growth per molt. Because the diets ranged from higher than
   mean intake observed in the field to well below mean intake, we expected
   females to mature at a wide range of instars (and sizes). Our results
   support the functional relationship among food intake, instar duration,
   and fixed growth per molt (although growth per molt was less canalized
   than suggested by field observations). However, we observed no variation
   in number of instars, and we suggest that these data provide additional
   support for the importance of rare, large prey in the diets of
   web-building spiders.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Imaging studies of pain processing in primary psychiatric
   disorders are just emerging. This study explored the neural correlates
   of stress-induced analgesia in individuals with posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD). It combined functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and the traumatic script-driven imagery symptom provocation
   paradigm to examine the effects of trauma-related cues on pain
   perception in individuals with PTSD. Methods: The study included 17
   patients with PTSD and 26 healthy, trauma-exposed controls. Participants
   received warm (nonpainful) or hot (painful) thermal stimuli after
   listening to a neutral or a traumatic script while they were undergoing
   an fMRI scan at a 4.0 T field strength. Results: Between-group analyses
   revealed that after exposure to the traumatic scripts, the blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal during pain perception was greater in the
   PTSD group than the control group in the head of the caudate. In the
   PTSD group, strong positive correlations resulted between BOLD signal
   and symptom severity in a number of brain regions previously implicated
   in stress-induced analgesia, such as the thalamus and the head of the
   caudate nucleus. Trait dissociation as measured by the Dissociative
   Experiences Scale correlated negatively with the right amygdala and the
   left putamen. Limitations: This study included heterogeneous traumatic
   experiences, a different proportion of military trauma in the PTSD
   versus the control group and medicated patients with PTSD. Conclusion:
   These data indicate that in patients with PTSD trauma recall will lead
   in a state-dependent manner to greater activation in brain regions
   implicated in stress-induced analgesia. Correlational analyses lend
   support to cortical hyperinhibition of the amygdala as a function of
   dissociation.}},

   behaviours consisting of early morning ascents, reverse diel vertical
   migrations, and interrupted ascents in the evening. During the first
   autumn of the study, adult fish modified their normal DVM behaviour by
   suspending their migration in the evening, yet ascending toward the
   surface in the later part of the night to reach upper layers during

   the nocturnal ascent entirely, and in the subsequent period until the
   end of January, a fraction of the population rather performed limited
   reverse migrations, slightly shifting their vertical distribution
   upwards during the first part of the day. From January to March 2008,
   fish interrupted their evening ascent at apparently random intervals and
   returned to deeper waters, instead of completing a full ascent to the

Abstract = {{Individual variation is a ubiquitous and important factor that affects
   ecological dynamics. This study examined individual variation in the
   nest-use pattern of the jumping spider Phidippus audax. Although the
   jumping spider is a diurnal species, field observations in this study
   revealed that the majority of individuals remained in their nests during
   the day. An accompanying examination of the hunger level of the spiders
   revealed that spiders that remained in nests were more starved than
   those observed outside nests. If spiders actively forage when they are
   starved, as has been suggested by previous studies, one would expect to
   see the opposite trend (i.e., spiders that remained in nests are more
   satiated). Thus, the pattern observed in the field contradicts the known
   behavioral pattern of the spiders. An individual-based model was used to
   investigate the behavioral mechanism of the spider and the discrepancy
   found in the observations. A basic assumption of the model is that
   spiders possess distinct inactive and active phases (biphasic activity
   pattern), and transitions between the two phases are regulated by the
   hunger level of the spider. Data from a laboratory experiment were used
   to examine the assumptions of the model partially. The model was able to
   capture patterns observed in the data, suggesting that the pattern of
   transitions in biphasic activity is an important trait of the foraging
   behavior of the jumping spider.}},

Abstract = {{Replacement clutches can be crucial to the breeding success of avian
   species, although several factors may influence their outcome and the
   quality of chicks. Here we compare first and replacement clutches of
   Eagle Owls in terms of chick quality, timing of breeding, and number of
   eggs and fledglings. We hypothesize that the propensity to abandon nests
   and start a new clutch could have evolved because females are able to
   produce chicks that are as good as the ones of the first clutch. We
   found that nestlings in replacement clutches were not significantly
   different from nestlings in first clutches, in terms of immune system
   and body condition; nor were there significant differences in clutch and
   brood size. Our findings may be explained by the fact that clutches were
   laid early in the season, perhaps by high-quality parents, and that food
   resources are plentiful in the study area. In order to maximize fitness,
   individuals have to adjust optimally the investment of resources in
   different life-history traits. Thus, the re-nesting behaviour of Eagle
   Owls may be seen as a way to solve the trade-off between one trait
   (survival) favoured over another (reproduction), when one of them has a
   disproportionate effect on fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In the present article the putative role of environmental factors in
   schizophrenia is reviewed and synthesized. Accumulating evidence from
   recent studies suggests that environmental exposures may play a more
   significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than
   previously thought. This expanding knowledge base is largely a
   consequence of refinements in the methodology of epidemiologic studies,
   including birth cohort investigations, and in preclinical research that
   has been inspired by the evolving literature on animal models of
   environmental exposures. This paper is divided into four sections. In
   the first, the descriptive epidemiology of schizophrenia is reviewed.
   This includes general studies on incidence, prevalence, and differences
   in these measures by urban-rural, neighborhood, migrant, and season of
   birth status, as well as time trends. In the second section, we discuss
   the contribution of environmental risk factors acting during fetal and
   perinatal life; these include infections {[}e.g. rubella, influenza,
   Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)],
   nutritional deficiencies (e.g., famine, folic acid, iron, vitamin D),
   paternal age, fetal/neonatal hypoxic and other obstetric insults and
   complications, maternal stress and other exposures {[}e.g. lead, rhesus
   (Rh) incompatibility, maternal stress]. Other putative
   neurodevelopmental determinants, including cannabis, socioeconomic
   status, trauma, and infections during childhood and adolescence are also
   covered. In the third section, these findings are synthesized and their
   implications for prevention and uncovering biological mechanisms,
   including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, are discussed.
   Animal models, including maternal immune activation, have yielded
   evidence suggesting that these exposures cause brain and behavioral
   phenotypes that are analogous to findings observed in patients with
   schizophrenia. In the final section, future studies including new,
   larger, and more rigorous epidemiologic investigations, and research on
   translational and clinical neuroscience, gene-environment interactions,
   epigenetics, developmental trajectories and windows of vulnerability,
   are elaborated upon. These studies are aimed at confirming observed risk
   factors, identifying new environmental exposures, elucidating
   developmental mechanisms, and shedding further light on genes and
   exposures that may not be identified in the absence of these integrated
   approaches. The study of environmental factors in schizophrenia may have
   important implications for the identification of causes and prevention
   of this disorder, and offers the potential to complement, and refine,
   existing efforts on explanatory neurodevelopmental models. Published by

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{173-180}},
Abstract = {{Despite ongoing projects involving the breeding and release of equids
   into semi-wild and wild environments, insufficient information is
   available in the literature that describes strategies used by equids to
   adapt and survive in a novel environment. The aim of this study was to
   assess the ability of naive, feral Equus caballus ( horse) mares to cope
   in a novel feral horse environment and investigate possible reasons why
   some may not survive this challenge. Four mares taken from a semi-arid
   desert environment remained in good health but significantly changed
   their movement behaviour pattern when surrounded by prime grazing
   habitat in a mesic temperate grassland. Three of the four mares captured
   from the prime grazing habitat and released in the semi-arid desert
   habitat died, apparently due to stress and/or starvation, within 8 weeks
   of release. The fourth mare survived 4 months but lost considerable
   weight.
   The group of mares relocated to the semi-arid desert environment had
   difficulty adapting to relocation and did not take up the movement
   behaviour strategy of local horses, which required long distance treks
   from a central water hole to distant feeding areas at least 15 km away.
   The movement behaviour, range use and health consequences of relocating
   equids may be of interest to wildlife ecologists, animal behaviourists
   and horse welfare groups. The observations may be used to guide those
   intending on relocating managed domestic and native horses to novel
   habitats.}},

Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-54}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and urbanization not only cause extirpation of
   species, but also alter the behaviour of species in human modified
   areas. We evaluated behavioural characteristics of the black-tailed
   prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), a keystone species, in the urban
   landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we investigated the
   proportion of vigilance, foraging, and social behaviour within a system
   of urban colonies that varied in area, degree of connectivity, and time
   since isolation. Overall, rates of vigilance were lower than are
   typically reported for black-tailed prairie dogs in grassland habitats.
   Colonies that were more isolated exhibited higher levels of vigilance,
   but colonies isolated for a longer period of time exhibited reduced
   vigilance. Thus, while urban stimuli may increase alertness in the most
   isolated colonies, we suggest that black-tailed prairie dogs might
   eventually adjust to these stimuli and relax their vigilance responses.
   Because behaviour varies based on age of fragments, we provide evidence
   that black-tailed prairie dog populations are responding to urbanization
   through behavioural changes that may be adaptive. The ability to
   understand how landscape-level factors influence black-tailed prairie
   dog behaviour provides important information about the response of
   keystone species to urban settings and can aid conservation and
   management efforts in fragmented systems.}},

Abstract = {{Two 3-month longitudinal studies examined weight loss following a
   1-month behavioral intervention (FIT-DSD) focusing on increasing

   was to break the distal habits hypothesized as playing a role in
   unhealthy dietary and activity behaviors. The FIT-DSD intervention
   required participants to do something different each day and to engage
   in novel weekly activities to expand their behavioral repertoire. These
   activities were not food-or exercise-related. In Study 1, the FIT-DSD
   program was compared with a control condition where participants engaged
   in daily tasks not expected to influence behavioral flexibility. Study 2
   used an active or quasicontrol group in which half the participants were

Abstract = {{Many vertebrate species alter their reproductive behavior under
   stressful conditions. Available evidence in wild birds suggests that
   under food limitation, parents reduce overall provisioning rate while
   increasing selectivity of food distribution within brood in favor of
   senior siblings. However, how acute stressors such as predation risk
   influence the magnitude and direction of changes in parental
   provisioning is poorly understood. In this study, a small passerine
   bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), was used as a model
   species to investigate parental provisioning strategies when exposed to
   different types of predators. Parents reduced provisioning rates
   remarkably when exposed to a predator of adults, whereas no behavioral
   change was observed when nest predation was imitated. Under normal
   conditions, parents preferred senior chicks to juniors. In contrast to
   experiments with food limitation, parents allocated food equally to
   senior and junior siblings under predation risk, irrespective of the
   type of a predator. No sex-related differences in parental provisioning
   strategies were found. We conclude that parents alter several aspects of
   their behavior in response to fear stress. If danger to parents occurs
   repeatedly, temporal reductions in provisioning rates may have
   cumulative and potentially harmful consequences on offspring

Title = {{Altricial Development in Wood-Feeding Cockroaches: The Key Antecedent of
   Termite Eusociality}},
Booktitle = {{BIOLOGY OF TERMITES: A MODERN SYNTHESIS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Pages = {{69-95}},
Abstract = {{Altricial development, the production of vulnerable, dependent neonates,
   is regularly associated with high levels of parental care in both
   vertebrates and invertebrates and has evolved in at least two
   phylogenetically distant, biparental wood-feeding cockroach genera:
   Cryptocercus and Salganea. Here I make the case that altricial
   development was the first deviation from standard hemimetabolous
   development in the biparental termite ancestor, played a fundamental
   role in the origin of the termite lineage, and can account for many of
   the novel traits and functions that constitute eusociality in extant
   Isoptera. Altricial neonates of subsocial wood feeding cockroaches are
   small, fragile, incapable of feeding themselves, and costly to rear.
   However, the type of care these juveniles require does not necessarily
   have to originate from a parent; consequently other members of the
   social group have the opportunity to undertake brood care obligations.
   Altricial development therefore allows for the transition to
   alloparental care, and has a great deal of explanatory power when the
   evolution of termite eusociality is framed as a hierarchical two-stage
   process. Stage 1 alloparental care both increased reproductive output of
   adults and prolonged the development of young helpers. Combined, this
   changed the nature of the family: it was composed of a greater number of
   small, vulnerable juveniles. At the same time however, parents were
   increasingly specializing in reproduction at the expense of their
   defensive parental duties. Stage I alloparental care, then, necessitated
   Stage 2, the development of a soldier caste, but it also allowed it.
   Soldiers are a nutritionally dependent caste, so alloparental feeding
   would have to be part of the behavioral repertoire before soldiers with
   specialized defensive mandibles could appear. As eusociality progressed,
   altricial development formed the operational basis for the prolongation
   of juvenile morphology, physiology and behavior into later ontogeny,
   accounting for many aspects of termite life history neglected by current
   hypotheses. Altricial development reinforces the importance of
   biparental care and hemimetabolous development in the termite ancestor
   and is a clear indication that the social environment can significantly
   influence developmental ontogeny the lineage. The evolution of termite
   eusociality is a prime example of how evolution uses existing components
   in the origin of new systems.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence of altered antioxidant systems and signs of elevated oxidative
   stress are reported in peripheral tissue and brain of schizophrenic
   patients, including low levels of glutathione (GSH), a major thiol
   antioxidant and redox buffer. Functional and genetic data indicate that
   an impaired regulation of GSH synthesis is a vulnerability factor for
   the disease. Impaired GSH synthesis from a genetic origin combined with
   environmental risk factors generating oxidative stress (e.g.,
   malnutrition, exposure to toxins, maternal infection and diabetes,
   obstetrical complications, and psychological stress) could lead to redox
   dysregulation. This could subsequently perturb normal brain development
   and maturation with delayed functional consequences emerging in early
   adulthood. Depending on the nature and the time of occurrence of the
   environmental insults, the structural and functional delayed
   consequences could vary, giving rise to various endophenotypes. The use
   of animal models of GSH deficit represents a valuable approach to
   investigate how interactions between genetic and environmental factors
   lead to the emergence of pathologies found in the disease. Moreover,
   these models of GSH can be useful to investigate links between
   schizophrenia and comorbid somatic disorders, as dysregulation of the
   GSH system and elevated oxidative stress are also found in
   cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. This chapter reviews
   pharmacological and genetic rodent models of GSH synthesis dysregulation
   used to address some of the aforementioned issues. Up to date, these
   models revealed that GSH deficits lead to morphological, physiological,
   and behavioral alterations that are quite analogous to pathologies
   observed in patients. This includes hypofunction of NMDA receptors,
   alteration of dopamine neurotransmission, anomalies in
   parvalbumin-immunoreactive fast-spiking interneurons, and reduced
   myelination. In addition, a GSH deficit affects the brain in a
   region-specific manner, the anterior cingulate cortex and the ventral
   hippocampus being the most vulnerable regions investigated.
   Interestingly, a GSH deficit during a limited period of postnatal
   development is sufficient to have long-lasting consequences on the
   integrity of PV-IR interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex and
   impairs cognitive functions in adulthood. Finally, these animal models
   of GSH deficit display behavioral impairments that could be related to
   schizophrenia. Altogether, current data strongly support a contributing
   role of a redox dysregulation on the development of pathologies
   associated with the illness and demonstrate the usefulness of these
   models to better understand the biological mechanisms leading to
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale turbulence can alter the rate of plankton predator-prey
   encounters. Encounter models predict that prey ingestion by
   slow-swimming zooplankton is enhanced at low levels of turbulence. We
   investigated whether small-scale turbulence increases ingestion for the
   slow-swimming, suspension-feeding pluteus larvae of the white urchin
   Lytechinus pictus and the purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.
   Model predictions of the critical level of turbulence, epsilon(cr),
   above which encounters due to turbulence are greater than those due to
   behavior (swimming or suspension feeding) alone, were experimentally
   tested using short-and long-term grazing treatments. Because urchin
   larvae are smaller than the smallest eddy scales of turbulence and thus
   experience turbulence as laminar shear, larvae were exposed to flow
   conditions using a simple laminar shear flow with dissipation rates,
   epsilon, of 0, 0.1, 0.4, and 1 cm(2) s(-3). Short-term ingestion of
   beads by L. pictus larvae was unaffected by epsilon < 1 cm(2) s(-3) but
   was 30\% greater at this level, which was greater than ecr based on flow
   speeds produced in suspension feeding. Long-term flow treatments with
   algal prey had no significant effect on grazing or growth. Short-term
   ingestion of beads by S. purpuratus larvae was unaffected by epsilon <
   epsilon(cr) based on suspension feeding; the effect of long-term flow
   exposure on ingestion and growth could not be investigated because of
   high mortality, suggesting greater sensitivity to flow exposure compared
   to L. pictus. Experimental results are consistent with model predictions
   that ecr is high, and thus levels of turbulence in the ocean are not
   expected to significantly increase ingestion and reduce food limitation
   in suspension-feeding urchin larvae.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic processes which include DNA methylation, histone modification

   early-life nutrition may reflect an adaptive response of the foetus to

   disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Here, we review behavioral
   and neurobiological findings from selected animal models, based on
   presumed etiology and risk factors, for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
   and major depressive disorder. We focus on the use of appropriate
   statistical tools and newly developed Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to
   link biomarkers from animal models with the human disease. We argue that
   this approach will lead to development of only the most robust animal
   models for specific psychiatric disorders and may ultimately lead to
   better understanding of the pathophysiology and identification of novel
   biomarkers and therapeutic targets.}},

Abstract = {{The obesity epidemic is a major health concern. More than two thirds of
   Americans and more than one third of children and adolescents are
   overweight or obese. Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle are
   contributing factors of overweight and obesity. Increasing physical
   activity in overweight and obese individuals can potentially improve
   health status and lower the risk of major health problems. Based on the
   theoretical frameworks of behavioral change models, health information
   technologies, and pervasive interactive technologies, a conceptual model
   has been developed. The proposed model is an intervention method
   combining a behavior change model and a personalized Health IT system
   using an interactive accelerometer-based pervasive technology component,
   to increase physical activity potentially in an overweight and obese
   population. The accelerometer automatically synchronizes with the
   personal health record database over wireless networks; the decision
   engine utilizes the theory of planned behavior model to form a feedback;
   and; proper interactive feedback is provided directly to the users in
   the personal health record interface. A prototype was developed based on
   the conceptual model. The prototype measures and stores the number of
   steps, type of steps and caloric consumption on a daily basis with an
   interval of 20 minutes by an advanced accelerometer that can simply be
   attached to any footwear. The accelerometer synchronizes automatically
   the stored data with a central database as soon as the participant
   enters a designated wireless area. Virtual characters that are embedded
   inside a personal health record system convey the feedback to the users.
   The feedback is generated based on the theory of planned behavior
   decision model utilizing the stored daily physical activity data. The
   interface prompts knowledge-based information, presents self-monitoring
   trend lines, and shows virtual character changes over time such as
   becoming obese, to reflect the tailored feedback message. In addition,
   the interface is integrated in a popular social-networking website where
   users can review other virtual characters and generate peer pressure.
   The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of implementing
   a behavioral change intervention using pervasive health information
   technology among overweight and obese population. This research explains
   the development of the conceptual model, integration of wireless
   physical activity self-monitoring devices into personal health records,
   and the application of rich interactive media to convey messages to the
   users. The final prototype will be presented and preliminary findings
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-induced defences have been demonstrated in numerous marine
   molluscs, but never in giant clams (Bivalvia: Tridacnidae). Water-borne
   cues from the predatory crab Myomenippe hardwickii were tested for their
   ability to induce changes in the shell morphology, strength and growth
   of juvenile fluted giant clams, Tridacna squamosa. Specimens were
   maintained in effluent from tanks holding `fed crabs', `starved crabs'
   and `no crabs'. To ensure changes were due to predator cues only, food
   for the crabs was provided ex situ and measures were taken to minimise
   the prey signal. After 182 days, MANOVA identified differences in
   various shell parameters relating to shape and strength. CDA showed a
   clear change in overall morphology, with strong separation among the
   three treatments. Effluent from `fed crabs' had a greater influence than
   effluent from `starved crabs', possibly because the starved crabs were
   perceived as weaker, and thus less risk. Significantly more clams died
   in `fed crabs' treatments (25\%) and `starved crabs' treatments (30\%)
   compared to the `no crabs' control (0\%). This degree of mortality has
   not been observed in similar experiments elsewhere and represents a new
   challenge to interpret. We suggest that the cause is unlikely to be
   related to the plastic responses, but rather a result of some form of
   crab-associated contaminant. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{491-498}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits generally and cognitive traits in particular are
   relatively understudied in an evolutionary ecological context. One
   reason for this is that such traits are often difficult to characterize
   among large numbers of individuals, without the influence of diverse
   environmental effects swamping intrinsic individual differences. We
   conducted standardized assays on a natural population of great tits,
   Parus major, to quantify and characterize individual variation in
   problem-solving performance, a simple cognitive trait often linked to
   innovative foraging ability. Forty-four per cent of 570 birds solved a
   food-motivated, lever-pulling problem and this proportion was consistent
   across three seasons. Individual performance was consistent within and
   across captivity sessions, across seasons, and between two different
   problem-solving tasks (lever and string pulling). Problem-solving
   performance was not explained by differences in latency to approach the
   empty task, nor latency to feed after human disturbance. Variation was
   unrelated to body condition, while age and natal origin explained
   significant but minimal amounts of variation, the importance of which
   varied between seasons. Problem-solving performance did not covary with
   exploration behaviour of a novel environment, suggesting that individual
   differences in problem solving represent an independent source of
   behavioural variation in our population. Rather than simply reflecting
   covariance with state or with other behavioural traits, our results
   suggest that variation in problem-solving performance represents
   inherent individual differences in the propensity to forage
   innovatively. We suggest that standardized problem-solving assays may
   prove ideal for studying the evolutionary ecology of simple cognitive
   traits. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The extra-fine, soft and warm fibres used by the textile industry for

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{81}},

Pages = {{361-365}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most
   popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound
   influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird
   feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season.
   Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is
   likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We
   used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study
   behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After
   2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented
   males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed
   their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2
   weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an
   effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely
   unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food
   supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher
   dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the
   feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of
   conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn
   singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of
   predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food
   itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive
   success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair
   mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Poor self-control, lack of inhibition, and impulsivity contribute to the
   propensity of adolescents to engage in risky or dangerous behaviors.
   Brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) involved in impulse-control,
   reward-processing, and decision-making continue to develop during
   adolescence, raising the possibility that an immature brain contributes
   to dangerous behavior during adolescence. However, very few validated
   animal behavioral models are available for behavioral neuroscientists to
   explore the relationship between brain development and behavior. To that
   end, a valid model must be conducted in the relatively brief window of
   adolescence and not use manipulations that potentially compromise
   development. The present experiments used three operant arrangements to
   assess whether adolescent rats differ from adults in measures of
   learning, behavioral inhibition, and impulsivity, within the
   aforementioned time frame without substantial food restriction. In
   Experiment 1, separate squads of rats were trained to lever-press and
   then transitioned to two types of extinction. Relative to their
   baselines, adolescent rats responded more during extinction than adults,
   suggesting that they were less sensitive to the abolishment of the
   reinforcement contingency. Experiment 2 demonstrated similar age-related
   differences during exposure to a differential reinforcement of low rates
   schedule, a test of behavioral inhibition. Lastly, in Experiment 3,
   adolescent's responding decreased more slowly than adults during
   exposure to a resetting delay of reinforcement schedule, suggesting
   impaired self-control. Results from these experiments suggest that
   adolescents exhibit impaired learning, behavioral inhibition and
   self-control, and in concert with recent reports, provide researchers
   with three behavioral models to more fully explore neurobiology of
   risk-taking behavior in adolescence.}},

Volume = {{165}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{311-320}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Life-history plasticity is widespread among organisms. However, an
   important question is whether it is adaptive. Most models for plasticity
   in life-history timing predict that animals, once they have reached the
   minimal nutritional threshold under poor conditions, will accelerate
   development or time to reproduction. Adaptive delays in reproduction are
   not common, especially in short-lived species. Examples of adaptive
   reproductive delays exist in mammalian populations experiencing strong
   interspecific (e.g., predation) and intraspecific (e.g., infanticide)
   competition. But are there other environmental factors that may trigger
   an adaptive delay in reproductive timing? We show that the short-lived
   flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis will delay reproduction under
   nutrient-poor conditions, even though it has already met the minimal
   nutritional threshold for reproduction. We test whether this delay
   strategy is an adaptive response allowing the scavenger time to locate
   more resources by experimentally providing supplemental protein pulses
   (early, mid and late) throughout the reproductive delay period. Flies
   receiving additional protein produced more and larger eggs,
   demonstrating a benefit of the delay. In addition, by tracking the
   allocation of carbon from the pulses using stable isotopes, we show that
   flies receiving earlier pulses incorporated more carbon into eggs and
   somatic tissue than those given a later pulse. These results indicate
   that the reproductive delay in S. crassipalpis is consistent with
   adaptive post-threshold plasticity, a nutritionally linked reproductive
   strategy that has not been reported previously in an invertebrate
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in the tendency to accept risk have
   been demonstrated in invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals, including
   humans. These individual differences have been associated with size,
   growth rate, survival, and reproductive success. Little research,
   however, has investigated the effect of developmental environment on
   individual differences in risk-acceptance. Competing hypotheses offer
   different explanations of how variation in the quality of the
   developmental environment affects risk-acceptance in adults. The first
   hypothesis states that individuals developing in poor quality
   environments take risks because such behavior is their only means of
   obtaining adequate fitness returns. The second hypothesis states that
   individuals developing in poor environments avoid risk because their
   poor physical condition makes them especially vulnerable to injury or
   death. We measured several forms of risk-accepting behavior
   (exploration, foraging, and recovery after disturbance) in male hissing
   cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) that had developed in
   nutritional and social environments of varying quality. Individuals
   raised on poor nutrition diets exhibited lower levels of risk-acceptance
   than those raised on high nutrition diets. Risk-acceptance among
   individuals that developed on poor nutrition diets was negatively
   correlated with body size. We conclude that quality of developmental

Abstract = {{With the aim of investigating the effect of the initial state of
   pre-learning on subsequent infant learning (i.e., the initial-state
   dependency), we observed the limb movements in 3-month-old infants in
   the course of a motor learning task. The session comprised 2-mm
   pre-learning and 4-min learning periods, and the infants learned to move
   a toy using a string attached to either an arm (arm-based learning,
   Experiment 1) or a leg (leg-based learning, Experiment 2). Infants were
   assigned to low- and high-state groups in the initial-state condition
   according to the average velocity of the arm (Experiment 1) or leg
   (Experiment 2) movements during the pre-learning period. The results
   revealed that, during the learning period, infants in the low-state
   group increased the movement of their limbs, whereas those in the
   high-state group showed no significant changes in the movement of most
   of their limbs. These results suggest that infants demonstrating a low
   average velocity of movement in the initial state easily observed and
   learned the circular causality between self-produced movements and
   environmental changes. On the other hand, it seemed that infants
   demonstrating a high average velocity of movement in the initial state
   could not or did not need to increase their limb movements (the toy
   would already be shaking enough to form striking movements). (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Obesity is the single greatest risk factor for the development of Type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with the prevalence of both dramatically
   increasing in recent years. These conditions are associated with medical
   complications such as hypertension, neuropathy and cardiovascular
   disease. Recent evidence also suggests a greater risk of developing
   dementia including Alzheimer's disease. The molecular mechanisms
   governing these changes remain obscure, although epidemiological
   evidence suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity (a characteristic of
   T2DM) is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Here we
   examine the effects of diet-induced insulin resistance on cognitive
   ability in an animal model not predisposed to develop Alzheimer's
   pathology. Following 12 weeks on a high fat diet (45\% of calories as
   crude fat) male Wistar rats were overweight and insulin resistant but
   not frankly diabetic. High fat fed animals were consistently poorer in
   all aspects of an operant based delayed matching to position task, yet
   were not impaired in spatial working memory as judged by the open field
   watermaze test. The cognitive deficit of the HF fed animals was most
   apparent when the task was switched from matching to non-matching to
   position, suggestive of an inability to change contingency. Performance
   in this task was negatively correlated with whole body insulin
   sensitivity but not weight gain. In conclusion this study has shown that
   insulin resistant animals exhibit impairments in an operant measure of
   behavioural flexibility which precede the development of diabetes. (C)

   acts on fitness, not health or longevity; that our evolutionary history
   does not cause disease, but rather impacts on our risk of disease in
   particular environments; and that we are now living in novel
   environments compared to those in which we evolved. We consider these
   evolutionary principles in conjunction with population genetics and
   describe several pathways by which evolutionary processes can affect

Abstract = {{We studied developmental plasticity under food stress in three
   female-biased size dimorphic predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus
   persimilis, Neoseiulus californicus, and Amblyseius andersoni. All three
   species prey on two-spotted spider mites but differ in the degree of
   adaptation to this prey. Phytoseiulus persimilis is a specialized spider
   mite predator, N. californicus is a generalist with a preference for
   spider mites, and A. andersoni is a broad generalist. Immature predators
   were offered prey patches of varying density and their survival chances,
   dispersal tendencies, age and size at maturity measured. Amblyseius
   andersoni dispersed earlier from and had lower survival chances in low
   density prey patches than N. californicus and P. persimilis. Age at
   maturity was not affected by prey density in the generalist A.
   andersoni, whereas both the specialist P. persimilis and the generalist
   N. californicus accelerated development at low prey densities.
   Species-specific plasticity in age at maturity reflects opposite
   survival strategies when confronted with limited prey: to prematurely
   leave and search for other food (A. andersoni) or to stay and accelerate
   development (P. persimilis, N. californicus). In all species, size at
   maturity was more plastic in females than males, indicating that males
   incur higher fitness costs from deviations from optimal body size. (C)

Abstract = {{Growth rate is an ecologically important trait, affecting the energy
   acquisition from, and provisioning to, the surrounding community. One of
   many costs suggested to counteract the evolution of increased intrinsic
   growth rate is an associated reduction in tolerance to conditions of
   nutrient stress. Here we test this concept with individuals possessing
   experimentally increased intrinsic growth rates (growth hormone
   transgenic coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch) relative to wild
   genotypes. Using a series of three experiments, survival and growth of
   both genotypes were assessed on a physiological and behavioral level
   while varying food abundance, social interactions, and predation risk.
   Only in complete absence of exogenous food in newly emerged fry did the
   high intrinsic growth rate appear costly with a shorter average survival
   time compared to wild-type (Exp. 1). In experiment 2, genotypes with
   elevated intrinsic growth showed equal or higher survival and growth
   than wild-type genotypes In a third experiment, adding very limited
   amounts of food and allowing for social interactions in a simulated
   natural environment benefited transgenic individuals relative to
   wild-types, but at similar magnitudes in both the absence and presence
   of predators. Populations with transgenic individuals present did not
   crash under these competitive conditions as previously reported when
   studied in simple environments where hiding and attack escape were not
   possible. Our data suggest that transgenic fish have a greater scope for
   growth under most conditions, but are not obligated to use this
   capability. Physiological (e.g. appetite and conversion efficiency) and
   behavioral traits (e.g. competitive ability and risk-taking) found
   previously to correlate positively with intrinsic growth rate in the
   transgenic strain likely aided in their survival and growth, even under
   food limited conditions. Hence, at least in coho salmon, intrinsic
   growth rate does not appear to strongly affect survival under nutrient
   stress.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{491-502}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{P> Cross-ecosystem movements of resources, including detritus, nutrients
   and living prey, can strongly influence food web dynamics in recipient
   habitats. Variation in resource inputs is thought to be driven by
   factors external to the recipient habitat (e.g. donor habitat
   productivity and boundary conditions). However, inputs of or by `active'
   living resources may be strongly influenced by recipient habitat quality
   when organisms exhibit behavioural habitat selection when crossing
   ecosystem boundaries.
   To examine whether behavioural responses to recipient habitat quality
   alter the relative inputs of `active' living and `passive' detrital
   resources to recipient food webs, we manipulated the presence of caged
   predatory fish and measured biomass, energy and organic content of
   inputs to outdoor experimental pools of adult aquatic insects, frog
   eggs, terrestrial plant matter and terrestrial arthropods.
   Caged fish reduced the biomass, energy and organic matter donated to
   pools by tree frog eggs by similar to 70\%, but did not alter insect
   colonisation or passive allochthonous inputs of terrestrial arthropods
   and plant material. Terrestrial plant matter and adult aquatic insects
   provided the most energy and organic matter inputs to the pools
   (40-50\%), while terrestrial arthropods provided the least (7\%). Inputs
   of frog egg were relatively small but varied considerably among pools
   and over time (3\%, range = 0-20\%). Absolute and proportional amounts
   varied by input type.
   Aquatic predators can strongly affect the magnitude of active, but not
   passive, inputs and that the effect of recipient habitat quality on
   active inputs is variable. Furthermore, some active inputs (i.e. aquatic
   insect colonists) can provide similar amounts of energy and organic
   matter as passive inputs of terrestrial plant matter, which are well
   known to be important. Because inputs differ in quality and the trophic
   level they subsidise, proportional changes in input type could have
   strong effects on recipient food webs.
   Cross-ecosystem resource inputs have previously been characterised as
   donor-controlled. However, control by the recipient food web could lead
   to greater feedback between resource flow and consumer dynamics than has
   been appreciated so far.}},

Abstract = {{Current work in behavioral ecology contrasts traditional hypotheses of
   context-specific adaptation with the suggestion that behaviors are often
   coupled such that animals exhibit context-general behavioral syndromes.
   Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is
   a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high
   (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the
   product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted
   spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance.
   Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome
   of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not
   consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider
   the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in
   wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that
   reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across
   the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats
   throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging
   voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2,
   7, and 14 d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition
   alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results
   indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack,
   ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces
   wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither
   repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and
   therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We
   discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of
   predation risk and mate attraction.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},

Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{317-322}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{An extensive literature has documented differences in the way individual
   animals cope with environmental challenges and stressors. Two broad
   patterns of individual variability in behavioural and physiological
   stress responses are described as the proactive and reactive stress
   coping styles. In addition to variability in the stress response,
   contrasting coping styles may encompass a general difference in
   behavioural flexibility as opposed to routine formation in response to
   more subtle environmental changes and non-threatening novelties. In the
   present study two different manipulations, relocating food from a
   previously learned location, and introducing a novel object yielded
   contrasting responses in rainbow trout selected for high (HR) and low
   (LR) post stress plasma cortisol levels. No difference was seen in the
   rate of learning the original food location: however, proactive LR fish
   were markedly slower than reactive HR fish in altering their food
   seeking behaviour in response to relocated food. In contrast, LR fish
   largely ignored a novel object which disrupted feeding in HR fish.
   Hence, it appears that the two lines appraise environmental cues
   differently. This observation suggests that differences in
   responsiveness to environmental change are an integral component of
   heritable stress coping styles, which in this particular case, had
   opposite effects on foraging efficiency in different situations. Context
   dependent fitness effects may thus explain the persistence of stable
   divergence of this evolutionary widespread trait complex. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Genetically engineered fish are nearing commercialization for
   aquaculture. If transgenic fish escape from farms, they could encounter
   and interbreed with natural populations. Relative advantages of
   transgenic fish for fitness-related traits could drive population
   processes like gene flow, but fitness trait estimates will best inform
   risk assessments if measured under environmental conditions that are
   relevant to natural environments. Wild-type and growth-enhanced
   transgenic Japanese medakas Oryzias latipes of different genetic
   backgrounds were compared for the following fitness traits: fecundity,
   fertility, survival to sexual maturity, age at sexual maturity, and
   mating advantage. Because food availability and predation have been
   shown to alter the life histories of growth-enhanced transgenic fish, we
   measured traits under four different environments: (1) high food
   availability and no predation, (2) high food availability with simulated
   predation, (3) low food availability and no predation, and (4) low food
   availability with simulated predation. We found that regardless of
   environment, there was no clear fitness trend by genotype: transgenic
   females were more fecund than wild-type females, wild-type males
   obtained more matings than transgenic males, and offspring of transgenic
   x wild-type crosses had higher survival to sexual maturity than
   offspring of two wild-type parents, possibly due to heterosis.
   Regardless of genotype, females produced more eggs in environments with
   high food availability and matured fastest under conditions of high food
   availability and no predation. Our results imply that population-level
   processes like gene flow will be difficult to predict from measurements
   of one or two fitness traits taken on fish in a single environment.
   Therefore, gene flow risk assessments should be based on estimates of
   fitness traits that span the entire life cycle, incorporate relevant
   environmental variation, and compare the transgenic fish strain with a
   wild-type strain of relevant genetic background.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary sexual traits are expected to reflect a balance between sexual
   selection and natural selection. We test the hypothesis that plasticity
   in sexual advertisement behaviors can influence this trade-off, allowing
   showier traits than expected for a given level of predation risk.
   Specifically, we tested whether the degree of behavioral plasticity
   exhibited in response to chemical cues of a co-occurring predatory wolf
   spider corresponds to courtship rate and the degree of ornamentation in
   male wolf spiders. Both ornamented (brush-legged) males and
   non-ornamented males decreased locomotion, decreased their likelihood to
   court, and increased their time to initiate courtship in response to
   predator cues. However, brush-legged males increased their time to
   initiate courtship more than did non-ornamented males, demonstrating a
   greater response to the risk of predation for the more ornamented males.
   Similarly, within brush-legged males, individuals with the highest
   courtship rates also showed the greatest degree of plasticity in time to
   initiate courtship across predation contexts, whereas behavioral
   plasticity was independent of courtship rate for non-ornamented males.
   We found no correlation between ornament size and plasticity in response
   to predator cues within brush-legged males. Ultimately, we suggest that
   our data provide support for the hypothesis that behavioral plasticity
   in response to predator cues may alter the trade-off between predation
   risk and sexual advertisement and may be more important for males with
   higher degrees of conspicuousness in ornamentation and courtship.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptations that minimize the effects of stress are important components

   speed of juvenile mourning doves Zenaida macroura. Brood size was
   manipulated during the nestling stage (< 11 days) and feeding rates
   during the fledgling stage (13-25 days) using a full factorial design.
   Effects of nutritional stress differed between the two treatments and
   depended on the response that was measured and the age at which it was
   measured. Treatment effects on flight ability were delayed and were
   greater for the treatment during the nestling stage than during the
   fledgling stage. Immediate treatment effects were greater than delayed
   effects on weight and size. Young were able to minimize effects of
   stress on flight ability at early ages when they would be most
   vulnerable to predation. However, by 90 days birds from enlarged broods
   were slower and flight time at 90 days was negatively correlated with
   weight and size at 25 days. There was no evidence for a cost of

Abstract = {{Habitat alteration by humans may change the supply of food and cover for

   utilisation within a moose Alces alces population in central Norway. Our
   study area covers forests and open habitats, both influenced by human
   alterations (e.g. forestry and agriculture). We expected moose to select
   habitats with good forage and cover in all seasons, but to select open
   foraging habitats mainly during night-time. Moose selected good foraging
   habitats, such as young forest stands and cultivated land during night,
   whereas the utilisation of older forest stands providing cover increased
   during daytime. This circadian pattern changed throughout the year,
   seemingly related to variation in hours of daylight and provision of
   forage. Young forest stands provided higher density of preferred food
   plants compared to older stands and were highly selected from spring
   until autumn. Relative to young forest, the selection for older forest
   stands increased towards winter, likely due to provision of higher plant
   quality late in the growing season, and to reduced accumulation of
   movement-impeding snow during winter. Selection of cultivated land
   varied among seasons, being highest when crop biomass was high. We also
   found some indications of state-dependent habitat selection as
   reproducing females avoided open, food rich areas in the first months
   after their calves were born, whereas males and females without young
   selected these areas in spring and summer. Our results clearly show that
   moose exploit the variations in cover and food caused by forestry and
   agriculture. This is particularly relevant for moose in Norway as
   current changes in forestry practice lead to a reduction in young,

Abstract = {{Enrichment is widely used as tool for managing fearfulness, undesirable
   behaviors, and stress in captive animals, and for studying exploration
   and personality. Inconsistencies in previous studies of physiological
   and behavioral responses to enrichment led us to hypothesize that
   enrichment and its removal are stressful environmental changes to which
   the hormone corticosterone and fearfulness, activity, and exploration
   behaviors ought to be sensitive. We conducted two experiments with a
   captive population of wild-caught Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga
   columbiana) to assess responses to short- (10-d) and long-term (3-mo)
   enrichment, their removal, and the influence of novelty, within the same
   animal. Variation in an integrated measure of corticosterone from
   feathers, combined with video recordings of behaviors, suggests that how
   individuals perceive enrichment and its removal depends on the duration
   of exposure. Short- and long-term enrichment elicited different
   physiological responses, with the former acting as a stressor and birds
   exhibiting acclimation to the latter. Non-novel enrichment evoked the
   strongest corticosterone responses of all the treatments, suggesting
   that the second exposure to the same objects acted as a physiological
   cue, and that acclimation was overridden by negative past experience.
   Birds showed weak behavioral responses that were not related to
   corticosterone. By demonstrating that an integrated measure of
   glucocorticoid physiology varies significantly with changes to
   enrichment in the absence of agonistic interactions, our study sheds
   light on potential mechanisms driving physiological and behavioral
   responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral licks-also known as ``salados,{''} ``saladeros,{''} or
   ``collpas{''}-are specific sites in tropical and temperate ecosystems
   where a large diversity of mammals and birds come regularly to feed on
   soil. Although the reasons for vertebrate geophagy are not completely
   understood, animals are argued to obtain a variety of nutritional and
   health benefits from the ingestion of soil at mineral licks. We studied
   the temporal patterns of mineral lick use by white-bellied spider monkey
   (Ateles belzebuth) and red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) in a
   lowland rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador. Using camera and video traps
   at four different mineral licks, combined with behavioral follows of one
   group of spider monkeys, we documented rates of mineral lick visitation
   by both primate species and the relative frequency and intensity of
   mineral lick use by spider monkeys. On the basis of 1,612 days and 888
   nights of mineral lick monitoring, we found that A. belzebuth and A.
   seniculus both visit mineral licks frequently throughout the year (on
   average similar to 14\% of days for both species), and mineral lick
   visitation was influenced by short-term environmental conditions (e.g.
   sunny and dry weather). For spider monkeys, the area surrounding the
   lick was also the most frequently and most intensively used region
   within the group's home range. The fact that spider monkeys spent long
   periods at the lick area before coming to the ground to obtain soil, and
   the fact that both species visited the lick preferentially during dry
   sunny conditions (when predator detectability is presumed to be
   relatively high) and visited simultaneously more often than expected by
   chance, together suggest that licks are indeed perceived as risky areas
   by these primates. We suggest that howler and spider monkeys employ
   behavioral strategies aimed at minimizing the probability of predation
   while visiting the forest floor at risky mineral lick sites. Am. J.

Abstract = {{Phenological events of plants and animals are sensitive to climatic
   processes. Migration is a life-history event exhibited by most large
   herbivores living in seasonal environments, and is thought to occur in
   response to dynamics of forage and weather. Decisions regarding when to
   migrate, however, may be affected by differences in life-history
   characteristics of individuals. Long-term and intensive study of a
   population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Sierra Nevada,
   California, USA, allowed us to document patterns of migration during 11
   years that encompassed a wide array of environmental conditions. We used
   two new techniques to properly account for interval-censored data and
   disentangle effects of broad-scale climate, local weather patterns, and
   plant phenology on seasonal patterns of migration, while incorporating
   effects of individual life-history characteristics. Timing of autumn
   migration varied substantially among individual deer, but was associated
   with the severity of winter weather, and in particular, snow depth and
   cold temperatures. Migratory responses to winter weather, however, were
   affected by age, nutritional condition, and summer residency of
   individual females. Old females and those in good nutritional condition
   risked encountering severe weather by delaying autumn migration, and
   were thus risk-prone with respect to the potential loss of foraging
   opportunities in deep snow compared with young females and those in poor
   nutritional condition. Females that summered on the west side of the
   crest of the Sierra Nevada delayed autumn migration relative to
   east-side females, which supports the influence of the local environment
   on timing of migration. In contrast, timing of spring migration was
   unrelated to individual life-history characteristics, was nearly twice
   as synchronous as autumn migration, differed among years, was related to
   the southern oscillation index, and was influenced by absolute snow
   depth and advancing phenology of plants. Plasticity in timing of
   migration in response to climatic conditions and plant phenology may be
   an adaptive behavioral strategy, which should reduce the detrimental
   effects of trophic mismatches between resources and other life-history
   events of large herbivores. Failure to consider effects of nutrition and
   other life-history traits may cloud interpretation of phenological
   patterns of mammals and conceal relationships associated with climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Hippocampal function has been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders,
   as well as in the response to antidepressant (AD) treatment. However,
   the significance of new neurons in the therapeutic mechanism of ADs
   remains unclear. In this study, the proliferation of new neurons was
   inhibited through conditional deletion of ataxia telangeictasia-mutated
   and rad-3 related (ATR), a cell cycle checkpoint kinase, and cellular
   and behavioral outcomes following AD exposure were evaluated. ATR was
   conditionally deleted by microinjecting a Cre recombinase-expressing
   virus into the hippocampus of floxed-ATR mice. Behavioral assessment in
   multiple rodent models of affective state revealed anxiolytic-like
   behavior in the elevated zero maze, marble burying test, and
   novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test. The efficacy of chronic
   desipramine (DMI) treatment was evaluated in the NIH test, as this
   paradigm is thought to be sensitive to increases in neurogenesis by
   chronic AD exposure. Chronic exposure to DMI reduced hyponeophagia in
   the NIH test in control mice, whereas DMI had no behavioral effect in
   ATR-deleted mice. Although DMI did not alter cell proliferation in
   either group, it did produce a robust increase in dendritic spine
   density in control mice, indicative of enhanced neuronal plasticity.
   This effect of DMI on spine density was severely attenuated following
   ATR deletion. These findings demonstrate that reductions in basal
   neurogenesis produce an anxiolytic phenotype and reduce AD efficacy in
   behaviors requiring chronic exposure. Furthermore, attenuated capacity
   for synaptic remodeling may underlie these behaviors. ATR deletion may
   serve as a valuable model to study the various proposed roles of newborn
   neurons in the hippocampus. Neuropsychopharmacology (2011) 36, 960-969;

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we explore a novel preparation for the study of
   animal choice behaviour designed to capture some aspects of naturally
   occurring patch exploitation. Although one can cast the problem of patch
   exploitation as a binary choice, naturally occurring patch-leaving
   decisions are inevitably asymmetric. We asked whether captive blue jays,
   Cyanocitta cristata, treat leaving and staying in the same way. To do
   this we factorially varied the delays associated with leaving and
   staying in a food patch. In addition, we manipulated our subject's level
   of motivation (e. g. hunger) using prefeeding treatments. We found that
   hungry subjects came closest to our prediction of treating leaving and
   staying in the same way, but that less motivated subjects showed a
   pronounced and surprising bias in favour of leaving. We discuss the
   implications of results for experimental and theoretical studies and
   choice behaviour. We suggest that students of choice behaviour need to
   understand the sources of such biases because naturally occurring choice
   situations are seldom perfectly symmetrical. (C) 2010 The Association

Abstract = {{We examined how availability of brine shrimps, Artemia parthenogenetica,
   influenced temporal aspects of foraging behaviour and population
   dynamics of moulting black-necked grebes, Podiceps nigricollis, from
   late August to early December in four salt ponds in the Odiel marshes,
   southern Spain, in 2008 and 2009. The moulting grebe population was
   higher in 2009, coinciding with an increase in shrimp biomass, with a
   peak of 2,500 birds in October. Grebes increased their time spent
   foraging as the season progressed, coinciding with decreases in shrimp
   biomass and water temperature. Foraging activity was lower in 2009, when
   shrimp biomass was greater. Diving was the most frequent feeding method,
   especially as the season progressed. Brine shrimps at the bottom of the
   water column were larger than those near the surface. Differences
   between years in grebe body mass suggest that changing shrimp
   availability and water temperature had an influence on body condition.
   The grebe population consumed an estimated 0.2-2.0\% of the standing
   crop of Artemia per day, with this fraction increasing as the season
   progresses, thus contributing to the decline in the Artemia population.
   Our results suggest that moulting grebes are probably only able to
   adjust foraging effort within certain limits, especially at the end of
   moulting period when thermal stress is greatest and food supply is
   lowest. They may leave the study area when they can no longer meet their
   energy requirements.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is no surprise that it has taken over four decades to
   confirm and extend the crucial role of dopamine and related genes and
   gene deficits in the etiology of risk for drug dependence. Hundreds of
   studies, enabled by neuroscience neuroimaging and genetic advances, have
   been reported. While dopamine theories have been reported, confirmed,
   replicated and replicated again, changes have been slow to move from the
   bench to the bedside. Unlike penicillin used to target certain
   infections, addiction requires the consent, motivation and enthusiastic
   participation of the patient. Clearly, current treatment has not caught
   up with advances in the science. In-patient and out-patient treatment
   still relies on detoxification, abstinence and 12 step programs.
   Addiction is a chronic and relapsing disease. Addiction treatment can be
   reported as cures at 3 or 6 weeks, only to be clearly failures at 1 or 5
   years. The logical standard of care should focus on detoxifying,
   stabilizing and returning the patient to the pre-loss of control or
   pre-addiction neurochemical state.
   Method: Pre-clinical and clinical data on neurochemistry and
   neurogenetics of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) as it relates to both
   relapse and drug hunger has been reviewed.
   Results: We are proposing herein that efforts to physiologically
   integrate known neural mechanisms with other psychotherapeutic treatment
   options to combat relapse should be encouraged. It is well known that
   after prolonged abstinence, recovered addicts are particularly
   vulnerable to relapse. Individuals who use their drug of choice after
   abstinence experience a powerful euphoria that can quickly precipitate a
   full-blown relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum
   has remained elusive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed
   ``supersensitivity{''} might be the result of pre-morbid or state
   genetic hypodopaminergic polymorphisms.
   Hypothesis: We are proposing that recent studies have indicated that
   genetic, personality and environmental factors are predictors of drug
   use in adolescents. Exploration of various treatment approaches for the
   most part reveal poor outcomes in terms of relapse prevention and
   continued drug hunger. The authors are proposing a new paradigm shift in
   residential, non-residential and aftercare involving the incorporation
   of genetic testing to identify risk alleles coupled with D2 receptor
   stimulation using neuroadatogen amino acid precursor enkephlinase -
   catecholamine-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition therapy. A natural but
   therapeutic nutraceutical formulation potentially induces DA release
   could cause the induction of D2-directed mRNA and proliferation of D2
   receptors in the human. We further hypothesize that this proliferation
   of D2 receptors in turn will induce the attenuation of drug-like craving
   behavior. Finally, pharmacological therapies have had limited success
   because these powerful agents have focused on maintenance or
   interference with drug euphoria rather than correcting or compensating
   for pre-morbid dopamine system deficits These concepts await further
   confirmation via required neuroimaging studies. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{Plasticity in developmental programming has evolved in order to provide
   the best chances of survival and reproductive success to the organism
   under changing environments. Environmental conditions that are
   experienced in early life can profoundly influence human biology and
   long-term health. Developmental origins of health and disease and
   life-history transitions are purported to use placental, nutritional,
   and endocrine cues for setting long-term biological, mental, and
   behavioral strategies in response to local ecological and/or social
   conditions. The window of developmental plasticity extends from
   preconception to early childhood and involves epigenetic responses to
   environmental changes, which exert their effects during life-history
   phase transitions. These epigenetic responses influence development,
   cell-and tissue-specific gene expression, and sexual dimorphism, and, in
   exceptional cases, could be transmitted transgenerationally.
   Translational epigenetic research in child health is areiterative
   process that ranges from research in the basic sciences, preclinical
   research, and pediatric clinical research. Identifying the epigenetic
   consequences of fetal programming creates potential applications in
   clinical practice: the development of epigenetic biomarkers for early
   diagnosis of disease, the ability to identify susceptible individuals at
   risk for adult diseases, and the development of novel preventive and
   curative measures that are based on diet and/or novel epigenetic drugs.

   langurs (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) in a limestone habitat at Fusui
   Nature Reserve, China, between August 2007 and July 2008. During the
   study period, the total home range sizes for the 2 focal groups were
   23.8 ha and 33.8 ha, the mean daily path lengths were 491 m and 512 m,
   and leaves accounted for 83.4\% and 91.0\% of the diet, which are well
   within the range of variation reported for other Trachypithecus. One
   focal group traveled significantly longer distances in the rainy season
   months than in the dry season months. This variation may be related to
   the seasonal difference in food availability and diet. The langurs did
   not use their home ranges uniformly, and 50\% of their activities
   occurred within 11\% (group 1) and 20\% (group 2) of their home ranges.
   The most heavily used quadrats in the home ranges were located near the

Abstract = {{Immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system, is well documented in
   humans and laboratory models and is known to increase infection risk,
   morbidity, and mortality among the old. Immunosenescence patterns have
   recently been unveiled in various free-living populations, but their
   consequences in the wild have not been explored. We investigated the
   consequences of immunosenescence in free-living Tree Swallows
   Tachycineta bicolor through a field experiment simulating a bacterial
   infection (challenge with lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in females of
   different ages during the nestling rearing period. We assessed
   behavioral and physiological responses of females, as well as growth and
   quality of their offspring, to determine the costs associated with the
   simulated infection. Results of the experiment differed between the two
   years of study. In the first year, old females challenged with LPS lost
   more body mass and reduced their nest visitation rates more, and their
   offspring tended to grow slower compared to similarly challenged younger
   females. In contrast, in the second year, old females did not appear to
   suffer larger costs than younger ones. Interestingly, immunosenescence
   was only detected during the first year of the study, suggesting that it
   is the dysregulated immune function characteristic of immunosenescent
   individuals rather than age per se that can lead to higher costs of
   immune defense in old individuals. These results provide the first
   evidence of costs of immunosenescence in free-living animals and support
   the hypothesis that old, immunosenescent individuals pay higher costs
   than younger ones when faced with a challenge to their immune system.
   Our results also suggest that these costs are mediated by an exaggerated
   sickness behavior, as seen in laboratory models, and can be modulated by
   ecological factors such as weather conditions and food availability.}},

   in Three Duck Species}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Predation directly triggers behavioural decisions designed to increase
   immediate survival. However, these behavioural modifications can have
   long term costs. There is therefore a trade-off between antipredator
   behaviours and other activities. This trade-off is generally considered
   between vigilance and only one other behaviour, thus neglecting
   potential compensations. In this study, we considered the effect of an
   increase in predation risk on the diurnal time-budget of three captive
   duck species during the wintering period. We artificially increased
   predation risk by disturbing two groups of 14 mallard and teals at
   different frequencies, and one group of 14 tufted ducks with a
   radio-controlled stressor. We recorded foraging, vigilance, preening and
   sleeping durations the week before, during and after disturbance
   sessions. Disturbed groups were compared to an undisturbed control
   group. We showed that in all three species, the increase in predation
   risk resulted in a decrease in foraging and preening and led to an
   increase in sleeping. It is worth noting that contrary to common
   observations, vigilance did not increase. However, ducks are known to be
   vigilant while sleeping. This complex behavioural adjustment therefore
   seems to be optimal as it may allow ducks to reduce their predation
   risk. Our results highlight the fact that it is necessary to encompass
   the whole individual time-budget when studying behavioural modifications
   under predation risk. Finally, we propose that studies of behavioural
   time-budget changes under predation risk should be included in the more
   general framework of the starvation-predation risk trade-off.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions experienced early in life have been shown to
   significantly affect growth trajectories at later stages in many
   vertebrate species. Amphibians typically have a biphasic life history,
   with an aquatic larval phase during early development and a subsequent
   terrestrial adult phase after completed metamorphosis. Thus, the early
   conditions have an especially strong impact on the future survival and
   fitness of amphibians. We studied whether early nutritional conditions
   affect the behavioural reaction of fire salamander larvae (Salamandra
   salamandra) before completion of metamorphosis. Fire salamander larvae
   reared under rich nutritional conditions were heavier and larger,
   displayed better body condition overall throughout the first three month
   of life and metamorphosed earlier compared with larvae raised under poor
   nutritional conditions. Specifically, we tested whether larvae reared
   under these different conditions differed with respect to their
   risk-taking behaviour and activity. We found no differences in the
   activity of larvae with respect to their experienced early food
   conditions. However, larvae reared under poor nutritional conditions hid
   significantly more often in a risk-taking test than larvae reared under
   rich food conditions. This increase in shelter-seeking behaviour might
   be an adaptation to reduce the risk of larval drift or an adaptation to
   compensate for physiological deficits in part by appropriate behavioural
   reactions. Our results indicate that environmental conditions, such as
   food availability, may lead to different behavioural strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient balancing is well known in herbivores and omnivores, but has
   only recently been demonstrated in predators. To test how a predator
   might regulate nutrients when the prey varies in nutrient composition,
   we restricted juvenile Pardosa prativaga wolf spiders to diets of one of
   six fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, prey types varying in lipid:
   protein composition during their second instar. We collected all fly
   remnants to estimate food and nutrient intake over each meal. The
   spiders adjusted their capture rate and nutrient extraction in response
   to prey mass and nutrient composition irrespective of energy intake.
   Intake was initially regulated to a constant lipid plus protein mass,
   but later spiders fed on prey with high proportions of protein increased
   consumption relative to spiders fed on other prey types. This pattern
   indicates that the spiders were prepared to overconsume vast amounts of
   protein to gain more lipids and energy. The spiders also regulated
   protein after ingestion, and ingested protein was incorporated less
   efficiently into body tissue when the prey was protein rich. Despite
   both pre- and postingestive nutrient regulation, the body lipid: protein
   compositions of the spiders were highly affected by the nutrient
   compositions of their prey, and growth in carapace length and lean body
   mass increased with increasing prey protein: lipid ratio. Our results
   demonstrate that prey nutrient composition affects these predators, but
   also that the spiders possess behavioural and physiological adaptations
   that lead to partial compensation for these effects. (C) 2011 The

Title = {{Divergent trophic levels in two cryptic sibling bat species}},

Volume = {{166}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-78}},

Abstract = {{Changes in dietary preferences in animal species play a pivotal role in
   niche specialization. Here, we investigate how divergence of foraging
   behaviour affects the trophic position of animals and thereby their role
   for ecosystem processes. As a model, we used two closely related bat
   species, Myotis myotis and M. blythii oxygnathus, that are
   morphologically very similar and share the same roosts, but show clear
   behavioural divergence in habitat selection and foraging. Based on
   previous dietary studies on synanthropic populations in Central Europe,
   we hypothesised that M. myotis would mainly prey on predatory arthropods
   (i.e., secondary consumers) while M. blythii oxygnathus would eat
   herbivorous insects (i.e., primary consumers). We thus expected that the
   sibling bats would be at different trophic levels. We first conducted a
   validation experiment with captive bats in the laboratory and measured
   isotopic discrimination, i.e., the stepwise enrichment of heavy in
   relation to light isotopes between consumer and diet, in insectivorous
   bats for the first time. We then tested our trophic level hypothesis in
   the field at an ancient site of natural coexistence for the two species
   (Bulgaria, south-eastern Europe) using stable isotope analyses. As
   predicted, secondary consumer arthropods (carabid beetles; Coleoptera)
   were more enriched in N-15 than primary consumer arthropods
   (tettigoniids; Orthoptera), and accordingly wing tissue of M. myotis was
   more enriched in N-15 than tissue of M. blythii oxygnathus. According to
   a Bayesian mixing model, M. blythii oxygnathus indeed fed almost
   exclusively on primary consumers (98\%), while M. myotis ate a mix of
   secondary (50\%), but also, and to a considerable extent, primary
   consumers (50\%). Our study highlights that morphologically almost
   identical, sympatric sibling species may forage at divergent trophic
   levels, and, thus may have different effects on ecosystem processes.}},

   health-related quality of life (HRQL) and life satisfaction (LS)].
   The model explained 27.1 and 18.2\% of the variance for HRQL and LS,
   respectively. Age was positively related to HRQL (beta = 0.14, P <

Abstract = {{To increase their chances of survival and reproduction, animals must
   detect changes in food quality and then decide if, and how quickly, to
   adjust their behavior. How quickly an animal responds to change will
   depend on the information available (cognitive, sensory, or
   physiological) and how it weights those types of information. Surrogate
   measures of meal size suggest that sensory information is used to make
   initial choices about how much to eat following changes in resource
   quality, choices are subsequently altered and refined as further
   information becomes available. Using direct measures, we investigated
   the amount of food consumed, the time taken to feed, and the interbout
   intervals between visits to a feeder of rufous hummingbirds, before and
   after changes in sucrose concentration. The hummingbirds did not change
   how much they drank at first experience of a new concentration but then
   rapidly adjusted meal sizes toward optimal for that concentration over a
   few feeding visits. Thus, it seems the hummingbirds used both cognitive
   and physiological information to decide how much to drink but appeared
   to ignore sensory information, such as taste. The early responses
   animals make to changed resources enable us to determine the types of
   information on which they rely most in their decision making.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE-Fixed genomic variation explains only a small proportion of
   the risk of adiposity. In animal models, maternal diet alters offspring
   body composition, accompanied by epigenetic changes in metabolic control
   genes. Little is known about whether such processes operate in humans.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Using Sequenom MassARRAY we measured the
   methylation status of 68 CpGs 5' from five candidate genes in umbilical
   cord tissue DNA from healthy neonates. Methylation varied greatly at
   particular CpGs: for 31 CpGs with median methylation and a >= 5\% and a
   5-95\% range >= 10\%, we related methylation status to maternal
   pregnancy diet and to child's adiposity at age 9 years. Replication was
   sought in a second independent cohort.
   RESULTS-In cohort 1, retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA) chr9: 136355885+
   and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) chr7: 150315553+
   methylation had independent associations with sex-adjusted childhood fat
   mass (exponentiated regression coefficient {[}beta] 17\% per SD change

   {[}1-19], P = 0.023, n = 64 and beta =12\% {[}4-20], P = 0.002, n = 66,
   respectively). Regression analyses including sex and neonatal epigenetic
   marks explained > 25\% of the variance in childhood adiposity. Higher
   methylation of RXRA chr9: 136355885+, but not of eNOS chr7:150315553+,
   was associated with lower maternal carbohydrate intake in early
   pregnancy, previously linked with higher neonatal adiposity in this
   population. In cohort 2, cord eNOS chr7:150315553+ methylation showed no
   association with adiposity, but RXRA chr9:136355885+ methylation showed
   similar associations with fat mass and \%fat mass (beta = 6\% {[}2-10]
   and beta = 4\% {[}1-7], respectively, both P = 0.002, n = 239).
   CONCLUSIONS-Our findings suggest a substantial component of metabolic
   disease risk has a prenatal developmental basis. Perinatal epigenetic
   analysis may have utility in identifying individual vulnerability to
   later obesity and metabolic disease. Diabetes 60:1528-1534, 2011}},

   evaluate the co-existence of environmental predisposing conditions.
   Design and methods: A 60-item questionnaire was completed by a
   school-based sample (n = 1536, ages 6-18 years). Diagnostic assessment
   of primary headache and periodic syndromes was established in first
   section; predisposing conditions in the second section; while the third
   section quantified the frequency of self medication and identified drugs
   most frequently used.
   Results: Headache was reported by 62.1\% of subjects. Socioeconomic
   status, composition of family unit and nutrition habits in the first
   year of life did not appear significantly different in subjects with
   headache compared to healthy controls. A good sleep quality was found in
   95.2\% of healthy controls, in 89.4\% of children with occasional
   headache. Recurrent abdominal pain, motor weakness and car sickness was
   significantly higher in primary headache group compared to occasional
   headache. Depressive/anxious traits were significantly higher in primary
   headache and occasional headache groups than in healthy controls. The
   frequency of aggressive traits was also higher in children with primary
   headache compared to occasional headache and healthy control subjects.
   72.5\% of subjects with primary headache and 58.4\% of children with
   occasional headache assumed medicines to relieve pain. Paracetamol was
   the most frequently assumed drug.

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to present a review about the concept of
   resilience, its biological aspects, the way we can try to measure it and
   some possible interventions.
   In Spanish, the term resiliencia is taken from the English word
   resilience or resiliency, term originally used in thermodynamics. In
   biological sciences, resilience is defined as ``the capability of an
   ecosystem or organism to recover its steadiness after it has suffered an
   alteration{''}. In psychosocial research, Rutter defines resilience as
   ``the relative resistance to the psychosocial experiences of risk{''}.
   For the resilience process to take place, it is necessary that
   individuals become exposed to an important stress and adversity load,
   and their efforts to contend them result in a positive adaptation in
   spite of suffering aggressions throughout the developmental process.
   When facing significant stress, three potential responses can be
   anticipated: 1. That individuals at risk show a better evolution than
   expected; 2. That a positive adaptation remains in spite of stressing
   experiences; or 3. That individuals reach an acceptable recovery after a
   trauma.
   The physiological response to the acute stress involves several
   neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones, which have functional
   interactions that may produce a psychobiological response in the face of
   the acute stress and long term psychiatric consequences because they
   mediate mechanisms and neuronal paths that regulate reward, fear
   conditioning and social behavior. Cortisol, corticotropin-releasing
   hormone, norepinephrine, galanin, neuropeptide Y, dopamine and serotonin
   are some of the substances (physiological {[}or stress] mediators)
   implicated.
   After important stress exposure, we can say that a person has a
   resilient profile if his/her dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), neuropeptide
   Y, galanin, testosterone, 1A serotonin receptor (5HT1A) and
   benzodiazepine receptor levels are increased at the time that the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the locus coeruleus
   system functions are diminished.
   The biological factors associated with the acute and chronic stress can
   be considered a measure of resilience. For this purpose, the term
   allostasis, defined as the adaptive physiological response against the
   acute stress, has been proposed. Ideally, once the acute stress is
   suppressed, the individual is capable of recovering the state of
   homeostasis. However, if this does not occur and adaptive response
   against the acute stress persists or decreases only partially, it
   results in a harmful cumulative effect on the physiological and
   psychological functions of the individual. This phenomenon is
   denominated ``allostatic load{''}.
   To evaluate the allostatic load it is necessary to incorporate
   information on the usual levels of each individual's allostasis, and to
   evaluate the dynamics of the systems and the parameters of the main
   regulation systems.
   The parameters to evaluate the allostatic load are: a) Arterial systolic
   pressure >148 mmHg and arterial diastolic pressure >83 mmHg, which are
   the cardiovascular activity index; le) Waist-hip index > 0.94, that
   reflects the chronic metabolism function and the disposition of body
   fat; c) The total cholesterol/high density lipids (HDL)relation in serum
   >5.9, related with the development of atherosclerosis; d) Glycosylated
   hemoglobin levels >7.1\%, to identify the average of plasma glucose
   concentration over prolonged periods of time; e) Dehydroepiandrosterone
   sulfate (DHEA-S) <350 ng/ml, a functional antagonist of the HPAA; f)
   Nocturnal urinary cortisol excretion ratio >25.7 ug/g creatinine, which
   measures the 12 hours HPAA activity; g) Nocturnal urinary adrenaline >48
   ug/g creatinine, and noradrenaline excretion >5 ug/g creatinine; this
   test integrates the 12-hours indexes of the sympathetic nervous system
   activity.
   The appropriate study of resilience requires consideration to other
   aspects influencing its nature besides the biological ones. Some of them
   are: a) The risk factors, defined as events or conditions of adversity
   associated with the presence of psychopathology or dysfunctional
   development; b) The vulnerability factors, that is, the features,
   genetic biases and environmental or biological deficiencies which
   increase the stress and risk factors response; and c) The protective
   factors, described as features, contextual characteristics and
   interventions that promote the resistance, or moderate the effects, to
   the risk factors. The protective factors are associated with health and
   functional development; therefore, they promote resilience and offer new
   options to cope with the event.
   These factors are studied in three areas: those characteristic of
   children, in the family atmosphere and in the community.
   The characteristic factors of children are: intelligence, temperament,
   flexibility, sense of humor and self-esteem. Related to these a number
   of annotations have been made. For instance, in certain individual
   intelligence is modified due to a sequence of stress exposure, like
   family violence. Individuals with a resistant personality experience
   more trust and are better prepared to apply their abilities and take
   advantage of their social support; likewise, cooperativeness, kindliness
   and tolerance are characteristics that could help the child to deal with
   the presence of harsh conditions; and finally, people with a high
   opinion of themselves seem to be more resistant to stressing events.
   The factors of the family atmosphere are: maltreatment, parental loss,
   attachment and support, discipline and surveillance, carefulness and
   parents' mental illness. Regarding these factors it is possible to say
   that abuse can result in a disturbance of the normal development.
   Whereas a good care quality educational opportunities, appropriate
   nutrition and support from the community to the families, during the
   early childhood, propitiate a positive development at a cognitive,
   social and self-regulation level in both children and adolescents. It is
   known that resilient boys come from homes with structure and rules. For
   these children, the role of a healthy and reliable paternal figure
   serves as a model for identity and for the appropriate emotional
   expression. Instead, the resilient girls develop in homes that combine
   the emphasis in the taking of risks as well as the independence, besides
   they are supported by a caregiver.
   Finally, the factors in the community are: violence, social networks and
   neighborhood. It has been recognized that children who live in violent
   neighborhoods have a high risk of developing internalized and
   externalized disorders. Nevertheless, the acceptance of their peers and
   their friendships can attenuate their family adversity, what surely
   helps them to acquire social abilities; in that same direction, an
   appropriate social organization can reduce the impact of poverty and
   violence in the community.
   It is important to mention that these factors continually interact with
   each other (and should not be seen in an isolated way) in what we call
   adaptive systems, those which directly contribute to the satisfactory
   adjustment or recovery of balance after the exposure to one or more
   adverse events. When these adaptive systems are available and work
   properly, the individuals are said to be resilient. We know that in
   these adaptive systems, mainly in the first stages of life, a
   disturbance can exist as a consequence of chronic or acute exposure of
   the individual to adversity. The adaptive systems are as follows:
   learning, attachment, motivation, response to stress, self-modulation,
   family, school, pairs, cultural and social systems.
   In the study of resilience, it is impossible to solely have a biological
   or environmental vision. A gene-environment interplay perspective allows
   a more integrative model of this and other phenomena. There exist at
   least two types of gene-environment interplay: 1. The gene-environment
   correlation (r(GE)) and 2. The gene X environment interaction.
   Studies in maltreated children have been carried out, where genes
   implicated in the protection or decrease of risk to psychopathology have
   been identified. Certain genotypes confer protection for depression,
   schizophrenia, abuse of substances or maltreatment.
   To know some of the factors that may contribute to resilience leads us
   to the following question: will it be possible to intervene in
   populations at risk?
   From this perspective, the fact that children suffer damage as a
   consequence of the insult to their adaptive systems which are not
   completely developed, makes it possible to prevent the damage, and to
   repair or to improve these adaptive systems.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary trends in obesity mean that research into whether
   unbalanced diets could impact on behavioural traits became increasingly
   important. The timing of exposure to obesity is particularly important,
   as sensitive periods during development have been identified where
   dietary extremes play a critical role in determining adult risk of
   physiological dysfunction. To this end, female Wistar rats were fed on
   chow or cafeteria diet (CD) for 8 weeks from weaning until mating. Half
   of the mated animals within each group were crossed-over to the
   alternative diet. This generated four treatment groups, differing in
   their pre-gestational and gestational diets. After birth, offspring of
   dams from each of the 4 pregnancy groups were further divided into
   groups, either being fed chow or CD throughout lactation.
   Anxiety-related behaviour and exploration in the offspring were tested
   in the Elevated Plus Maze (EMP) and the Open Field (OF) at 10 weeks of
   age. Maternal obesity significantly reduced the EPM locomotor activity
   in male and female offspring and grooming in males. Lactational CD had
   an anxiolytic effect in male offspring as shown in the EPM (increased
   entries into and more time on open arms) and the OF (shorter latency to
   enter the centre). In both sexes, lactational CD reduced grooming upon
   exposure to the EPM and the OF. Post mortem analysis revealed a
   stimulant effect of lactational CD on adipose tissue growth. The present
   study demonstrates that pre-gestational, gestational and lactational
   maternal CD programme behaviour in the offspring with lactational CD

Title = {{Space Use of Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) Revealed by Radio-Tracking}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Accurate estimates of movement behavior and distances
   travelled by animals are difficult to obtain, especially for
   small-bodied insects where transmitter weights have prevented the use of
   radio-tracking.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use
   of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of
   bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central
   European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of
   2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus
   ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively.
   Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a
   few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape
   scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than
   expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of
   this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e. g.
   trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also
   observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B.
   hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and
   without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight
   of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on
   the insects.
   Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can
   now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances
   exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest
   that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However,
   even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to
   compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting
   behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could
   open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect
   pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and
   requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e. g. when
   searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.}},

Volume = {{668}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In view of its fundamental and pervasive influences and impacts on
   organism physiology and ecology, body size is recognized as a key
   component of evolutionary fitness and serves as the cornerstone of a
   seminal contribution in freshwater zooplankton ecology-the Size
   Efficiency Hypothesis (SEH) of Brooks \& Dodson (Science 150:28-35,
   1965). While the roles and implications of body size in predation and
   competition-central tenets of the SEH-have been widely considered and
   reviewed, no broader integrated synthesis exists of the collective array
   of body size determinants and their implications in the ecology in
   crustacean zooplankton-a numerically and functionally dominant group of
   aquatic organisms. Focusing on planktonic Cladocera and Copepoda in
   inland waters, in particular, we provide a wide-ranging overview of the
   direct and/or indirect effects of environmental conditions, consumable
   resources and biotic interactions that independently and/or collectively
   influence the phenotypic expression of body size (particularly as
   length), both within and between species. Some indirect ultimate
   evolutionary consequences of body size are considered, and we identify
   some controversies and unresolved issues related to this biologically
   crucial trait. While by no means exhaustive, our overview reveals a
   complex nexus of extrinsic proximate abiotic and biotic factors and
   interactions that influence body size, the phenotypic expression of
   which in natural systems commonly reflects contrasting outcomes related
   to conflicting direct and/or indirect selective pressures. In general,
   however, body size (both inter- and intra specifically) declines with
   rising temperature and increases with rising food supply (depending on
   its quality), although both temperature and food supply exert contrary
   influences on particular taxa (or life history stages) under certain
   environmental circumstances. Predation undoubtedly has an overriding
   influence on body size selection. Depending on its mechanistic basis
   (visual, tactile or both in tandem), it selectively favours either small
   or large body size, both within (adults vs. juveniles) and between prey
   species, which are accordingly often `size-trapped' between contrasting
   selective pressures, with consequent indirect effects. The bioenergetics
   of fundamental physiological processes undoubtedly set constraints on
   body size and serve as the primary determinant. However, within such
   constraints, the phenotypic expression of body size reflects its
   adaptive modification in response to the prevailing abiotic and biotic
   environment. As such, body size represents an emergent ecological
   property, reflecting the outcome of specific circumstances and
   conditions, which vary both temporally within and spatially between
   different ecosystems, and are accordingly context dependent.
   Nevertheless, underlying physiological advantages of larger size (within
   and between species) among crustacean zooplankters-lower mass-specific
   metabolic rates (although recently challenged), higher individual
   feeding rates (at least among cladocerans), potentially wider food
   size-ranges, better starvation tolerances, higher potential fecundity,
   etc.-collectively favour the selection of increased body size, as
   predicted by the SEH. Although competitive superiority of large size
   (measured in terms of minimal food requirements) has been confirmed
   experimentally, this cannot be generalized to natural conditions, where
   conflicting and temporally variable pressures apply, and contribute to
   generally mixed, and temporally variable body size compositions.
   Complex undrlying ecological interactions and influences ultimately
   determine the phenotypic expression of body size in directions
   consistent with fitness optimization under prevailing circumstances.
   Certain specific and general deficiencies in information are identified.
   In particular, the overwhelming emphasis on daphniid cladocerans as
   model study taxa in freshwater ecosystems has marginalized the
   acquisition of a comparably broad and penetrating understanding of
   specific features both of non-daphniid cladoceran and copepod life
   histories and body size selection. Among daphniid cladocerans,
   contemporary definitive understanding devolves largely from reductionist
   laboratory approaches. Holistic re-integration of these mechanistic
   findings into natural system circumstances presents a difficult
   challenge that is attracting increasingly attention. With regard to
   copepods, synthetic integration of the expansive marine knowledge base
   appears crucial to inform and direct future investigations on freshwater
   taxa. The question of intrinsic body size regulation in copepods and
   cladocerans, especially in regard to final phenotypic plasticity in body
   size expression, awaits resolution. Overall, body size remains a
   multi-facetted and complex topic, offering promising challenges for
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Early-onset drug taking is associated with increased likelihood of
   addiction, but it is unclear whether early onset is causal in
   development of addiction. Many other factors are associated with
   increased risk of addiction and also promote early intake. Here, a
   rodent model is used to explore the causality of early onset in
   development of self-administration and addiction-like behavior and to
   examine factors that promote self-administration.
   We used cocaine self-administration to examine drug taking and
   addiction-like behavior in adolescent and adult rats a priori
   characterized for their locomotor responses to novelty and cocaine and
   behavior in the light-dark task.
   Adolescent animals initially sought more cocaine than adults. However,
   as the adolescents matured, their intake fell and they did not differ
   from adults in terms of unreinforced lever-pressing, extinction or
   reinstatement behavior. For both age groups, self-administration was
   positively correlated with the locomotor response to novelty, the
   locomotor response to cocaine, and with time in light in the light-dark
   task. The rats that were insensitive to cocaine's locomotor effects and
   that spent the least time in light in the light-dark task sought the
   least cocaine, appearing to be ``protected{''} from the reinforcing
   effects of cocaine. There was no difference between the two age groups
   in appearance of this ``protected{''} phenotype.
   These results suggest that early onset of drug taking may promote
   increased use, but does not promote progression to addiction-like
   behavior. Furthermore, protective factors, such as innate anxiety and
   insensitivity to cocaine's pharmacological effects, function across
   developmental stages.}},

Abstract = {{The thrifty genotype hypothesis initiated speculation that feast and
   famine cycling throughout history may have led to group-specific
   alterations of the human genome, thereby augmenting the capacity for
   excessive fat mass accrual when immersed in the modern-day obesogenic
   environment. Contemporary work, however, suggests alternative mechanisms
   influencing fuel utilization and subsequent tissue partitioning to be
   more relevant in the etiology of population-based variation in adipose
   storage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent and
   interactive contribution of ancestral admixture as a proxy for
   population-based genetic variation and diet on adipose tissue deposition
   and distribution in peripubertal children and to identify differences in
   racial/ethnic and sex groups. Two-hundred seventy-eight children (53\%

   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; energy expenditure by indirect
   calorimetry and accelerometry; and diet by 24-h-recall. Admixture
   independently contributed to all adiposity parameters; i.e., estimates
   of European and Amerindian ancestries were positively associated with
   all adiposity parameters, whereas African genetic admixture was
   inversely associated with adiposity. In boys, energy intake was
   associated with adiposity, irrespective of macronutrient profile,
   whereas in girls, the relationship was mediated by carbohydrate. We also
   observed moderating effects of energy balance/fuel utilization of the

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors associated
   with 3 presentations of hock lesions (hair loss, ulceration, and
   swelling) in freestall-housed lactating cattle. By independent
   identification and scoring of, and analysis of the factors associated
   with, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, the aim was to identify
   whether risk factors were common to all 3, or differed among the
   presentations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 76 herds in the
   UK during the winter housing period of 2007 to 2008, with a total of
   3,691 cows examined for hock lesions. A randomly selected sample of
   approximately 50 cows in each herd were scored for body condition,
   lameness, cleanliness, rising behavior, and lesions at the hocks. For
   all cows, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling were scored separately on
   4-point scales, with both left and right hocks scored. Based on a review
   of the literature, potential risk factors were identified and measured,
   collected from milk-recording data, or obtained through interviews with
   the farmers. Risk factors associated with hocks lesions in cattle were
   examined using data from the 2,982 cows housed in the 63
   freestall-housed herds visited. Risk factors for each of the 3 lesion
   presentations were considered separately in multilevel logistic
   regression models, with moderate or severe hair loss, any degree of
   ulceration, and moderate or severe swelling as the outcome variables.
   Thirty risk factors were identified, none of which were common to all 3
   lesion presentations. Five risk factors (locomotion score, number of
   days of winter housing, mean milk yield, freestall base material, and
   herd size) were common to both hair loss and ulceration. The stall
   bedding material was a common risk factor for both hair loss and
   swelling. A further 8, 5, and 11 risk factors were unique to hair loss,
   ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The existence of several
   differential risk factors between the 2 lesion presentations suggests
   that ulceration may not always be a direct extension of hair loss, as
   has been implied in previous scoring systems. Of the 12 risk factors
   associated with swelling, only 1 was common to another lesion
   presentation, which suggests that swelling may have a different etiology
   than hair loss and ulceration. The variables associated with the lesions
   indicate the importance of factors that affect the lying and rising
   behavior of the animal, including freestall structure and design, and
   the lying surface.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of many freshwater organisms correlate with a gradient
   in canopy cover, ranging from sunny wetlands to closed woodland ponds.
   Little is known about mechanisms that exclude species from some sections
   of the gradient while allowing persistence in others. I addressed this
   question by manipulating shading in 740-l outdoor mesocosms and
   measuring several ecologically-relevant traits in three species of
   amphibian larva (Rana temporaria and Triturus alpestris, generalists
   occupying the entire gradient; and Hyla arborea, a specialist in open
   habitats). Shading caused delayed development, but had no effect on
   survival and increased the growth rate of R. temporaria. Body and tail
   color were darker in the shade. Plasticity in morphological shape,
   consisting of reduced gut width and increased tail size under shaded
   conditions, may reflect poor food availability and low dissolved oxygen.
   The canopy generalist R. temporaria increased activity in the shade,
   spent more time basking in shallow water, and maintained high larval
   performance. Unexpectedly, the specialist H. arborea was also highly
   plastic. These results describe extensive phenotypic plasticity induced
   by shade, and highlight traits that may influence performance along the

Abstract = {{Sick animals may change their feeding behaviour to compensate for

   infection affects (1) feeding behaviour of predators, (2) feeding
   behaviour using an experimental approach in the wild, (3) other costly
   behaviours and/or (4) physiological components of condition. We
   experimentally infected males of the predatory damselfly Hetaerina
   americana in a field experiment. We hypothesized that infection would
   reduce feeding behaviour. We further predicted a reduction in
   territorial activity, an increase in immune response (measured by the
   activity of phenoloxidase, PO) and a reduction of fat reserves and
   flight-associated muscle mass (two traits usually traded off with immune
   ability and territorial behaviour). We also infected males in a
   laboratory experiment that controlled for food supply and territorial
   activity, and measured the same physiological characters. Immune
   challenges in the field experiment unexpectedly increased feeding rate
   but did not change territorial activities. Muscle mass was reduced in
   the field but not in the laboratory, probably because of differences in
   the presence of energetically expensive territorial activities. In the
   laboratory, starvation and infection reduced PO activity and fat stores
   but did not affect muscle mass. Thus, our field and laboratory results
   support the idea that increased feeding compensates for infections in

Abstract = {{Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional
   stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory
   growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the
   level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet,
   compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in
   life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we
   tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory
   behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their
   exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2
   consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated
   with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural
   consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect
   exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory
   growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies
   from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on
   whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in
   elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with

Abstract = {{Causes of interspecific variation in growth rates within and among

   an intriguing case because differing theories yield the possibility of
   an antagonistic interaction between nest predation risk and food
   delivery rates on evolution of growth rates. We test this possibility
   among 64 Passerine species studied on three continents, including
   tropical and north and south temperate latitudes. Growth rates increased
   strongly with nestling predation rates within, but not between, sites.
   The importance of nest predation was further emphasized by revealing
   hidden allometric scaling effects. Nestling predation risk also was
   associated with reduced total feeding rates and per-nestling feeding
   rates within each site. Consequently, faster growth rates were
   associated with decreased per-nestling food delivery rates across
   species, both within and among regions. These relationships suggest that
   Passerines can evolve growth strategies in response to predation risk
   whereby food resources are not the primary limit on growth rate
   differences among species. In contrast, reaction norms of growth rate
   relative to brood size suggest that food may limit growth rates within

Abstract = {{Individual variation in the way animals cope with stressors has been
   documented in a number of animal groups. In general, two distinct sets
   of behavioural and physiological responses to stress have been
   described: the proactive and the reactive coping styles. Some
   characteristics of stress coping style seem to be coupled to the time to
   emerge of fry from spawning redds in natural populations of salmonid
   fishes. In the present study, behavioural and physiological traits of
   stress coping styles were compared two and five months after emergence
   in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), using individuals with an early
   or late time to emerge. Initially, compared to late emerging
   individuals, early emerging individuals showed a shorter time to resume
   feeding after transfer to rearing in isolation. Resumption of feeding
   after isolation was suggested to be related to boldness behaviour,
   rather than hunger, in the present study. This observation was repeated
   five months after emergence, demonstrating behavioural consistency over
   time in this trait. However, in other traits of proactive and reactive
   stress coping styles, such as social status, resting metabolism or post
   stress cortisol concentrations, early and late emerging individuals did
   not differ. Therefore, this study demonstrates that boldness in a novel
   environment is uncoupled from other traits of the proactive and reactive
   stress coping styles in farmed salmonids. It is possible that this
   decoupling is caused by the low competitive environment in which fish
   were reared. In natural populations of salmonids, however, the higher
   selection pressure at emergence could select for early emerging
   individuals with a proactive coping style. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that dysfunctions in the serotonin system
   and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) are associated strongly
   with suicidal behavior and suicide, especially among individuals with
   major depressive disorder. Suicidal behavior has been explained using
   both the stress-diathesis model and the state-trait interaction model.
   Specifically, diatheses, or trait-dependent risk factors, are associated
   with dysfunctions in the serotonin system; however, stress responses, or
   state-dependent factors, are associated with HPA hyperactivity.
   Decreases in cholesterol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   levels have been associated with impaired brain plasticity among
   individuals with suicidal behavior. Decreased serotonin functioning has
   been measured using cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 5-HIAA, fenfluramine
   challenge studies, and platelet 5-HT2A receptors. HPA axis dysfunction
   has been evaluated with the dexamethasone suppression test Cholesterol
   and BDNF levels have been measured in blood serum or plasma.
   Nevertheless, challenges to finding promising and accessible
   neurobiological predictors of suicide and suicidal behavior remain. As
   suicide behavior is a complex phenomenon, a combined or multidimensional
   approach, including each of the aforementioned methods, may be required
   to predict suicide risk among individuals with major depressive
   disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a behavioral ecologist's view on adaptive responses
   to early stress. I first summarize two approaches to this topic drawn
   from other papers in this Special Issue: the `inoculation model' and the
   `adaptive calibration model'. I then describe three relevant modeling
   approaches from behavioral and evolutionary ecology: models of adaptive
   plasticity, models of adaptive prey behavior under uncertainty about
   risk, and models of state-dependent adaptive behavioral syndromes. These
   models generate some novel predictions on factors that explain variation
   in how organisms might respond adaptively to early stress. In
   particular, the state-dependent models of adaptive behavioral syndromes
   emphasize the importance of feedback loops between behavior and state
   variables in explaining the long-term persistence of effects of early
   experiences. State variables can include aspects of physiology,
   morphology or life history, differences among individuals in information
   state or skill, or even in social state (e.g., social rank). The
   feedbacks between behavior and individual state suggest a framework for
   an integrative approach to understanding responses to stress. The
   behavioral syndrome approach also emphasizes the importance of
   understanding stress carryovers - e.g., situations where effects of one
   kind of stressor (e.g., early social stress) carry over to influence
   other stress responses (e.g., response to danger) later in life.
   Finally, I discuss how responses to early stress might relate to
   variation in the ability of animals to cope well with novel conditions
   associated with human-induced rapid environmental change, a ubiquitous
   problem that animals face in the modern world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Objective. This study investigated whether infants' temperament at 18
   months is associated with the feeding of foods and drinks that may
   increase the risk for later obesity. Methods. This was a cross-sectional
   study of mothers and infants (N = 40 266) participating in the Norwegian
   Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of
   Public Health. Data were collected by questionnaire. Predictor variables
   were: infants' temperament at 18 months (internalizing, externalizing,
   and surgency/extraversion), and mothers' negative affectivity. Outcome
   variables were feeding of sweet foods, sweet drinks, and night-time
   caloric drinks at 18 months (all dichotomized). Confounders were child's
   gender, weight-for-height at 1 year, breastfeeding, and mother's level
   of education. Results. After controlling for confounders, infant
   temperament dimensions at 18 months were significantly associated with
   mothers' feeding of potentially obesogenic foods and drinks independent
   of mothers' negative affectivity. Infants who were more internalizing
   were more likely to be given sweet foods (OR 1.47, CI 1.32-1.65), sweet
   drinks (OR 1.76, CI 1.56-1.98), and drinks at night (OR 2.91, CI
   2.54-3.33); infants who were more externalizing were more likely to be
   given sweet food (OR 1.53, CI 1.40-1.67) and sweet drinks (OR 1.22, CI
   1.11-1.34); and infants who were more surgent were more likely to be

   association between infant temperament and maternal feeding patterns
   suggests early mechanisms for later obesity that should be investigated

Abstract = {{The imprinted brain theory proposes that autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   represents a paternal bias in the expression of imprinted genes. This is
   reflected in a preference for mechanistic cognition and in the
   corresponding mentalistic deficits symptomatic of ASD. Psychotic
   spectrum disorder (PSD) would correspondingly result from an imbalance
   in favor of maternal and/or X-chromosome gene expression. If differences
   in gene expression were reflected locally in the human brain as mouse
   models and other evidence suggests they are, ASD would represent not so
   much an `extreme male brain' as an extreme paternal one, with PSD
   correspondingly representing an extreme maternal brain. To the extent
   that copy number variation resembles imprinting and aneuploidy in
   nullifying or multiplying the expression of particular genes, it has
   been found to conform to the diametric model of mental illness peculiar
   to the imprinted brain theory. The fact that nongenetic factors such as
   nutrition in pregnancy can mimic and/or interact with imprinted gene
   expression suggests that the theory might even be able to explain the
   notable effect of maternal starvation on the risk of PSD - not to
   mention the `autism epidemic' of modern affluent societies. Finally, the
   theory suggests that normality represents balanced cognition, and that
   genius is an extraordinary extension of cognitive configuration in both
   mentalistic and mechanistic directions. Were it to be proven correct,
   the imprinted brain theory would represent one of the biggest single
   advances in our understanding of the mind and of mental illness that has
   ever taken place, and would revolutionize psychiatric diagnosis,
   prevention and treatment - not to mention our understanding of

Abstract = {{Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a method for
   increasing both the length and quality of life for over 500 years.
   Experimental work confirming the success of this approach in animals has
   accumulated over the last 100 years. Lifelong caloric restriction (CR)
   may extend life by up to 50\% in rodents, with progressively less impact
   the later in life it is started. This effect is matched by profound
   impacts on age related diseases including reduced risk of cancer,
   neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease
   and type II diabetes mellitus. The disposable soma theory of ageing
   suggests that CR evolved as a somatic protection response to enable
   animals to survive periods of food shortage. The shutdown of
   reproductive function during CR is consistent with this suggestion, but
   other features of the phenomenon are less consistent with this theory,
   and some have suggested that in rodents it may be mostly an artifact of
   domestication. CR induces profound effects on animals at all levels from
   the transcriptome to whole animal physiology and behavior. Animals under
   CR lose weight which is disproportionately contributed to by white
   adipose tissue. Generally animals on CR change their activity patterns
   so that they are more active prior to food delivery each day but total
   activity may be unchanged or reduced. Considerable debate has occurred
   over the effects of CR on resting metabolic rate (RMR). Total RMR
   declines, but as body mass and body composition also change it is
   unclear whether metabolism at the tissue level also declines, is
   unchanged or even increases. Body temperature universally decreases.
   Hunger is increased and does not seem to abate even with very long term
   restriction. Circulating adipokines are reduced reflecting the reduction
   in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass under restriction and there is a
   large reduction in circulating insulin and glucose levels. There are
   profound tissue level changes in metabolism with a generalized shift
   from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Four pathways have been implicated
   in mediating the CR effect. These are the insulin like growth factor
   (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin pathway, the adenosine
   monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the
   target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. These different pathways may interact
   and may all play important roles mediating different aspects of the
   response. Exactly how they generate the health benefits remains open for
   debate, however CR results in reduced oxidative stress and enhanced
   autophagy, both of which could be essential components of the beneficial
   effects. Most data about the effects of CR in mammals comes from work on
   rodents. There is limited work on non-human primates that shows
   promising effects and one randomized controlled trial in humans where
   physiological markers of the CR response are consistent with the
   responses in mice and rats. There are also populations of humans
   voluntarily restricting themselves. Humans on long term restriction
   report similar negative side effects to those observed in animals -
   perpetual hunger, reduced body temperature leading to a feeling of being
   cold, and diminished libido. Considerable effort has been directed in
   recent years to find drugs that mimic the CR response. Promising
   candidates are those that intersect with the critical signaling pathways
   identified above and include biguanides such as metformin that target
   the insulin signaling pathway, stilbenes (e.g.
   resveratrol) that affect sirtuin activity and drugs such as rapamycin
   that interat with mTOR signaling. Whether it will ever be possible to
   find drugs that capture the health benefits of CR without the negative
   side-effects remains unclear. Moreover, even if such drugs are developed
   how the current licensing system for drug use in western societies would
   cope with them may be a further obstacle to their use. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   Landscape}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation is rapidly transforming primary forests across the tropics
   into human-dominated landscapes. Consequently, conservationists need to
   understand how different taxa respond and adapt to these changes in
   order to develop appropriate management strategies. Our two year study
   seeks to determine how wild Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) adapt to
   living in an isolated agroforest landscape by investigating the sex of
   crop-raiders related to population demographics, and their temporal
   variations in feeding behaviour and dietary composition. From focal
   animal sampling we found that nine identified females raided cultivated
   fruits more than the four males. Seasonal adaptations were shown through
   orangutan feeding habits that shifted from being predominantly
   fruit-based (56\% of the total feeding time, then 22\% on bark) to the
   fallback food of bark (44\%, then 35\% on fruits), when key cultivated
   resources such as jackfruit (Artocarpus integer), were unavailable.
   Cultivated fruits were mostly consumed in the afternoon and evening,
   when farmers had returned home. The finding that females take greater
   crop-raiding risks than males differs from previous human-primate
   conflict studies, probably because of the low risks associated (as
   farmers rarely retaliated) and low intraspecific competition between
   males. Thus, the behavioral ecology of orangutans living in this
   human-dominated landscape differs markedly from that in primary forest,
   where orangutans have a strictly wild food diet, even where primary
   rainforests directly borders farmland. The importance of wild food
   availability was clearly illustrated in this study with 21\% of the
   total orangutan feeding time being allocated to feeding on cultivated
   fruits. As forests are increasingly converted to cultivation, humans and
   orangutans are predicted to come into conflict more frequently. This
   study reveals orangutan adaptations for coexisting with humans, e. g.
   changes in temporal foraging patterns, which should be used for guiding
   the development of specific human-wildlife conflict mitigation
   strategies to lessen future crop-raiding and conflicts.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{753-760}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Foraging herbivores must deal with plant characteristics that
   inhibit feeding and they must avoid being eaten. Principally, toxins
   limit food intake, while predation risk alters how long animals are
   prepared to harvest resources. Each of these factors strongly affects
   how herbivores use food patches, and both constraints can pose immediate
   proximate costs and long-term consequences to fitness.
   2. Using a generalist mammalian herbivore, the common brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula), our aim was to quantitatively compare the
   influence of plant toxin and predation risk on foraging decisions.
   3. We performed a titration experiment by offering animals a choice
   between non-toxic food at a risky patch paired with food with one of
   five toxin concentrations at a safe patch. This allowed us to identify
   the tipping point, where the cost of toxin in the safe food patch was
   equivalent to the perceived predation risk in the alternative patch.
   4. At low toxin concentration, animals ate more from the safe than the
   risky patch. As toxin concentration increased at the safe patch, intake
   shifted until animals ate mainly from the risky patch. This shift was
   associated with behavioural changes: animals spent more time and fed
   longer at the risky patch, while vigilance increased at both risky and
   safe patches.
   5. Our results demonstrate that the variation in toxin concentration,
   which occurs intraspecifically among plants, can critically influence
   the relative cost of predation risk on foraging. We show that herbivores
   quantify, compare and balance these two different but proximate costs,
   altering their foraging patterns in the process. This has potential
   ecological and evolutionary implications for the production of plant
   defence compounds in relation to spatial variation in predation risk to
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviour associated with the defence of a territory is
   thought to impose substantial energy costs and thus to represent a
   trade-off with other energy-demanding activities. The energy costs of
   aggressive behaviours, however, have rarely been estimated in the wild,
   and the overall contribution of territorial defence to daily energy
   expenditure has never been determined. We studied the activity budget of
   breeding king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, equipped with heart
   rate data loggers to estimate the energy costs associated with territory
   defence in this colonial bird exhibiting very high rates of agonistic
   interactions. We also assessed whether threat displays imposed lower
   energy costs than attacks with body contact. During territorial defence
   (i.e. threats and physical attacks combined), energy expenditure
   averaged 1.27 times resting metabolic rate. Defence accounted for 13\%
   of the daily time budget and contributed to 2.7\% of the total daily
   energy expenditure. Interactions with body contact cost three times more
   than threat displays, but accounted for only 16\% of the aggressive
   behaviours recorded. Neither did body mass, body size, penguin sex or
   breeding stage affect the cost of aggressiveness. Our results are
   consistent with previous research reporting that fighting imposes
   significant metabolic costs. However, we found that aggressive behaviour
   in king penguins was not an expensive activity compared to the total
   energy budget. Because king penguins go without food and are sleep
   deprived while breeding, they may have developed behavioural strategies
   (e.g. lower rates of attacks with body contact) allowing them to defend
   their territory efficiently at a low energy cost. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Proinflammatory adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) contribute to
   obesity-associated disease morbidity. We will provide an update of the
   current state of knowledge regarding the phenotypic and functional
   diversity of ATMs in lean and obese mice and humans.
   Recent findings
   The phenotypic diversity of ATMs is now known to include more than two
   types requiring an expansion of the simple concept of an M2 to M1 shift
   with obesity. Potential functions for ATMs now include the regulation of
   fibrosis and response to acute lipolysis in states of caloric
   restriction. Novel pathways that can potentiate ATM action have been
   identified, which include inflammasome activation and the response to
   lipodystrophic adipose tissue. Studies provide a new appreciation for
   the ability of ATMs to respond dynamically to the adipose tissue
   microenvironment.
   Summary
   ATMs play a key role in shaping the inflammatory milieu within adipose
   tissue, and it is now apparent that ATM heterogeneity is acutely shaped
   by the adipose tissue environment. To account for the new findings, we
   propose a new nomenclature for ATM subtypes that takes into account
   their diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Seed selection, removal and subsequent management by granivorous animals
   is thought to be a complex interaction of factors including qualities of
   the seeds themselves (e.g., seed size, nutritional quality) and features
   of the local habitat (e.g. perceived predator risk). At the same time,
   differential seed selection and dispersal is thought to have profound
   effects on seed fate and potentially vegetation dynamics. In a feeding
   arena, we tested whether rodent species, seed species, and indirect and
   direct predation cues influence seed selection and handling behaviors
   (e.g., scatter hoarding versus larder hoarding) of two heteromyid
   rodents, Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) and the Great Basin pocket
   mouse (Perognathus parvus). The indirect cue was shrub cover, a feature
   of the environment. Direct cues, presented individually, were (1)
   control, (2) coyote (Canis latrans) vocalization, (3) coyote scent, (4)
   red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scent, or (5) short-eared owl (Asio flammeus)
   vocalization. We offered seeds of three sizes: two native grasses,
   Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) and bluebunch wheatgrass
   (Pseudoroegneria spicata), and the non-native cereal rye (Secale
   cereale), each in separate trays. Kangaroo rats preferentially harvested
   Indian ricegrass while pocket mice predominately harvested Indian
   ricegrass and cereal rye. Pocket mice were more likely to scatter hoard
   preferred seeds, whereas kangaroo rats mostly consumed and/or larder
   hoarded preferred seeds. No predator cue significantly affected seed
   preferences. However, both species altered seed handling behavior in
   response to direct predation cues by leaving more seeds available in the
   seed pool, though they responded to different predator cues. If these
   results translate to natural dynamics on the landscape, the two rodents
   are expected to have different impacts on seed survival and plant
   recruitment via their different seed selection and seed handling
   behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, obesity was considered the product of interactions
   between genotype and lifestyle. However, recent work suggests that the
   genetic heritability of adiposity has been over-estimated, whilst
   epidemiological studies show that although many genes are associated
   with nutritional status, the effect of each is very small. A polygenic
   basis of obesity risk may arise through bet-hedging of numerous traits
   to accommodate diverse unpredictable environments, rather than through
   systematic local adaptation. Such `fragmentation' of the genetic
   component of metabolism across multiple alleles may be a necessary
   pre-requisite for complementary enhancement of phenotypic plasticity.
   The inter-generational component of obesity refers to phenotypic effects
   transmitted across generations, arising from exposure to maternal,
   familial and environmental niches during development. Inter-generational
   transfers of somatic capital (height, lean mass) may respond to
   ecological conditions through a slow-response damping system, through
   the influence of maternal phenotype on offspring growth and body
   composition. The primary traits subject to inter-generational effects
   may be physique and life history strategy, with adiposity both aiding
   and responding as a flexible risk management strategy. The biological
   processes that underpin the offspring's developmental plasticity appear
   sensitive to the obesogenic niche. Through this sensitivity, diverse
   environmental factors can induce excess weight gain from childhood
   onwards.}},

   (N = 1175, aged 20-25 years, 54.7\% women). In women, additive genetic
   effects (heritability) accounted for 61\% of variation in food
   neophobia, whereas in men, shared environmental effects explained 45\%
   of the variation. Food neophobia negatively correlated with the
   personality trait Openness, corrected for the structural overlap (r =
   -0.23), and in women, these two traits had a genetic correlation (r (g)
   = -0.39). In addition, food neophobia negatively correlated with
   pleasantness and use frequency of fruits and vegetables and of fish and
   with mean pleasantness of foods. Once evolutionarily important, food
   neophobia should at present be considered in nutrition counseling as a
   possible barrier to a balanced diet.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated monozygotic twin pairs with discordant
   age-related macular degeneration (AMD) phenotypes to assess differences
   in behavioral and nutritional factors.
   Design: Case series.
   Participants: Caucasian male twin pairs from the United States Twin
   Study of Macular Degeneration.
   Methods: Twin pairs were genotyped to confirm monozygosity. Ocular
   characteristics were evaluated based on fundus photographs using the
   Wisconsin Grading System and a 5-grade Clinical Age-Related Maculopathy
   Staging System. We selected twin pairs discordant in each of the
   following phenotypic categories: Stage of AMD (n = 28), drusen area (n =
   60), drusen size (n = 40), and increased pigment area (n = 56). The
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression were used to assess
   associations between behavioral and nutritional characteristics and each
   phenotype within discordant twin pairs.
   Main Outcome Measures: Differences in smoking and dietary factors within
   twin pairs discordant for stage of AMD, drusen area, drusen size, and
   pigment area.
   Results: Representative fundus photographs depict the discordant
   phenotypes. Pack-years of smoking were higher for the twin with the more
   advanced stage of AMD (P = 0.05). Higher dietary intake of vitamin D was
   present in the twins with less severe AMD (P = 0.01) and smaller drusen
   size (P = 0.05) compared with co-twins, adjusted for smoking and age.
   Dietary intakes of betaine and methionine were significantly higher in
   the twin with lower stage of AMD (P = 0.009) and smaller drusen area (P
   = 0.03), respectively.
   Conclusions: The twin with the more advanced stage of AMD, larger drusen
   area, drusen size, and pigment area tended to be the heavier smoker. The
   twin with the earlier stage of AMD, smaller drusen size and area, and
   less pigment tended to have higher dietary vitamin D, betaine, or
   methionine intake. Results suggest that behavioral and nutritional
   factors associated with epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the
   etiology of AMD, in addition to genetic susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess convergent validity, factorial validity,
   test-retest reliability and internal consistency of a diet quality food
   behaviour checklist (FBC) for low-literate, low-income Spanish speakers.
   Design: Participants (n 90) completed three dietary recalls, the
   Spanish-language version of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and the Spanish-language
   FBC. Factor structure was examined using principal component analysis.
   Spearman correlation coefficients between FBC item responses and
   nutrient intakes from 24 h recalls were used to estimate convergent
   validity. Correlation coefficients were also calculated between FBC item
   responses at two time points in another group of participants (n 71) to
   examine test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was
   determined for items within each sub-scale.
   Setting: Non-profit community agencies serving low-income clients,
   migrant farm worker camps and low-income housing sites in four
   California counties.
   Subjects: Spanish-speaking women (n 161) who met income eligibility for
   the SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education).
   Results: Factor analysis resulted in six sub-scales. Responses to
   nineteen food behaviour items were significantly correlated with
   hypothesized 24 h recall data (with a maximum correlation of 0.44 for
   drinking milk and calcium) or the USDA HFSSM (0.42 with the food
   security item). Coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from
   0.35 to 0.79. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.49 for the diet quality
   sub-scale to 0.80 for the fruit and vegetable sub-scale.
   Conclusions: The twenty-two-item FBC and instruction guide will be used
   to evaluate USDA community nutrition education interventions with
   low-literate Spanish speakers. This research contributes to the body of
   knowledge about this at-risk population in California.}},

Abstract = {{As farm animal welfare is high on the political and societal agendas of
   many countries, considerable pressure exists to establish audit programs
   in which farm animal welfare is routinely monitored. On-farm assessment
   of animal welfare, however, is time-consuming and costly. A promising
   strategy to monitor animal welfare more efficiently is to first estimate
   the level of animal welfare on a farm based on routine herd data that
   are available in national databases. It is not currently known which
   variables of routine herd data (VRHD) are associated with dairy cattle
   welfare indicators (WI). Our aim was to identify VRHD that are
   associated with WI in a literature review. The 27 VRHD used in this
   review included the main types of data that are currently collected in
   national herd databases of developed countries, and related to
   identification and registration, management, milk production, and
   reproduction of dairy herds. The 34 WI used in this review were based on
   the Welfare Quality Assessment Protocol for Cattle. The search yielded
   associations in 146 studies. Twenty-three VRHD were associated with 16
   WI. The VRHD that related to milk yield, culling, and reproduction were
   associated with the largest number of WI. Few associations were found
   for WI that referred to behavioral aspects of animal welfare,
   nonspecific disease symptoms, or resources-based indicators. For 18 WI,
   associations with VRHD were not significant (n = 5 WI) or no studies
   were found that investigated associations with VRHD (n = 13 WI). It was
   concluded that many VRHD have potential to estimate the level of animal
   welfare on dairy farms. As strengths of associations were not considered
   in this review, however, the true value of these VRHD should be further
   explored. Moreover, associations found at the animal level and in an
   experimental setting might not appear at the farm level and in common
   practice and should be investigated. Cross-sectional studies using
   integrated welfare scores at the farm level are needed to more
   accurately determine the potential of VRHD to estimate levels of animal
   welfare on dairy farms.}},

Abstract = {{Hatcheries often produce bold fish that are maladapted to survive in the
   wild, as absence of predators and selection for fast growth tend to
   favour risk-taking behaviors. Not surprisingly, losses of hatchery fish
   through predation can be high immediately after release and this may
   account for the failure of many ex-situ fish conservation programmes.
   For supportive-breeding to be useful, it is essential that released fish
   are able to display natural behaviors. We compared the performance of
   juvenile Atlantic salmon reared in environmentally-enriched tanks
   receiving natural prey and subjected to simulated predator attacks with
   fish reared under standard hatchery conditions while keeping densities
   constant. No differences were detected between controls and
   environmentally enriched fish in survival, final size or nutritional
   status. Yet, changes in rearing conditions had rapid and marked effects
   on risk-taking behavior. Environmentally enriched fish were 2.1 times
   less willing, and took significantly longer to leave shelter, than
   controls within two weeks of enrichment. Thus our study indicates that
   it is possible through environmental enrichment to modify at least one
   component of fishes' behavior known to have clear adaptive implications,
   i.e. the propensity of hatchery-reared fish to take excessive risks.
   Ex-situ conservation could therefore benefit from rearing fish in
   naturalized, structurally complex environments with natural prey to
   promote the development of more natural behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is now evidence that developmental influences have lifelong
   effects on cardiovascular and metabolic function and that elements of
   the heritable or familial component of susceptibility to cardiovascular
   disease, obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCD) can be
   transmitted across generations by non-genomic means. In animals the
   developmental environment induces altered phenotypes through genetic,
   physiological (especially endocrine) and epigenetic mechanisms. The
   latter include DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histones and
   non-coding RNAs. Such `tuning' of phenotype has potential adaptive value
   and may confer Darwinian fitness advantage because it either adjusts the
   phenotype to current circumstances and/or attempts to match an
   individual's responses to the environment predicted to be experienced
   later. When the phenotype is mismatched to the later environment, e.g.
   from inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before
   birth, or from rapid environmental change through improved
   socio-economic conditions, risk of NCD increases. Such mechanisms are
   also thought to play roles in ageing and early onset of puberty,
   reinforcing a life-course perspective on such adaptive responses,
   especially the detrimental later effects of trade-offs. Epigenetic
   changes induced during development are highly gene-specific and function
   at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides in both gene promoter and
   intergenic regions. Evidence is accruing that endocrine or nutritional
   interventions during early postnatal life can reverse epigenetic and
   phenotypic changes induced, for example, by unbalanced maternal diet
   during pregnancy. Elucidation of epigenetic processes may permit
   perinatal identification of individuals most at risk of later NCD and
   enable early intervention strategies to reduce such risk. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Throughout its history, one of the most fascinating topics of psychiatry
   has been that of the causes and consequences of mental disorders. The
   desire to strengthen the reliability of diagnosis in this area has led
   to significant advances in two important fields: psychopathological
   description and the formulation of an integral diagnosis.
   Classifications allow the definition of categories and in the case of
   the two most read taxonomies in the field of mental health, Diagnostic
   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International
   Classification of Diseases (ICD), these provide the most commonly used
   criteria for diagnosis. The revised fourth edition of the DSM is now
   insufficient to cover the ever greater clinical challenges and research.
   For over ten years, work has been carried out on the structure of DSM-V
   (the fifth edition), but despite the planning, organization, prediction,
   and the contributions of guest experts, it is feared that all the
   requirements of modern psychiatry will not be met. The first edition of
   DSM was published in the 1950s. It was based on the terminology
   developed by William Meninger. This version of the manual and the
   following, published several years later, reflected the psychodynamic
   psychiatry which prevailed at the time. The third edition was published
   in 1980 and its revised edition seven years later. The emphasis here was
   on descriptive and syndromatic considerations. The fourth edition
   appeared several years later. The most striking change in this edition
   was the inclusion of variables resulting from empirical studies. A later
   edition was published in the year 2000.
   The first attempts to put together DSM-V started in 1999. From 1999
   until 2007 work was done on the planning of the investigation and
   technical documentation of DSM-V and the inclusion of the so called
   investigation schedules. The second phase of the project, known as the
   refinement of the research program for DSM-V, was carried out between
   2004 and 2007. A pilot test was undertaken between January and May 2010,
   among different segments of the population and different settings, to
   evaluate the revisions proposed by the working teams. Between March and
   April 2011, as a result of the field tests, the proposed criteria for
   diagnosis were reviewed. The dimensional measurements and the criteria
   for diagnosis will be reviewed again during the rest of 2011. The year
   2012 will see the preparation of the final version of the text, and
   finally, in May 2013, DSM-V will be presented at the annual meeting of
   the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco, California.
   Several external and independent authors have offered numerous proposals
   on topics related to psychopathology in general to the working groups
   formed for the preparation of DSM-V. Only some of these are mentioned
   below. One of the first factors to be taken into consideration in the
   revision of the manual is the need to distinguish between empirical
   questions or approaches and those of a more conceptual or philosophical
   nature, which should, by no means, be excluded. Another point to be
   evaluated is the advisability of defining phases according to the
   development of the condition, which would ideally create a schema
   focused on prevention. One of the expectations of psychiatry is that
   eventually laboratory criteria of diagnosis could be established, which
   could be measurable and would lead to clear statistics of psychiatric
   pathologies. As far as somatomorphic disorders are concerned, many
   practitioners agree that the current terminology and the systems of
   classification are inaccurate. One proposal is that this category should
   be eliminated altogether and that diagnoses should be made using an
   additional multidimensional description. One of the most interesting
   features of DSM is that it has had to accommodate changes brought about
   by new technologies. These advances go hand in hand with a new series of
   pathologies which need to be classified, as is the addiction to
   Internet.
   Undoubtedly, one of the greatest dilemmas facing DSM is how to classify
   eating disorders, as many people feel that the rather simplistic
   distinction between nervous anorexia and bulimia is not altogether
   convincing. There are two interesting proposals to consider in DSM-V:
   one is known as night eater syndrome and obesity, as in this case there
   is a compulsive consumption of food and an inability to limit this
   intake, in spite of a desire to do so. With regard to the compulsive,
   obsessive disorder, most experts believe that it is necessary to see the
   disorder as a spectrum, but defining criteria. Undeniably, a grave
   current problem which makes no distinctions is suicide. Different
   researchers recommend that suicidal behavior be considered and
   documented as a separate diagnosis in a sixth axis of the multioxis
   schema. Another important aspect concerns the giving of quality
   attention to patients. This has led to the proposal to expand DSM-V to
   include indicators for situations which could eventually be a cause for
   treatment. The proposal is to structure something different from what
   can be found in axis IV. In the case of paraphilias, it is deemed
   necessary that DSM-V should deal not only with the strictly descriptive
   aspect, but also with the semantic and linguistic. The importance of
   post-traumatic stress has been described, but there exists the doubt
   whether it is necessary to experience an adverse incident for this to be
   triggered. There has been a suggestion that the term ``pre-traumatic{''}
   stress disorder be included in DSM-V to diagnose this condition. In the
   case of anxiety disorders, some authors advise the creation of a
   category known as ``disorders caused by stress and fear{''}, which would
   allow linking the diagnostic classification with etiology and thus
   define a ``true{''} anxiety nosology. It would be advisable that the
   DSM-V included a category for ``seasonal affective disorder{''} as such,
   and not simply as a variant in the ``specification of the seasonal
   pattern{''} of depression. In the field of substance consumption, it has
   been argued that it is necessary to establish a classification which is
   not only categoric but also dimensional so as to improve its taxonomic
   usefulness. The organization of mental disorders in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10
   (tenth edition) is complex and this has led to exploring the feasibility
   of developing a meta-structural system of classification based on risk
   and clinical factors. For disorders originated in infancy, childhood and
   adolescence, it has been suggested that the disorder known as
   ``temperament disorder by disphoria{''} be included in the forthcoming
   taxonomy, as well as the use of the terms insensitive/emotionless for
   behavioral disorders, among others. In the case of attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the current criteria are considered
   insufficient and it has been suggested that the starting age for this
   disorder be increased from 7 to 12 years of age. It is suggested that
   autism be considered autistic spectrum, thus eliminating the other
   disorders covered in this section, including Asperger syndrome.
   The question as to whether this taxonomic-diagnostic system, to be
   implemented world-wide, will be both valid and reliable enough to cover
   all variations and particular characteristics of different cultures,
   ethnic groups, social groups and geographical regions in Mexico is
   another matter of concern, due to the lack of tools available for daily
   clinical work, except for the International Classification of Diseases
   of the World Health Organization. There are, at present, a number of
   doubts and queries which will need to be laid open and evaluated in all
   seriousness in order to obtain concrete and integral answers, given that
   the manual will continue to be used for clinical purposes in different
   parts of the world. The challenge will be to find the best way to apply
   diagnostic criteria, avoiding omissions and oversimplifications and
   taking into account the cultural and social context worked in.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The current status of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes
   and the effects of insecticides on nontarget insect species have raised
   the need for alternative control methods for malaria vectors. Predation
   has been suggested as one of the important regulation mechanisms for
   malaria vectors in long-lasting aquatic habitats, but the predation
   efficiency of the potential predators is largely unknown in the
   highlands of western Kenya. In the current study, we examined the
   predation efficiency of five predators on Anopheles gambiae s.s larvae
   in 24 hour and semi-field evaluations.
   Methods: Predators were collected from natural habitats and starved for
   12 hours prior to starting experiments. Preliminary experiments were
   conducted to ascertain the larval stage most predated by each predator
   species. When each larval instar was subjected to predation, third
   instar larvae were predated at the highest rate. Third instar larvae of
   An. gambiae were introduced into artificial habitats with and without
   refugia at various larval densities. The numbers of surviving larvae
   were counted after 24 hours in 24. In semi-field experiments, the larvae
   were counted daily until they were all either consumed or had developed
   to the pupal stage. Polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the
   presence of An. gambiae DNA in predator guts.
   Results: Experiments found that habitat type (P < 0.0001) and predator
   species (P < 0.0001) had a significant impact on the predation rate in
   the 24 hour evaluations. In semi-field experiments, predator species (P
   < 0.0001) and habitat type (P < 0.0001) were significant factors in both
   the daily survival and the overall developmental time of larvae.
   Pupation rates took significantly longer in habitats with refugia. An.
   gambiae DNA was found in at least three out of ten midguts for all
   predator species. Gambusia affins was the most efficient, being three
   times more efficient than tadpoles.
   Conclusion: These experiments provide insight into the efficiency of
   specific natural predators against mosquito larvae. These naturally
   occurring predators may be useful in biocontrol strategies for aquatic
   stage An. gambiae mosquitoes. Further investigations should be done in
   complex natural habitats for these predators.}},

   stretched-attend posture and risk assessment. These effects of stress
   were independent of the type of food consumed. Non-stressed rats
   ingesting comfort food decreased risk assessment as well. Stress and
   comfort food increased time spent in the center of the open field and
   delayed the first crossing to a new quadrant. Stress increased the
   plasma level of glucose and insulin, and reduced triglycerides, although
   consumption of comfort food increases glucose, triglyceride and leptin
   levels; no effect on leptin level was associated to stress. The stress
   induced increase in serum corticosterone was attenuated when rats had
   access to comfort food. It was concluded that foot-shock stress has an
   anorexigenic effect that is independent of leptin and prevented upon
   access to comfort food. Foot-shock stress also has an anxiolytic effect
   that is potentiated by the ingestion of comfort food and that is
   evidenced by both EPM and open field tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Mouse maternal systemic inflammation at the zygote stage causes blunted
   cytokine responsiveness in lipopolysaccharide-challenged adult offspring}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The preimplantation embryo is sensitive to culture
   conditions in vitro and poor maternal diet in vivo. Such environmental
   perturbations can have long-lasting detrimental consequences for
   offspring health and physiology. However, early embryo susceptibility to
   other aspects of maternal health and their potential long-term influence
   into adulthood is relatively unexplored. In this study, we established
   an in vivo mouse model of maternal periconceptional systemic
   inflammation by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration
   on the day of zygote formation and investigated the consequences into
   adulthood.
   Results: In the short term, maternal LPS challenge induced a transient
   and typical maternal sickness response (elevated serum proinflammatory
   cytokines and hypoactive behaviour). Maternal LPS challenge altered
   preimplantation embryo morphogenesis and cell lineage allocation,
   resulting in reduced blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM) cell number and a
   reduced ICM: trophectoderm cell ratio. In the long term, diverse aspects
   of offspring physiology were affected by maternal LPS treatment. Whilst
   birthweight, growth and adult blood pressure were unaltered, reduced
   activity in an open-field behaviour test, increased fat pad: body weight
   ratio and increased body mass index were observed in male, but not
   female, offspring. Most importantly, the maternal LPS challenge caused
   corticosterone-independent blunting of the serum proinflammatory
   cytokine response to innate immune challenge in both male and female
   offspring. The suppressed state of innate immunity in challenged
   offspring was dose-dependent with respect to the maternal LPS
   concentration administered.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate for the first time that the
   preimplantation embryo in vivo is sensitive to maternal systemic
   inflammation, with effects on blastocyst cell lineage allocation and
   consequences for behaviour, adiposity and innate immune response in
   adult offspring. Critically, we identify a novel mechanism mediated
   through maternal-embryonic interactions that confers plasticity in the
   development of the innate immune system, which is potentially important
   in setting postnatal tolerance to environmental pathogens. Our study
   extends the concept of developmental programming of health and disease
   to include maternal health at the time of conception.}},

   Photosynthesis by the Marine Gastropod, Elysia clarki}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{It has been well documented that nutritional state can influence the
   foraging behavior of animals. However, photosynthetic animals, those
   capable of both heterotrophy and symbiotic photosynthesis, may have a
   delayed behavioral response due to their ability to photosynthesize. To
   test this hypothesis we subjected groups of the kleptoplastic sea slug,
   Elysia clarki, to a gradient of starvation treatments of 4, 8, and 12
   weeks plus a satiated control. Compared to the control group, slugs
   starved 8 and 12 weeks displayed a significant increase in the
   proportion of slugs feeding and a significant decrease in photosynthetic
   capability, as measured in maximum quantum yield and {[}chl a]. The 4
   week group, however, showed no significant difference in feeding
   behavior or in the metrics of photosynthesis compared to the control.
   This suggests that photosynthesis in E. clarki, thought to be linked to
   horizontally-transferred algal genes, delays a behavioral response to
   starvation. This is the first demonstration of a link between
   photosynthetic capability in an animal and a modification of foraging
   behavior under conditions of starvation.}},

Abstract = {{In the laboratory, food restriction has been shown to induce
   neuroadaptations in brain reward circuitry which are likely to be among
   those that facilitate survival during periods of food scarcity in the
   wild. However, the upregulation of mechanisms that promote foraging and
   reward-related learning may pose a hazard when food restriction is
   self-imposed in an ecology of abundant appetitive rewards. For example,
   episodes of loss of control during weight-loss dieting, use of drugs
   with addictive potential as diet aids, and alternating fasting with
   alcohol consumption in order to avoid weight gain, may induce synaptic
   plasticity that increases the risk of enduring maladaptive
   reward-directed behavior. In the present mini-review, representative
   basic research findings are outlined which indicate that food
   restriction alters the function of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons,
   potentiates cellular and behavioral responses to D-1 and D-2 dopamine
   receptor stimulation, and increases stimulus-induced synaptic insertion
   of AMPA receptors in nucleus accumbens. Possible mechanistic
   underpinnings of increased drug reward magnitude, drug-seeking, and
   binge intake of sucrose in food-restricted animal subjects are discussed
   and possible implications for human weight-loss dieting are considered.

Abstract = {{Male mate choice is predicted to evolve as male investment in mating
   increases. Thus, taxa in which males pay a high cost for mating offer
   researchers an ideal system to test traditional sex roles. Males
   courting potentially sexually cannibalistic females may be under strong
   selection to bias their courtship efforts away from hungry females that
   may be more likely to attack. Here we tested the prediction that
   web-based chemotactile cues of recent female foraging success influence
   male courtship in the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. In
   addition, we tested the underlying assumption that previous female
   foraging success reduces precopulatory sexually cannibalistic attacks.
   We found that males courted well-fed females significantly more than
   they did starved females, and that this bias was maintained in the
   absence of the female when males encountered only (1) cues from female
   webs and (2) cues from female silk after web architecture had been
   eliminated. A nonsignificant courtship bias in favour of well-fed
   females was also evident when these females were transplanted to the
   webs of starved females. Male courtship biases in favour of well-fed
   females appear adaptive, as starved females were significantly more
   likely to attack males before mating. We conclude by noting that sexual
   cannibalism offers a model system wherein the exploitation of cues of
   predation risk have unique implications such as the effects on male
   courtship preferences seen here. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{626-639}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Foraging theory was first developed to predict the behaviour of
   widely-foraging animals that actively search for prey. Although the
   behaviour of sit-and-wait predators often follows predictions derived
   from foraging theory, the similarity between these two distinct groups
   of predators is not always obvious. In this review, we compare foraging
   activities of trap-building predators (mainly pit-building antlions and
   web-building spiders), a specific group of sit-and-wait predators that
   construct traps as a foraging device, with those of widely-foraging
   predators. We refer to modifications of the trap characteristics as
   analogous to changes in foraging intensity. Our review illustrates that
   the responses of trap-building and widely-foraging predators to
   different internal and external factors, such as hunger level,
   conspecific density and predation threat are quite similar, calling for
   additional studies of foraging theory using trap-building predators. In
   each chapter of this review, we summarize the response of trap-building
   predators to a different factor, while contrasting it with the
   equivalent response characterizing widely-foraging predators. We provide
   here evidence that the behaviour of trap-building predators is not
   stereotypic or fixed as was once commonly accepted, rather it can vary
   greatly, depending on the individual's internal state and its

Abstract = {{The neuroimmunological and behavioral consequences of a high-fat diet
   (HFD) are not well delineated. This is especially true when short term
   (24 h) fasting is used as a physiologic stressor. In this study, we
   examined the impact of a HFD on learning and memory and depressive-like
   behaviors to understand how fasting impacts neuroimmunity and whether
   obesity modulates the response. Mice were fed diets containing either
   10\% (low-fat diet (LFD) mice) or 60\% (HFD mice) calories from fat for
   10-12 weeks. Gene transcripts for 26 pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines
   and markers of macrophage activation were examined in adipose tissue and
   whole brain. Mouse learning and memory (spontaneous alternation, novel
   object) and depressive-like behaviors (saccharin preference, burrowing,
   forced swim) were studied in the fed and fasted state as were gene
   transcripts for F4/80, CD11b, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1
   beta, IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-1RA, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in
   cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. In the fed state, HFD mice
   compared to LFD mice had reduced locomotor activity, and were adverse to
   saccharin and burrowed less. After fasting, LFD mice vs. HFD mice lost
   18 vs. 5\% of their body weight, respectively. In addition, HFD mice
   failed to downregulate gene transcripts for the myeloid-cell associated
   proteins F4/80, CD11b and IL-1 alpha in the brain, failed to
   appropriately explore a novel object, failed to reduce locomotor
   activity and had increased saccharin consumption and burrowing. These
   data indicate that fasting induces an anti-inflammatory effect on the
   neuroimmune system which a HFD prevents. This breakdown appears linked
   to the IL-1 system because of the association of this cytokine with

Abstract = {{Visitors are known to affect zoo animals, and such effects may be
   stressful, neutral, or enriching. The majority of research has focused
   on visitor number or visitor presence-absence, yet few studies have
   examined effects of other variables such as sound volume, visitor
   activity, and whether visitors interact with animals. In this study, the
   effects of visitor number, activity and proximity to animals were
   investigated on a group of captive orangutans in two treetop,
   `free-ranging' exhibits at Singapore Zoo. Multinomial logistic
   regressions were used to elucidate the relationships between visitor and
   orangutan behaviours. Results from these analyses revealed a significant
   overall effect of the three visitor variables on orangutan behaviour.
   Interestingly, visitor number had little effect on the orangutans,
   except at one of the exhibits where the likelihood of food soliciting
   and looking at visitors increased when the number of people numbered
   more than 40. Visitor activity was generally not associated with any
   obvious signs of stress in the orangutans; visitors with food could even
   be a form of enrichment. However, visitors at close proximity decreased
   play behaviour and increased the chances of animals looking at the
   visitors. Enclosure design and habituation could have alleviated visitor
   effects for these two groups of orangutans. This study shows how
   investigation of a wider range of visitor variables may allow for more
   meaningful conclusions about the visitor effect, and that other factors
   such as enclosure design and habituation to visitors may also influence
   captive animal welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animals adjust their antipredator behavior according to environmental
   variation in risk, and to account for their ability to respond to
   threats. Intrinsic factors that influence an animal's ability to respond
   to predators (e. g., age, body condition) should explain variation in
   antipredator behavior. For example, a juvenile might allocate more time
   to vigilance than an adult because mortality as a result of predation is
   often high for this age class; however, the relationship between
   age/vulnerability and antipredator behavior is not always clear or as
   predicted. We explored the influence of intrinsic factors on
   yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) antipredator behavior using
   data pooled from 4 years of experiments. We hypothesized that inherently
   vulnerable animals (e. g., young, males, and individuals in poor
   condition) would exhibit more antipredator behavior prior to and
   immediately following conspecific alarm calls. As expected, males and
   yearlings suppressed foraging more than females and adults following
   alarm call playbacks. In contrast to predictions, animals in better
   condition respond more than animals in below average condition.
   Interestingly, these intrinsic properties did not influence baseline
   time budgets; animals of all ages, sexes, and condition levels devoted
   comparable amounts of time to foraging prior to alarm calls. Our results
   support the hypothesis that inherent differences in vulnerability
   influence antipredator behavior; furthermore, it appears that a crucial,
   but poorly acknowledged, interaction exists between risk and
   state-dependence. Elevated risk may be required to reveal the workings
   of state-dependent behavior, and studies of antipredator behavior in a
   single context may draw incomplete conclusions about age-or sex-specific
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Enrichment aims to improve captive animals' welfare by enhancing their

   Manipulating food presentation, walkways, and toys, we created five
   enrichment levels ranging from just above USDA standards to considerably
   more complex than the animals' normal housing. At the end of each level,
   a novelty test was performed in which an unfamiliar woman entered the

   enrichment condition were analyzed using a repeated-measures MANOVA.
   Compared to baseline, less enrichment consistently increased negative
   welfare indicators (abnormal behavior, aggression, and negative
   responses to the novelty test), while more enrichment sometimes
   decreased these indicators. Positive welfare indicators were less
   consistently related to enrichment, but positive response to the novelty
   test did increase somewhat in the most enriched condition. Across
   conditions, rank correlations revealed that individuals had highly
   consistent individual differences in positive responses to novelty and
   somewhat consistent individual differences in rates of aggression. The

Abstract = {{The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is the main vector of dengue
   and yellow fever viruses. Different methods have been used to control A.
   aegypti, including chemical and biological tools. However, chemical
   control can lead to a subsequent increase in the mosquitoes' insecticide
   resistance, and biological control represents an important method as an
   alternative to insecticide usage. Larvae from the Toxorhynchites genus
   (Diptera: Culicidae) are predators of other mosquitoes and represent a
   potential natural biocontrol agent of A. aegypti larvae. In the present
   work, A. aegypti larval survival was studied in the presence of the
   neotropical Toxorhynchites violaceus (Wiedemann, 1821) fourth instar
   larvae. Toxorhynchites violaceus consumption of A. aegypti increased
   during the 192 hours of the experiment and was more marked in the
   intervals between 96 and 120 hours and between 168 and 192 hours, when
   the A. aegypti survival reached 0\%. During the fourth instar, T
   violaceus increased its predation on A. aegypti larvae, possibly in
   order to increase its nutrient storage prior to pupation. Otherwise, low
   prey consumption can lead to a nutritional deficit for the larvae,
   delaying the adult's sexual development and reducing its egg production.
   Here we show that A. aegypti survival can be reduced by the T violaceus
   fourth larvae predation under laboratory conditions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Dispersal is a key process in population biology and ecology.
   Although the general ecological conditions that lead to dispersal have
   been well studied, the causes of individual variation in dispersal are
   less well understood. A number of recent studies suggest that heritable
   temperament - or personality - traits are correlated with dispersal in
   the wild but the extent to which these `personality-dispersal syndromes'
   are general, how they depend on an individual's state and on spatial
   scale and whether they are temporally stable, both within and across
   individuals, remains unclear.
   2. Here, we examine the relationship between exploration behaviour - an
   axis of personality that appears to be important in animals generally -
   and a variety of dispersal processes over 6 years in a population of the
   great tit Parus major.
   3. Exploration behaviour was higher in immigrant than in locally born
   juveniles, but the difference was much larger for individuals with a
   small body mass, though independent of sex, representing one of the
   first examples of a state-dependent effect in a personality-dispersal
   syndrome.
   4. Despite a temporal trend in exploration behaviour at the population
   level, the difference between immigrants and locally born birds remained
   stable over time, both across and within individuals. This suggests that
   the personality difference between immigrants and locally born birds is
   established early in development, but that the process of immigration
   interacts with both personality and state.
   5. We found that the number of immigrant parents a locally born bird had
   did not influence exploration behaviour, suggesting either the
   difference between immigrants and residents was environmental or that
   the effect is overridden by local environmental sources of variation.
   6. In contrast to previous work, we found no evidence for links between
   personality and natal dispersal distance within the population, either
   in terms of an individual's own exploration behaviour or that of its
   parents.
   7. Our results suggest that there are links between individual
   differences in personality and dispersal, but that these can be
   dependent on differences in state among individuals and on the scale
   over which dispersal is measured. Future work should aim to understand
   the differences between dispersal within and between populations and the
   ways in which personality and state interact to determine the outcome of
   these processes.}},

Abstract = {{1. Individuals of the same species often exhibit consistent differences
   in metabolic rate, but the effects of such differences on ecologically
   important behaviours remain largely unknown. In particular, it is
   unclear whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between
   metabolic rate and the tendency to take risks while foraging.
   Individuals with higher metabolic rates may need to take greater risks
   while foraging to obtain the additional food required to satisfy their
   energy requirements. Such a relationship could be exacerbated by food
   deprivation if a higher metabolic demand also causes greater mass loss
   and hunger.
   2. We investigated relationships among metabolic rate, risk-taking and
   tolerance of food deprivation in juvenile European sea bass. Individual
   fish were tested for risk-taking behaviours following a simulated
   predator attack, both before and after a 7-day period of food
   deprivation. The results were then related to their routine metabolic
   rate (RMR), which was measured throughout the period of food
   deprivation.
   3. The amount of risk displayed by individual fish before food
   deprivation showed no relationship with RMR. After food deprivation,
   however, the amount of risk among individuals was positively correlated
   with RMR. In general, most fish showed an increase in risk-taking after
   food deprivation, and the magnitude of the increase in risk-taking was
   correlated with the rate of individual mass loss during food
   deprivation, which was itself strongly correlated with RMR.
   4. The observation that RMR was related to risk-taking behaviour after
   food deprivation, but not before, suggests that although RMR can
   influence risk-taking, the strength of the relationship is flexible and
   context dependent. The effects of RMR on risk-taking may be subtle or
   non-existent in regularly feeding animals, but may lead to variability
   in risk-taking among individuals when food is scarce or supply is
   unpredictable. This synergistic relationship between RMR and food
   deprivation could lead to an increased likelihood of being predated for
   individuals with a relatively high intrinsic energy demand during times
   when food is scarce.}},

Abstract = {{Predation cues influence the strength of byssal attachment in bivalves.
   In zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, anchorage increases in response
   to nonforaging roach, Rutilus rutilus, but decreases in response to
   artificially crushed conspecifics, and it remains unaltered by
   nonforaging crayfish. Given that anchorage to hard substrata protects
   against dislodgement by predators, the defensive value of its weakening
   under predation threat is unclear. Our first experiment examined changes
   in the byssal attachment of zebra mussels in response to active
   predation by the spinycheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus. We found that
   zebra mussels decreased their attachment strength when exposed to cues
   released as crayfish foraged on conspecific mussels. Our second
   experiment tested whether crayfish have a capacity for chemosensory
   detection of live zebra mussels. We exposed hungry crayfish resting in
   shelters to water with or without cues from live mussels. The cues
   stimulated abandonment of shelters. Our results agree with recent
   findings that zebra mussels reduce filter feeding in response to
   predation cues that contain odours of crushed conspecifics. We suggest
   that this response helps zebra mussels to evade odour-navigating
   predators (e.g. crayfish) by suppressing the emission of disclosing
   metabolites, and that a consequence of this physiological suppression is
   a predator-mediated decrease in byssal attachment. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Animals are sensitive to risk or the variability of a reward
   distribution, and the energy budget rule of risk sensitivity theory
   predicts that it is adaptive for an animal to be risk averse when it is
   on a positive energy budget and to be risk prone when it is on a
   negative budget, because the utility of a potential large reward is much
   higher in the latter case. It has, however, been notoriously difficult
   to find conclusive empirical support for these predictions. We performed
   a comprehensive test of the energy budget rule in the honeybee, Apis
   mellifera, by constructing empirical utility functions and by testing
   the choice of bees for a constant or variable reward with an olfactory
   conditioning assay subsequent to manipulating their energy budgets. We
   demonstrate that a decline in energetic state leads to an increasing
   choice for a variable reward, while an increase in energetic state leads
   to an increased choice for a constant reward. We then show that subjects
   maintained on constant high or low energy budgets are risk indifferent,
   which suggests that an animal must perceive a change in its energetic
   state to be risk sensitive. We discuss the challenges of finding
   empirical evidence for the energy budget rule and the necessity of
   integrating physiological assays in these tests. Based on our previous
   results showing that parasitic infections cause an energetic stress in
   honeybees, we also discuss the possibility of energetic shortfall being
   responsible for the observed display of risky behaviour in infected
   bees. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The hatchery environment often favours completely different traits than
   natural selection in the wild. Consequently, hatchery-reared fish are
   usually larger and more aggressive than their wild counterparts.
   Increased growth rate and aggression are predicted to be beneficial in
   feeding competition in hatcheries, but not necessarily in nature, where
   food resources are spatially and temporally more variable. We compared
   the growth, condition and mortality of landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar L) juveniles in a common hatchery environment and when feeding on
   natural prey in semi-natural channels. We found that the growth and
   survival probability of the fish in the hatchery was negatively
   associated with their performance in the semi-natural channels.
   Furthermore, we found tendencies for directional selection (linear
   selection differential and gradient: P < 0.1, in both cases) against
   large body size in semi-natural channels, but not in the hatchery.
   Therefore, good performance during hatchery rearing may indicate reduced
   performance in food-limited natural conditions, where selection may
   favour smaller individuals that have a lower standard metabolic rate
   (higher growth efficiency). If our results are also valid in fully
   natural conditions, they suggest that selective stocking of the most

Abstract = {{Ecological theory suggests that the behaviour, growth and abundance of
   predators will be strongly influenced by the abundance of prey.
   Predators may in turn play an important role in structuring prey
   populations and communities. Responses of predators to variation in prey
   abundance have most commonly been demonstrated in low-diversity
   communities where food webs are relatively simple. How predators respond
   in highly diverse assemblages such as in coral reef habitats is largely
   unknown. This study describes an experiment that examined how the
   movement, diet and growth of the coral reef piscivore, Cephalopholis
   boenak (Serranidae) responded to variation in the abundance of its prey.
   Predator densities were standardised on small patch reefs made from the
   lagoonal reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica. These patch reefs
   exhibited natural variation in the abundance and community structure of
   multiple species of prey. However, our experiment generated a relatively
   simple predator-prey relationship, with C. boenak primarily responding
   to the most abundant species of prey. Three responses of predators were
   observed: aggregative, functional and developmental. Thirty-one per cent
   of individuals moved between patch reefs during the experiment, all from
   areas of relatively low to high prey density. Feeding rates were higher
   on patch reefs of high prey density, while growth rates of fish that
   remained on low prey density reefs throughout the experiment were lower.
   Growth rates of C. boenak on the experimental reefs were also much
   higher than for those living on natural patch reefs over the same time
   period, corresponding with overall differences in prey abundance. These
   results suggest that local abundance, feeding rate and growth of C.
   boenak were closely linked to the abundance of their main prey. This
   combination of predatory responses is a potential mechanism behind
   recent observations of density-dependent mortality and population
   regulation of prey in coral reef fish communities.}},

Abstract = {{1. Predators can reduce herbivory and increase plant biomass by
   consuming herbivores, lowering individual herbivore feeding rates, or
   both. We tested whether the presence of predators increases plant
   quality by non-consumptively reducing grazing pressure and thereby
   weakening the strength of the induced response in plant chemical
   defences.
   2. We performed a 42-day outdoor mesocosm experiment in which the
   herbivorous amphipod Ampithoe longimana was cultured on the brown
   seaweed Sargassum filipendula in the presence and absence of olfactory
   cues of its principal fish predator, the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. The
   presence of fish cues reduced per capita rates of amphipod grazing by
   nearly 50\%. Over the span of the mesocosm experiment, this per capita
   reduction in feeding rate yielded at least a 40\% lower growth rate of
   amphipod populations (i.e. r reduced from 1.01 to 0.61). The lower rates
   of amphipod grazing (overall or per capita) correlated with higher algal
   biomass.
   3. We pursued a series of laboratory-based feeding choice assays with
   naive amphipods to determine tissue palatability and the plant traits
   that mediate feeding choices. Tissue from tanks without grazers was more
   palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers, a pattern of induced
   plant defences that has been documented previously. Surprisingly,
   however, plant tissue from tanks with grazers and fish cues was more
   palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers but without fish cues. All
   changes in algal palatability were mediated by polar, but not lipophilic
   metabolites. These results suggest that the non-consumptive effects of
   fish predators increases the food quality of Sargassum by weakening the
   strength of its induced chemical defences.
   4. Synthesis. The smell of predators has the potential to regulate
   herbivore populations and affect the ecological dynamics of plant
   biomass and chemical defences.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, females are fed by males during courtship or incubation
   (mate-feeding). According to the mate appraisal hypothesis, females may
   evaluate the parental capacity of males, whereas the pair bond
   hypothesis suggests that feeding may strengthen the pair bonds with
   them. Following the nutrition hypothesis, by contrast, females obtain
   direct nutritional benefits from being fed by males during periods of
   high-energy expenditure, such as egg formation and incubation. However,
   there is little support for these hypotheses at an interspecific level.
   We tested predictions from these hypotheses in a dataset of 170 species
   of passerine birds. As predicted by the nutrition hypothesis, we found
   that mate-feeding has evolved more often in species in which the female
   incubates and builds the nest alone and have noncarnivorous diets. This
   suggests that mate-feeding is a behavioral strategy that compensates for
   nutritional limitations of females during breeding, as both incubation
   and nest building are energetically costly processes, and noncarnivorous
   diets are deficient in proteins. We also found that incubation feeding
   has evolved more often in species that place nests at elevated sites,
   suggesting that these species face low predation risk that allows males
   to feed females. In the particular case of incubation feeding, we found
   that species that have evolved this behavior produce larger clutch size
   and have higher hatching success. Our results support the nutrition
   hypothesis from an interspecific perspective, suggesting that
   matefeeding is a strategy to compensate for nutritional limitations of
   females during reproduction and that it has fitness consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives.-The study was designed to compare effects of food
   deprivation (FD) and sleep deprivation (SD) on cognition during survival
   training.
   Methods.-In a cross-over design (n = 12), the effects of FD (up to 66
   hours followed by 500 kcal intake over 24 hours) and SD (up to 50 hours)
   on cognitive variables, blood glucose, and 3-OH-butyrate were studied.
   Results.-Food deprivation and SD impaired attention-dependent tasks. The
   FD impairment of simple reaction time was independent of blood glucose
   levels, which were normalized by a 500 kcal intake over 24 hours while
   the reaction time was not. Sleep deprivation and FD impaired
   maze-solving performance on all variables except rule breaks, which were
   significantly occurring after 50 hours of SD. Delayed word recall was
   impaired by SD for 50 hours. On the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, SD was
   associated with reduced risk-taking. In a gambling task, both SD for 50
   hours and FD for 66 hours were associated with a tendency to make early
   choices when presented with consecutive choices, but the risk-taking was
   not affected.
   Conclusions.-Sleep deprivation has multiple cognitive effects, including
   attention, memory, visual-spatial ability, and risk-taking. Food
   deprivation had no affect on risk-taking, while the other tasks were
   affected in a way similar to SD but were less pronounced. The FD effects
   on cognition did not appear to depend on blood sugar levels. The need to

Abstract = {{Winter imposes physiological challenges on individuals including
   increased thermoregulatory demands, risk of infection, and decreased
   food availability. To survive these challenges, animals living outside
   the tropics must appropriately distribute their energetic costs across
   the year, including reproduction and immune function. Individuals of
   many species use the annual cycle of changing day lengths (photoperiod),
   which is encoded by the nightly duration of melatonin secretion, to
   adjust physiology. Siberian hamsters exposed to short days (SD) (long
   nights/prolonged endogenous melatonin secretion) enhance some aspects of
   immune function, but curtail other energetically expensive immune
   functions including the febrile response. The purpose of this study was
   twofold. First, we determined whether sustained melatonin treatment
   would inhibit the development of the SD phenotype in female hamsters as
   it does in males. Second, we examined whether the SD attenuation of
   fever would be blocked by continuous exposure to exogenous melatonin.
   Hamsters were implanted with melatonin or empty capsules, housed in
   either long days (LD) or SD for 8-9 weeks, and then challenged with
   lipopolysaccharide; body temperature and locomotor activity were
   recorded. Unlike hamsters with empty capsules, hamsters with melatonin
   implants did not respond to SD and maintained a LD phenotype including
   summer-like spleen, uterine and body masses, and pelage characteristics.
   Further, sustained melatonin treatment blocked the SD attenuation of
   febrile responses and prolonged the behavioral components of the
   sickness response. These results suggest that the daily fluctuations in
   endogenous melatonin may be masked by continuous exposure to exogenous
   melatonin, thus inhibiting functional photoperiodic responses to SD.}},

Abstract = {{Senescence may be considered the antithesis of early development, but
   yet there may be factors and mechanisms in common between these two
   phenomena during the process of aging. We investigated whether any
   relationship exists between the regulatory mechanisms that function in
   early development and in senescence using the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a
   small freshwater fish and a useful model animal for genetic studies. We
   conducted experiments to isolate zebrafish mutants expressing an
   apparent senescence phenotype during embryogenesis (embryonic
   senescence). Some of the genes we thereby identified had already been
   associated with cellular senescence and chronological aging in other
   organisms, but many had not yet been linked to these processes. Complete
   loss-of-function of developmentally essential genes induce embryonic (or
   larval) lethality, whereas it seems like their partial loss-of-function
   (i.e., decrease-of-function by heterozygote or hypomorphic mutations)
   still remains sufficient to go through the early developmental process
   because of its adaptive plasticity or rather heterozygote advantage.
   However, in some cases, such partial loss-of-function of genes
   compromise normal homeostasis due to haploinsufficiency later in adult
   life having many environmental stress challenges. By contrast, any
   heterozygote-advantageous genes might gain a certain benefit(s) (much
   more fitness) by such partial loss-of-function later in life.
   Physiological senescence may evolutionarily arise from both genetic and
   epigenetic drifts as well as from losing adaptive developmental
   plasticity in face of stress signals from the external environment that
   interacts with functions of multiple genes rather than effects of only a
   single gene mutation or defect. Previously uncharacterized developmental
   genes may thus mediate the aging process and play a pivotal role in
   senescence. Moreover, unexpected senescence-related genes might also be
   involved in the early developmental process and regulation. We wish to
   ascertain whether we can identify such genes promptly in a comprehensive
   manner. The ease of manipulation using the zebrafish system allows us to
   conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel genes and small molecular
   compounds that can be linked to the senescence phenotype and thereby
   facilitates searching for the evolutionary and developmental origins of
   aging in vertebrates. Birth Defects Research (Part C) 93:229-248, 2011.

   this regard, a meta-analysis revealed an overall significant effect of
   -0.81 (95\% CI of -1.44 to -0.17, p = 0.01) indicating an overall
   decrease in mean BMI associated with the interventions. There is a large
   body of evidence from all study designs which suggests that decreasing
   any type of sedentary time is associated with lower health risk in youth
   aged 5-17 years. In particular, the evidence suggests that daily TV
   viewing in excess of 2 hours is associated with reduced physical and
   psychosocial health, and that lowering sedentary time leads to
   reductions in BMI.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining the origins of novel traits is central to evolutionary
   biology. Longstanding theory suggests that developmental plasticity, the
   ability of an individual to modify its development in response to
   environmental conditions, might facilitate the evolution of novel
   traits. Yet whether and how such developmental flexibility promotes
   innovations that persist over evolutionary time remains unclear. Here,
   we examine three distinct ways by which developmental plasticity can
   promote evolutionary innovation. First, we show how the process of
   genetic accommodation provides a feasible and possibly common avenue by
   which environmentally induced phenotypes can become subject to heritable
   modification. Second, we posit that the developmental underpinnings of
   plasticity increase the degrees of freedom by which environmental and
   genetic factors influence ontogeny, thereby diversifying targets for
   evolutionary processes to act on and increasing opportunities for the
   construction of novel, functional and potentially adaptive phenotypes.
   Finally, we examine the developmental genetic architectures of
   environment-dependent trait expression, and highlight their specific
   implications for the evolutionary origin of novel traits. We critically
   review the empirical evidence supporting each of these processes, and
   propose future experiments and tests that would further illuminate the
   interplay between environmental factors, condition-dependent
   development, and the initiation and elaboration of novel phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Because key nutritional processes differ in their thermal optima,
   ectotherms may use temperature selection to optimize performance in
   changing nutritional environments. Such behaviour would be especially
   advantageous to small terrestrial animals, which have low thermal
   inertia and often have access to a wide range of environmental
   temperatures over small distances. Using the locust, Locusta migratoria,
   we have demonstrated a direct link between nutritional state and
   thermoregulatory behaviour. When faced with chronic restrictions to the
   supply of nutrients, locusts selected increasingly lower temperatures
   within a gradient, thereby maximizing nutrient use efficiency at the
   cost of slower growth. Over the shorter term, when locusts were unable
   to find a meal in the normal course of ad libitum feeding, they
   immediately adjusted their thermoregulatory behaviour, selecting a lower
   temperature at which assimilation efficiency was maximal. Thus, locusts
   use fine scale patterns of movement and temperature selection to adjust
   for reduced nutrient supply and thereby ameliorate associated
   life-history consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of invasive mammals to adjust their diet in response to new
   or variable resources is often proposed to explain their invasion
   success on islands with differing environmental conditions, especially
   islands with strong spatiotemporal changes in the nature and abundance
   of their resources. In this study, we investigated how habitat
   heterogeneity and seasonal fluctuation in resource quality affect
   dietary breadth and plasticity in an island-invasive rodent, the black
   rat Rattus rattus, on a small Mediterranean island. We tested for
   dietary plasticity of rats at both the individual and population levels
   by using traditional dietary and stable isotope analyses at successively
   increasing time scales, coupled with a long-term study of individual
   rats in three habitats of close proximity. Dietary and movement analyses
   both indicated that R. rattus is able to exploit a wide range of
   resources and habitats. However, dietary plasticity and habitat breadth
   were far narrower at the individual level. Results revealed that rats
   exclusively used resources found in their local habitat, and very few
   individuals moved among adjacent habitats in pursuit of higher-quality
   resources, despite those resources being abundant in their immediate
   environment. This counterintuitive finding suggests that intraspecific
   interactions must restrict rat mobility. Our results suggest that even
   on small islands, accessibility of patchy and high-quality resources to
   individuals from the entire population is not systematic. This result
   has important implications when quantifying invasive rodent impacts on
   patchily distributed species, especially when studies use indirect
   methods such as dietary analyses as a substitute for direct observations

Abstract = {{Unlike many species that are `occasional' cannibals, the tadpoles of
   cane toads specifically target conspecific eggs for consumption,
   ignoring the eggs of sympatric frog species (at least within the toads'
   current invasive range in Australia). We tested three hypotheses as to
   the benefits of consuming conspecific eggs: transfer of toxins from eggs
   (which have high toxin content) to tadpoles (which have lower toxin
   content), nutritional input, and reduction of future competition. We
   found no evidence of toxin transfer, but eggs contained sufficient
   nutrition for cannibalistic tadpoles to develop through to
   metamorphosis, and egg consumption enhanced rates of tadpole growth and
   differentiation through reduction of subsequent competition from younger
   tadpoles. Features of the cane toads' life history (e. g. synchronized
   deposition and development of all eggs within a clutch; delay between
   hatching and onset of feeding; short larval stage relative to
   interclutch interval of a given adult female) mean that the cannibals
   are unlikely to be close relatives of the younger conspecifics they
   consume (either as eggs or as metamorphs). Kin selection may thus favour
   rather than oppose cannibalism. The end result is that cannibalistic
   toad tadpoles benefit through nutrition and reduced future competition,
   with little collateral risk of eating their own siblings. Another
   potential cost of cannibalism (risk of disease transmission) may be
   minimal in this system, because the eggs are unlikely to contain
   pathogens (reflecting their brief embryonic periods and protective jelly
   layers). The combination of these forces has favoured the evolution of
   targeted cannibalism by cane toad tadpoles. (C) 2011 The Association for

Abstract = {{Risk-sensitive foraging theory is central to behavioural ecology. It
   relates individual fitness to variance in foraging success (risk) and
   predicts which foraging strategy maximizes fitness under applicable
   constraints. Fitness usually comprises survival and reproduction. Yet,
   most models of risk-sensitive foraging have focused on only one of these
   two factors. Consequently, such models cannot account for the
   interaction between resource availability and population size, i.e.
   density dependence.
   Here, we incorporate both mortality and reproduction as functions of an
   individual's risk-sensitive foraging strategy. In our model the
   individual strategy thus determines the mean availability of resources
   per capita and consequently the equilibrium population size. From a
   continuum of possible strategies we are able to pinpoint the exact
   risk-sensitive strategies that are favoured by natural selection in
   saturated habitats and demonstrate that, in addition to risk proneness
   and risk aversion, a number of optimal intermediate variances can be
   selected for.
   In contrast to predictions based on models that ignore the interaction
   between behaviour, population density and resource availability, our
   results show that high baseline mortality (e.g. predation risk) does not
   necessarily lead to risk proneness. In addition to this novel finding,
   our model confirms the crucial importance of resource-independent
   (baseline) mortality for optimal risk-sensitive behaviour. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{The effect of extended incubation (delayed hatching) on larval
   morphology in the terrestrially spawning common galaxias Galaxias
   maculatus was investigated by inducing larvae to hatch 1 and 2 weeks
   after the normal 2 week incubation period. After 1 week of extended
   incubation, larvae were larger (longer in standard length, L-S, and
   greater in body depth) compared to controls (larvae that experienced
   normal incubation durations). After 2 weeks of extended incubation,
   larvae were smaller (shorter in L-S and smaller in body depth) than
   larvae that experienced 1 week of extended incubation. Furthermore, eye
   area increased while yolk-sac size decreased monotonically with
   increasing incubation duration. These results suggest that larvae
   experiencing long periods of extended incubation are using somatic
   tissue to meet their metabolic demands. Larvae that experienced 2 weeks
   of extended incubation succumbed to starvation sooner than control
   larvae, but hatching success was not significantly different.
   Temperature mediated the effect of extended incubation on the morphology
   of larvae at hatching, most likely, through its effects on developmental
   rate and efficiency of yolk utilization. This study demonstrates some of
   the consequences of terrestrial spawning with extended incubation, which

Abstract = {{An increasing body of evidence suggests that poor nutrition at the very
   beginning of life even before birth - leads to large and long term
   negative consequences for both mental and physical health. This paper
   reviews the evidence from studies on the Dutch famine, which
   investigated the effects of prenatal undernutrition on later health. The
   effects of famine appeared to depend on its timing during gestation, and
   the organs and tissues undergoing critical periods of development at
   that time. Early gestation appeared to be the most vulnerable period.
   People who were conceived during the famine were at increased risk of
   schizophrenia and depression, they had a more atherogenic plasma lipid
   profile, were more responsive to stress and had a doubled rate of
   coronary heart disease. Also, they performed worse on cognitive tasks
   which may be a sign of accelerated ageing. People exposed during any
   period of gestation had more type 2 diabetes. Future investigation will
   expand on the finding that the effects of prenatal famine exposure may
   reach clown across generations, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms.
   Recent evidence suggests that similar effects of prenatal undernutrition
   are found in Africa, where many are undernourished. Hunger is a major
   problem worldwide with one in seven inhabitants of this planet suffering
   from lack of food. Adequately feeding women before and during pregnancy
   may be a promising strategy in preventing chronic diseases worldwide.

Abstract = {{Socioecological models suggest competition for food, foraging

   squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) appear to conform to the predictions of
   the predation/competition socioecological model (Sterck et al. in Behav
   Ecol Sociobiol 41:291-309, 1997) and the dispersal/foraging efficiency
   model (Isbell in Kinship and behavior in primates. Oxford University,
   New York, pp 71-108, 2004). However, squirrel monkeys in captivity are
   reported to maintain patterns of social behavior observed in their wild
   conspecifics despite different food distribution, predation risk, and
   dispersal options. This behavioral similarity suggests squirrel monkeys'
   social behavior has limited flexibility to respond to environmental
   changes. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the flexibility of
   social behavior within a captive group of S. sciureus. First, we
   determined whether dominance and affiliative relationships observed
   under normal laboratory conditions (with abundant, widely distributed,
   food; no dispersal option; and no predators) better matched published
   reports of relationships among wild conspecifics or the predictions of
   the predation/competition model. Second, we made preferred food items
   defensible to determine whether dominance interactions would become more
   frequent and linear, as predicted by the model. The model correctly
   predicted rates of dominance behavior in both conditions and a linear
   hierarchy in the defensible food condition but did not predict the
   consistent affiliative relationships and linear dominance hierarchy
   observed in normal lab conditions. Although hierarchies were linear and
   male dominant, manipulating food distribution changed the dominant
   individual within each sex. Our findings suggest interaction rates adapt
   more rapidly than social structure to environmental changes in Saimiri
   and recommend caution in interpreting tests of socioecological models.}},

   studied. We examined the diet and foraging behavior of C. horridus from
   four separate populations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A total of 253
   prey items from scat samples, stomach samples, and field observation
   were identified to species or family level. Although voles (Myodes

   that the diet composition of this ambush predator may not simply reflect
   the availability of prey species. Radioteiemetric observations of C.
   horridus further indicate differing frequencies of log-oriented foraging
   behavior among the study sites. Analysis of body posture revealed an

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is a significant global health problem, with the
   proportion of women entering pregnancy with a body mass index greater
   than or equal to 25 kg/m(2) approaching 50\%. Obesity during pregnancy
   is associated with a well-recognised increased risk of adverse health
   outcomes both for the woman and her infant, however there is more
   limited information available regarding effective interventions to
   improve health outcomes. The aims of this randomised controlled trial
   are to assess whether the implementation of a package of dietary and
   lifestyle advice to overweight and obese women during pregnancy to limit
   gestational weight gain is effective in improving maternal, fetal and
   infant health outcomes.
   Methods/Design: Design: Multicentred randomised, controlled trial.
   Inclusion Criteria: Women with a singleton, live gestation between
   10(+0)-20(+0) weeks who are obese or overweight (defined as body mass
   index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2), at the first antenatal visit.
   Trial Entry \& Randomisation: Eligible, consenting women will be
   randomised between 10(+0) and 20(+0) weeks gestation using a central
   telephone randomisation service, and randomisation schedule prepared by
   non-clinical research staff with balanced variable blocks.
   Stratification will be according to maternal BMI at trial entry, parity,
   and centre where planned to give birth.
   Treatment Schedules: Women randomised to the Dietary and Lifestyle
   Advice Group will receive a series of inputs from research assistants
   and research dietician to limit gestational weight gain, and will
   include a combination of dietary, exercise and behavioural strategies.
   Women randomised to the Standard Care Group will continue to receive
   their pregnancy care according to local hospital guidelines, which does
   not currently include routine provision of dietary, lifestyle and
   behavioural advice. Outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocated
   treatment group.
   Primary Study Outcome: infant large for gestational age (defined as
   infant birth weight >= 90(th) centile for gestational age).
   Sample Size: 2,180 women to detect a 30\% reduction in large for
   gestational age infants from 14.40\% (p = 0.05, 80\% power, two-tailed).
   Discussion: This is a protocol for a randomised trial. The findings will
   contribute to the development of evidence based clinical practice
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{There has been surprisingly little attention to adaptive variation in
   the locomotor speed and gaits used in antipredator behaviour. We
   investigated the relationship between body size and the use of two
   alternative gaits by three species of parrotfishes (princess, Scarus
   taeniopterus; queen, Scarus vetula; stoplight, Sparisoma viride)
   escaping an approaching snorkeller in their natural fringing reef
   habitat in Barbados. As body size increased from about 7 to 58 cm, the
   proportion of fish using an energetically more costly but relatively
   faster escape (body and caudal fin swimming) rather than a less costly
   and relatively slower escape (paired fin swimming) decreased from 100\%
   to 0\%. In contrast, the study confirmed previous research showing that
   larger fish fled at greater distances from the snorkellers, behaviour
   which would have increased safety but incurred higher opportunity costs.
   We conclude that small fish require a more expensive gait to attain an
   adequate escape speed. Thus, the gait used for escaping shows a
   compensatory relationship with body size because small individuals with
   lower swimming capacity use a higher proportion of that capacity. On the
   other hand, flight initiation distance shows cospecialization with body
   size because larger fish with higher swimming capacity further reduce
   their risk by fleeing sooner. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Maternal hypoprolactinemia at the end of lactation in rats reduces milk
   production and is associated with offspring's malnutrition. Since
   malnutrition during development is also known to have long lasting
   effects on cognition and emotion, in the present study we tested the
   hypothesis that maternal hypoprolactinemia, induced by bromocriptine
   treatment, at the end of the lactating period affects memory/learning,
   novelty-seeking and anxiety-like behaviors in adult male Wistar rats
   using, respectively, the radial arm water maze (RAWM), the hole board
   (HB) arena and the elevated plus-maze (EPNl). We also analyzed serum
   corticosterone and thyroid hormone levels at postnatal day (PN) 21.
   Lactating dams were treated with bromocriptine (BRO, 1 mg twice a day,
   inhibiting prolactin) or saline from PN19 to 21 (the last 3 days of
   lactation). BRO offspring had hypercorticosteronemia and hypothyroidism
   at PN21. In the RAWM, reductions in latency observed in CON rats were
   initially more accentuated than in BRO ones. By the end of the testing
   period, latencies became similar between groups. No difference was
   observed between groups regarding the number of nose-pokes in the HB. In

Abstract = {{Eating disorders and, in particular, anorexia nervosa (AN) have
   morbidity and mortality rates that are among the highest of any mental
   disorders and are associated with significant functional impairment.
   More than 25 years ago, several researchers hypothesised that the
   prerequisite for the development of AN was a family process
   characterised by an overprotective and conflict-avoiding parent-child
   interaction. Family studies, however, suggest that AN is a complex
   genetic disorder that is likely expressed primarily by temperament and
   specific traits during childhood, including inhibition, perfectionism
   and harm avoidance. Recent studies have described an impaired
   flexibility and deficits in social cognition that are independent of
   body weight and the current state of the eating disorder, providing
   further evidence for a genetic component of AN. The physiological and
   psychological alterations and the increasing societal demands that occur
   during puberty may trigger onset. The starvation process itself is
   associated with severe alterations of central and peripheral metabolism,
   especially neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter changes, which are
   thought to affect the adolescent brain during the vulnerable period of
   neural restructuring. Long-standing malnutrition during adolescence and
   young adulthood associated with hormonal and neuropeptide dysfunctions
   may produce ``biological scars{''} that maintain and accelerate the
   disorder and likely result in chronic mental disorders in adulthood as
   well as poor social functioning.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of how infant eating behaviour relates to later obesity

   this paper is to review findings from the Gateshead Millennium Study to

   behaviour and (ii) describe new analyses that examine how infant eating
   behaviour and temperament relate to infancy weight gain and childhood
   adiposity. The Gateshead Millennium Study recruited 1029 infants at
   birth and parents completed questionnaires five times in the first year.
   We have already described how starting solids and ceasing breast-feeding
   seems to be a response to rapid early weight gain, rather than a cause,
   and that parents identify and respond to the individual appetite
   characteristics of their child. A number of questions about eating
   behaviour at 12 months were used to construct an infancy eating avidity
   score that was positively associated with height at age 7-8 years, but
   not with an adiposity index constructed using bioelectrical impedance,
   waist and skinfolds. Infancy eating avidity score was associated with
   greater fussiness and lower satiety responsivity on the Child Eating
   Behaviour Questionnaire at age 6-8 years. Temperament measured at age 6
   weeks and 8 months showed no consistent associations with either infancy
   weight gain or adiposity at 6-8 years. While infancy may seem a logical

   collective findings from this substantial population-based study largely
   suggest otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{Capture and temporary confinement of wild birds are integral parts of
   wildlife management practice and research used, for example, during
   translocation or reintroduction initiatives. We report here on the
   behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild
   blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly
   consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the
   relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations.
   Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration,
   integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day
   confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 +/- 66.6 (mean +/- S.E.)
   and 678.2 +/- 115.8 ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of
   corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8
   and 2.2 ng/mL respectively, P < 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week
   period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased
   propensity for locomotory behaviours (P = 0.001), maintenance behaviours
   (P = 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P = 0.04) over the period of
   captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P < 0.001) decreased,
   probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated
   decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual
   behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation
   days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability
   (Repeatability = 0.592 +/- 0.084, P < 0.0001). Significant
   repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations
   measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability = 0.619 +/- 0.166, P =
   0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability = 0.368
   +/- 0.166, P = 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We
   used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of
   locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was
   positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response
   at release (P = 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation
   days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P
   = 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days
   after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the
   behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity,
   may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement
   that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival. (C) 2011

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Animals can mitigate the consequences of conflicting food-web
   constraints (e.g. resource availability vs. predation risk) through
   plasticity in the expression of functional traits. Because functional
   trait expression in turn determines a species impact on ecosystem
   functions, e.g. its trophic function, there is a growing need to develop
   a predictive theory that links trait plasticity to ecosystem
   functioning. But there is currently an incomplete empirical foundation
   on which to develop such theory.
   2. To address this issue, we explored the link between plasticity in a
   suite of traits (e.g. head morphology, gut size, bite size) that
   determine the trophic function of a generalist grasshopper herbivore
   facing predation risk. We reared grasshoppers in the field under two
   single-forage environments where the plant resources had different
   physical and nutritional properties and in intermediate mixed-forage
   environments with or without risk of spider predation.
   3. We found that in the single-forage environments, grasshoppers became
   more efficient at ingesting the resource they were reared on.
   4. In mixed-resource environments, grasshoppers developed a phenotype
   that was not intermediate to the phenotypes in the two single-forage
   environments, regardless of predation risk.
   5. We propose that the suite of phenotypic changes observed in our study
   represent two alternative feeding strategies that vary with the
   possibility of using behavioural resource selection in different
   environmental contexts.
   6. Our results suggest that plasticity in trophic function may not
   emerge from a direct link between the primary traits that determine
   consumer consumption efficiency given the physical properties of its
   resources (as is customarily presumed) but rather indirectly from
   secondary traits that may remain latent until such time that they are
   drawn into play when the species faces a particular challenge. This
   means that fully understanding how functional traits influence a
   species' role in an ecosystem requires consideration of a broader suite
   of traits than simply those assumed to constrain resource ingestion.}},

Abstract = {{Rational and objectives Neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic peptide that
   is released during periods of food restriction, has been shown to have a
   significant modulatory impact on drug-related behaviors. We have
   previously reported that both acute food deprivation (FD) and NPY
   injections can reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behavior, a proposed
   animal model of relapse to drug abuse. However, it is not clear whether
   the FD effect on drug seeking is dependent on NPY transmission. Here, we
   used the reinstatement model to assess the role of NPY Y1 and
   Y5-receptor-mediated transmission in FD-induced reinstatement of heroin
   seeking.
   Methods Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 10-12 days (0.1
   mg/kg/infusion/intravenous). Animals then underwent extinction training
   followed by drug-seeking reinstatement tests under 21 h of FD and sated
   conditions.
   Results Injections of a novel NPY Y5-receptor antagonist, Lu AA33810
   (0.0, 1.0, or 30.0 mg/kg/IP), resulted in a significant attenuation of
   FD-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking. However, no
   significant effects on reinstatement were found for the Y1-receptor
   antagonist, BIBO 3304 (0.0, 5.0, or 10.0 nmol/intracerebroventricular).
   Conclusions These results suggest that while signals mediated through
   NPY Y1 receptors play a modest role in reinstatement, activation of Y5
   receptors has a critical function in FD-induced reinstatement of
   heroin-seeking behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Promiscuous and repeated mountings by females are evolutionarily
   intriguing as females are expected to be choosy and matings are expected
   to be costly. We evaluate the evolutionary basis of these behaviours in
   a high-density population of European badgers. We analysed postpartum
   mounting behaviour, in 3 years, at two neighbouring social groups each
   year. We demonstrate a polygynandrous social mating system, with
   repeated mounting. Mounting was skewed among females in four
   social-group-years, but overall did not differ from random, potentially
   because female reproductive success is context dependent, varying with
   local food availability and female-female competition. Some males
   mounted more than others; however, male mounting frequency was not
   related to dominance rank, self-grooming rate, or body condition index.
   Mounting frequency did not predict paternity success; furthermore, a
   16-year genetic data set showed that paternity success was positively
   correlated with body condition index. Females may therefore mount with
   males that do not father their offspring to minimize the risk of
   infanticide from them. Females may also trade mountings for allogrooming
   from males, but mounting frequency did not vary with relatedness,
   aggression received from males or sequential allomarking by males. We
   conclude that promiscuous and repeated mounting in badgers may have
   evolved to reduce male-male aggression around mounting and the
   likelihood of infanticide from males by masking paternity. Promiscuous
   mounting of female badgers does not devalue the previous male's sperm,
   but may promote sperm competition, genetic diversity and genetic
   compatibility. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Aggressive interactions in animals are often resolved in favour of the
   individual with superior fighting ability, or resource-holding potential
   (RHP). A recent revival of studies of aggressive behaviour has focused
   on the assessment strategies used in animal contests. Strategies of
   dispute resolution through mutual or self-assessment of RHP differ in
   the predicted relationship between interaction duration and each
   competitor's relative and absolute RHP. We studied potential components
   of RHP (mass, length, body condition) and their relationship to contest
   duration and the level of escalation in the grey treefrog, Hyla
   versicolor, using a novel method to stage aggressive interactions in the
   laboratory. Overall, large males were more likely to win than small
   males, but they only had an advantage in less escalated interactions and
   were not more successful in physical fights. There was limited evidence
   for an effect of body size on interaction duration or the level of
   escalation. Specifically, the body condition of both the smaller and
   larger contestant was weakly negatively related to the duration and
   level of escalation of contests. This relationship is the opposite of
   what would be expected under any assessment strategy. Given these data,
   coupled with the lack of relationships between other size measures and
   interaction duration, we conclude that assessment of body size does not
   occur in contests in H. versicolor. Other unmeasured components of RHP
   may play a role in determining interaction duration, and the relatively
   weak and ineffective fighting abilities of this species may limit the
   dominance of larger individuals. Relatively little is known about
   aggressive behaviour in frogs. Our method for staging aggressive
   interactions allows us to address predictions of game theory models in

   dolphins, Sousa chinensis, off the northeast coast of Queensland.
   Schools of snubfin dolphins were larger and more stable, irrespective of

   associations of both species showed nonrandom patterns and structure,
   the social network of snubfin dolphins was characterized by numerous
   strong associations, whereas the strength of the humpback dolphin's
   social network did not differ from random. Modelling of temporal
   patterns of association indicated long-lasting associations were an
   important feature of snubfin dolphins' fission-fusion dynamics. In

   concentrations make more stream area energetically profitable for drift
   feeders. The behaviour most responsible for this response was activity
   selection: when food was abundant, fish chose to feed less frequently
   and more nocturnally, thereby reducing predation mortality so more fish
   survived longer. These results indicate that the traditional concept of
   food limitation, that food availability stops limiting population size
   when it exceeds some threshold level, may not be useful and can be
   misleading. Results also strongly contradict the concept that a salmonid
   population is not food limited if the total food supply is greater than
   the population's consumption. Explicit consideration of adaptive
   behaviour produced a novel but believable understanding of food effects
   on salmonid populations. Published 2011. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {{There is ample evidence to suggest that a significant part of daily
   eating behaviours consists of habits. In line with this, the concept of
   habit is increasingly incorporated into studies investigating the
   behavioural and psychosocial determinants of food choice, yielding
   evidence that habit is one of the most powerful predictors of eating
   behaviour. Research shows that habitual behaviour is fundamentally
   different from non-habitual behaviour: when behaviour is habitual,
   people require little information to make decisions, intentions are poor
   predictors of behaviour, and behaviour is triggered by situational cues.
   These insights have vast implications for research in the food domain
   that are only just beginning to be addressed. Also, theorizing on habits
   has important implications for behaviour change interventions, yet few
   interventions that are based on habit theory have been tested in a food
   context. The present article provides an overview of habit research and
   discusses possibilities to increase our knowledge of the role of habits
   in eating behaviour. It is shown that interventions targeting habitual
   behaviour can try to (i) change the situation that triggers the habitual
   behaviour, (ii) promote or inhibit the habitual response and (iii)
   change relevant contingencies. These insights can act as a starting
   point for future intervention research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Individual Differences Model posits that individual differences in
   physiological and psychological factors explain eating behaviors in
   response to stress. The purpose was to determine the effects of
   individual differences in adiposity, dietary restraint and stress
   reactivity on children's energy intake and food choices. A total of 40
   boys and girls, age 8-12 years, with wide ranges of dietary restraint,
   adiposity, and stress reactivity were measured for total energy intake
   and choice of energy dense `comfort' and lower density `healthy' foods
   following reading and speech stressor manipulations. When exploring the
   interaction of dietary restraint and stress reactivity, lower
   restraint/lower reactivity and lower restraint/higher reactivity were
   associated with reductions in energy intake (37-62 kcal) and comfort
   food (33-89 kcal). Higher restraint/lower reactivity was associated with
   consuming 86 fewer total kcal and 45 fewer kcal of comfort food. Only
   higher restraint/higher reactivity predicted increased energy intake
   (104 kcal) and comfort food (131 kcal). The interaction of dietary
   restraint and percentage body fat revealed that lower restraint/lower
   adiposity was associated with consuming 123 fewer kcal after being
   stressed with the entire reduction due to a decrease in comfort food.
   Lower restraint/higher adiposity was associated with consuming 116 kcal
   more after being stressed with 70\% (81 kcal) of the increase in the
   form of comfort foods. Higher restraint/lower adiposity and higher
   restraint/higher adiposity were associated with smaller changes in total
   energy intake of 22 kcal and 1 kcal; respectively. Both restraint and
   adiposity moderated the effect of stress on energy intake and food
   choice. Children with greater adiposity may be at risk for
   stress-induced eating to contribute to their obesity. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Acclimation in the thermal tolerance range of insects occurs when they
   are exposed to novel temperatures in the laboratory. In contrast to the
   large number of studies that have tested for the ability of insects to
   acclimate, relatively few have sought to determine the time-course for
   attainment and reversal of thermal acclimation. In this study the time
   required for the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann,
   and the Natal fruit fly, Ceratitis rosa Karsch, to acclimate to a range
   of constant temperatures was tested by determining the chill-coma
   recovery time and heat knock-down time of flies that had been exposed to
   novel benign temperatures for different durations. The time required for
   reversal of acclimation for both Ceratitis species was also determined
   after flies had been returned to the control temperature. Acclimation to
   31 degrees C for only one day significantly improved the heat knock-down
   time of C capitata, but also led to slower recovery from chill-coma.
   Heat knock-down time indicated that acclimation was achieved after only
   one day in C rosa, but it took three days for C rosa to exhibit a
   significant acclimation response to a novel temperature of 33 degrees C
   when measured using chill-coma recovery time. Reversal of acclimation
   after return to initial temperature conditions was achieved after only
   one day in both C capitata and C. rosa. Adult C capitata held at 31.5
   degrees C initially exhibited improved heat knock-down times but after 9
   days the heat knock-down time of these flies had declined to levels not
   significantly different from that of control flies held at the baseline
   temperature of 24 degrees C. In both Ceratitis species, heat knock-down
   time declined with age whereas chill-coma recovery time increased with
   age, indicating an increased susceptibility to high and low
   temperatures, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates and reviews literature regarding a range of
   topics important to the research question the themes apply across all

   then applied to gain insight into anticounterfeit product/package
   efforts. Based on this research, it appears that there is value for
   brand marketers to enhance their anticounterfeit efforts and consumer
   confidence by utilizing warning labels and information labels on their
   labels or packages. Currently, consumer perception of a domestic
   counterfeit product threat (promoted as genuine products), even for
   pharmaceuticals by healthcare professionals, although increasing has
   still been very low. Generally, the consumers believe and expect that
   the product purchased from retailers is safe and genuine. The study
   reviewed many key warning and label communication areas: consumer
   behaviour review, technical specifications, anticounterfeit, tamper
   evidence/tamper resistance, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol, cigarette,
   nutrition food and nutrition supplements. To complete the insight on
   communicating with the consumer, a review of label legibility was
   included. Before brand marketers consider adding anticounterfeit warning

Abstract = {{Plants have shaped our human life form from the outset. With the
   emerging recognition of world population feeding, global climate change
   and limited energy resources with fossil fuels, the relevance of plant
   biology and biotechnology is becoming dramatically important. One key
   issue is to improve plant productivity and abiotic/biotic stress
   resistance in agriculture due to restricted land area and increasing
   environmental pressures. Another aspect is the development of
   CO2-neutral plant resources for fiber/biomass and biofuels: a transition
   from first generation plants like sugar cane, maize and other important
   nutritional crops to second and third generation energy crops such as
   Miscanthus and trees for lignocellulose and algae for biomass and feed,
   hydrogen and lipid production. At the same time we have to conserve and
   protect natural diversity and species richness as a foundation of our
   life on earth. Here, biodiversity banks are discussed as a foundation of
   current and future plant breeding research. Consequently, it can be
   anticipated that plant biology and ecology will have more indispensable
   future roles in all socio-economic aspects of our life than ever before.
   We therefore need an in-depth understanding of the physiology of single
   plant species for practical applications as well as the translation of
   this knowledge into complex natural as well as anthropogenic ecosystems.
   Latest developments in biological and bioanalytical research will lead
   into a paradigm shift towards trying to understand organisms at a
   systems level and in their ecosystemic context: (i) shotgun and
   next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation,
   (ii) genome-scale molecular analysis using OMICS technologies and (iii)
   computer-assisted analysis, modeling and interpretation of biological
   data. Systems biology combines these molecular data, genetic evolution,
   environmental cues and species interaction with the understanding,
   modeling and prediction of active biochemical networks up to whole
   species populations. This process relies on the development of new
   technologies for the analysis of molecular data, especially genomics,
   metabolomics and proteomics data. The ambitious aim of these
   non-targeted `omic' technologies is to extend our understanding beyond
   the analysis of separated parts of the system, in contrast to
   traditional reductionistic hypothesis-driven approaches. The consequent
   integration of genotyping, pheno/morphotyping and the analysis of the
   molecular phenotype using metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics
   will reveal a novel understanding of plant metabolism and its
   interaction with the environment. The analysis of single model systems -
   plants, fungi, animals and bacteria - will finally emerge in the
   analysis of populations of plants and other organisms and their
   adaptation to the ecological niche. In parallel, this novel
   understanding of ecophysiology will translate into knowledge-based
   approaches in crop plant biotechnology and marker- or genome-assisted
   breeding approaches. In this review the foundations of green systems
   biology are described and applications in ecosystems research are
   presented. Knowledge exchange of ecosystems research and green
   biotechnology merging into green systems biology is anticipated based on
   the principles of natural variation, biodiversity and the
   genotype-phenotype environment relationship as the fundamental drivers
   of ecology and evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lactation is the most energetically expensive component of reproduction

   experimental tests are required, since comparisons of the behaviour of
   naturally reproducing and non-reproducing females cannot distinguish
   between true costs of reproduction, individual differences or seasonal
   variation. We experimentally manipulated reproduction in free-ranging,
   eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), using a fertility control
   agent. Our novel field experiment revealed that females altered their
   behaviour in direct response to the energetic demands of reproduction:
   reproducing females increased bite rates, and thus food intake, when the
   energetic demands of lactation were highest. Reproducing females did not
   reduce the time spent on vigilance for predators, but increased their
   forage intake on faecal-contaminated pasture, thereby increasing the
   risk of infection by gastrointestinal parasites-a largely unrecognized
   potential cost of reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{SIRT1 is a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that governs a number of genetic
   programs to cope with changes in the nutritional status of cells and

   survival of higher animals. Here we used mice with increased or
   decreased brain SIRT1 to show that this sirtuin regulates anxiety and
   exploratory drive by activating transcription of the gene encoding the
   monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) to reduce serotonin levels in the brain.
   Indeed, treating animals with MAO-A inhibitors or selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) normalized anxiety differences between
   wild-type and mutant animals. SIRT1 deacetylates the brain-specific
   helix-loop-helix transcription factor NHLH2 on lysine 49 to increase its
   activation of the MAO-A promoter. Both common and rare variations in the
   SIRT1 gene were shown to be associated with risk of anxiety in human

Abstract = {{Sun protection is recommended for skin cancer prevention, yet little is

   to investigate the relationship between different types of sun

   population.
   Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 5,920 adults aged
   18-60 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   2003-2006. We analyzed questionnaire responses on sun protective
   behaviors: staying in the shade, wearing long sleeves, wearing a hat,
   using sunscreen and SPF level. Analyses were adjusted for multiple
   confounders of 25(OH)D levels and stratified by race. Our primary
   outcome measures were serum 25(OH)D levels (ng/ml) measured by
   radioimmunoassay and vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25(OH)D levels <
   20 ng/ml.
   Staying in the shade and wearing long sleeves were significantly
   associated with lower 25(OH)D levels. Subjects who reported frequent use
   of shade on a sunny day had -3.5 ng/ml (p (trend) < 0.001) lower 25(OH)D
   levels compared to subjects who reported rare use. Subjects who reported
   frequent use of long sleeves had -2.2 ng/ml (p (trend) = 0.001) lower
   25(OH)D levels. These associations were strongest for whites, and did
   not reach statistical significance among Hispanics or blacks. White
   participants who reported frequently staying in the shade or wearing
   long sleeves had double the odds of vitamin D deficiency compared with
   those who rarely did so. Neither wearing a hat nor using sunscreen was
   associated with low 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D deficiency.
   White individuals who protect themselves from the sun by seeking shade
   or wearing long sleeves may have lower 25(OH)D levels and be at risk for
   vitamin D deficiency. Frequent sunscreen use does not appear to be
   linked to vitamin D deficiency in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Classical foraging theory considers behavioural modifications in
   response to changes in the type and array of food available and has, in
   recent years, also considered how foraging behaviour should adjust to
   predation danger. In this chapter we use these ideas to consider how
   well foragers are able to accommodate rapid anthropogenic environmental
   change. We conclude that foraging behaviour is generally able to
   mitigate large changes in the amount and type of prey on offer.
   Predation risk has powerful effects on prey behaviour that can
   profoundly affect the growth of their populations, even if predators do
   not actually kill many prey. Moreover, these effects are passed on to
   other parts of the community. We therefore expect the changing face of
   predation risk on the planet-broadly speaking, the return of top
   predators in terrestrial ecosystems and the disappearance of top
   predators in marine ecosystems-to have important effects.}},

Title = {{Strategies for reversing the effects of metabolic disorders induced as a
   consequence of developmental programming}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Obesity and the metabolic syndrome have reached epidemic proportions
   worldwide with far-reaching health care and economic implications. The
   rapid increase in the prevalence of these disorders suggests that
   environmental and behavioral influences, rather than genetic causes, are
   fueling the epidemic. The developmental origins of health and disease
   hypothesis has highlighted the link between the periconceptual, fetal,
   and early infant phases of life and the subsequent development of
   metabolic disorders in later life. In particular, the impact of poor
   maternal nutrition on susceptibility to later life metabolic disease in
   offspring is now well documented. Several studies have now shown, at
   least in experimental animal models, that some components of the
   metabolic syndrome, induced as a consequence of developmental
   programming, are potentially reversible by nutritional or targeted
   therapeutic interventions during windows of developmental plasticity.
   This review will focus on critical windows of development and possible
   therapeutic avenues that may reduce metabolic and obesogenic risk
   following an adverse early life environment.}},

Abstract = {{Female songbirds are attracted to male song, and song may honestly
   signal male quality. Song is a phenotypic expression of a complex
   learned behavior and therefore could be indicative of other cognitive
   abilities. Stressful conditions during early development are known to
   adversely affect the development of the mammalian and avian brain, and
   recent evidence suggests a positive association between song quality and
   learning ability. However, prior studies have not assessed how
   early-life stress affects both general cognitive functioning and song
   learning. We subjected nestling- and juvenile-caught European starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris) to either an ad libitum or food-restricted diet until
   approximately 90 days of age. As adults, birds' cognitive abilities were
   assessed via spatial foraging and social learning tasks, while
   controlling for the effects of neophobia. Song learning was assessed in
   undirected and directed singing contexts. We found that birds fed the ad
   libitum diet had significantly longer song bouts in both singing
   contexts, made fewer errors in the spatial foraging task, but performed
   worse on the social learning task than food-restricted birds. Overall,
   song performance only correlated with performance on the spatial
   foraging task: Males with longer mean song bouts in the directed singing
   context committed fewer errors. These data suggest that the neural
   structures supporting song and spatial abilities are both affected by
   nutritional stress during development. Female starlings are attracted to
   longer song bouts and may thus use song bout length to infer spatial
   learning abilities of potential mates.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies on a range of animals have identified a bias that
   seems to violate basic principles of rational behavior: A preference is
   shown for feeding options that previously provided food when reserves
   were low, even though another option had been found to give the same
   reward with less delay. The bias presents a challenge to normative
   models of decision making (which only take account of expected rewards
   and the state of the animal at the decision time). To understand the
   behavior, we take a broad ecological perspective and consider how
   valuation mechanisms evolve when the best action depends upon the
   environment being faced. We show that in a changing and uncertain
   environment, state-dependent valuation can be favored by natural
   selection: Individuals should allow their hunger to affect learning for
   future decisions. The valuation mechanism that typically evolves
   produces the kind of behavior seen in standard laboratory tests. By
   providing an insight into why learning should be affected by the state
   of an individual, we provide a basis for understanding psychological
   principles in terms of an animal's ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aims of this pilot study were to determine the
   feasibility of conducting a large-scale study exploring the extent to
   which self-report psychological and behavioral traits associated with
   eating disorders occur during pregnancy, to test the design, and to
   gather preliminary data on the magnitude of the problem. Although eating
   disorders are estimated to affect 5.9\% of women of childbearing age,
   little is known about pregnancy in women who have an undocumented
   history of disordered eating behavior in the United States.
   Understanding and identifying eating disorders is important because
   optimal maternal nutrition contributes to favorable pregnancy and
   neonatal outcomes.
   Methods: In our study using a retrospective descriptive design, a
   convenience sample of 54 postpartum women aged 19 to 43 years
   voluntarily completed a demographic questionnaire and the Eating
   Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) before discharge from the hospital. Medical
   records were reviewed for documented eating disorders.
   Results: Fifteen women (27.8\%) had scores on the EDI-3 indicating that
   they had psychological and behavioral traits associated with eating
   disorders. One (1.85\%) of the 54 participants' medical records listed a
   history of an eating disorder.
   Discussion: Exploration of self-report symptoms associated with eating
   disorders during pregnancy warrants further investigation. Health
   professionals providing care to pregnant women should assess all clients
   for eating disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period,

Abstract = {{Understanding effects of urbanization on biodiversity requires
   integrated assessments of demographic and behavioral responses by
   species, including urban-adapter species. Past research on mammalian
   responses to urbanization has emphasized predators, but prey species
   could respond to additional factors including variation in predation
   risk. We examined spatial heterogeneity in real and perceived risk
   across an urbanization gradient by comparing survival rates, causes of
   mortality, and antipredator behavior of adult woodchucks (Marmota monax
   (L., 1758)) within an agricultural landscape in Illinois from 2007 to
   2009. Survival rates were higher, and effects of urbanization were
   stronger, during the inactive season. Rural woodchucks primarily died
   from predation or costs associated with hibernation, whereas urban
   woodchucks mainly died from vehicle collisions or unknown reasons. Mean
   levels of antipredator behavior were unrelated to urbanization, but
   among-individual variation in vigilance levels increased in urban areas,
   which may reflect increased spatial variation in disturbance levels
   within urban environments. Distances from burrows while foraging and
   flight initiation distances also were unrelated to urbanization,
   suggesting that urban woodchucks were not strongly habituated to humans.
   Our research provides insights into demographic and behavioral responses
   to urbanization, and constraints to responses, by an urban-adapter

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{108-115}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Many prey organisms exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in
   life-history traits that facilitate a better chance of survival in the
   presence of predators. The evolution of such plastic traits requires
   that the defensive phenotype incurs a cost in the absence of predation.
   2. Model systems that are used to examine predator-induced defences are
   often organisms with complex life histories that only induce defences
   during the larval stage. While many studies have detected costs of
   inducible defences during the larval stage, detecting the costs of
   larval defences after metamorphosis is also important.
   3. We examine the benefits and costs of inducible larval defences in the
   urban mosquito, Aedes notoscriptus, by rearing them in the presence and
   absence of predation cues. We compared survival of larvae inducing
   behavioural defences, when exposed to predation cues, in predation
   trials with predatory fish Hypseleotris galii to that of larvae reared
   in the absence predation cues. We also compared life-history traits of
   predator-exposed larvae to larvae reared in control conditions.
   4. Larvae exposed to chemical predation cues limited activity and were
   able to avoid predation for longer in trials with H. galii. However,
   predator-exposed larvae suffered retarded larval growth and development,
   were smaller at metamorphosis and less resistant to starvation as
   adults.
   5. While it is difficult to understand the `fitness costs' that poorer
   starvation resistance might confer to adult mosquitoes, it is likely
   that smaller adult size of predator-exposed individuals would reduce
   fitness, particularly for females where body size limits the size of
   blood meal they could take to facilitate egg production. We suggest that
   the demonstrable costs of inducible defences in mosquito larvae make
   this a good system for testing theoretical models for the evolutionary
   maintenance of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication-induced changes to benthic faunal activities are problems
   of significant ecological impact, affecting global nutrient budgets as
   well as local trophic connections. We address the question of how
   nitrogen loads to estuarine embayments alter the bioturbation activities
   of benthic fauna. Specifically, we related local benthic activities to
   calculated local nitrogen concentrations for 22 northeastern US
   estuaries. These local nitrogen concentrations were derived from the
   calculated nitrogen loading for the embayment together with the spatial
   distribution of the local flushing time. Our results showed a maximum
   bioturbation rate at intermediate nitrogen concentrations or a
   ``hump-shaped{''} pattern of response. This behavior was evident in all
   embayments that had a range of concentrations including low,
   intermediate, and high values. Embayments where sampling did not include
   this full range did not show this behavior. This work provides methods
   and guidance to help managers make decisions concerning the effects of
   nitrogen loading on the activities and wellbeing of benthic fauna in
   coastal embayments. The novelty of this approach lies in identifying the
   response of bioturbation to nitrogen loading in many systems, without
   costly and time-consuming speciation of benthic fauna, and also in
   rapidly identifying embayments and aquatic areas with vulnerable fauna.
   These results are ecologically significant in supporting the hypothesis
   that benthic organism abundance and activity will peak at mid-levels of
   nitrogen due to the interplay of food availability and oxygen levels,
   noting that the critical levels of these factors differ among water
   bodies.}},

Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{The trade-off between predation risk and the need to feed is one of the
   major constraints animals have to cope with. Virtually all animals have
   a higher risk of being preyed upon when being active (e.g., searching
   for food or mating partners), compared with being inactive (e.g.,
   staying at their burrows, nests, etc.). Yet, staying safe leads to a
   higher risk of starvation and may reduce reproductive success and body
   growth. Hence selection on behaviour optimizing the search, handling and
   digestion of food while avoiding the risk of predation is strong and
   should lead to strategies maximising survival chances and inclusive
   fitness. These facts call for integrative studies manipulating both,
   abundance of food and predation risk in a factorial set up, analysing
   the effects of both factors on behaviour and physiological parameters.
   We present results of a 2 x 2 factorial experiment, manipulating risk of
   predation and food abundance in guppies. We found that the two factors
   have an additive effect on body growth, but that predation risk by a
   pike cichlid is the main factor affecting the expression of behavioural
   strategies in guppies. Low food availability and high predation risk led
   to lower body growth. High predation risk affected swimming depth and
   risk sensitivity of guppies and might represent adaptive behavioural
   changes to the environmental context experienced in early life. Our
   study shows that integrative studies, analysing multiple interdependent
   and interconnected factors in the wild and in the lab are needed to
   further understand animal behaviour and development.}},

   evaluate the effects of physical training during pregnancy on body
   weight gain, waist circumference, glycaemia and cholesterolemia in adult
   offspring submitted to perinatal undernutrition. Female Wistar rats (n =
   12) were divided into four groups: control (C, n = 3), trained (T, n =
   3), undernourished (U, n = 3) undernourished and trained (T+U, n = 3).
   During gestation and lactation, U and T+U groups were fed a low protein
   diet (8\% casein) and C and T groups fed a normal protein diet (17\%
   casein). The protocol of moderate physical training was performed on a
   treadmill (5 days/week, 60 min/day, at 65\% of VO2max) and began 4 weeks

   were reduced (5 days/week, 20 min/day, at 30\% VO2max) until the 19th

Abstract = {{Stone martens (Martes foina) are documented as generalist throughout
   their distributional range whose diet composition is affected by food
   availability. We tested if this occurs and what feeding strategies it
   follows in a typical Mediterranean ecosystem in Central Greece by
   analysing contents from 106 stomachs, seasonally collected from three
   different habitats during 2003-2006. Seasonal variation in diet and
   feeding strategies was evident and linked to seasonal nutritional
   requirements, but possibly imposed by strong interference competition
   and intraguild predation. Fleshy fruits and arthropods predominated in
   the diet, but also mammals and birds were frequently consumed. An
   overall low dietary niche breadth (B-A = 0.128) indicated a fruit
   specialization tendency. A generalised diet occurred in spring with high
   individual specialisation, whereas more animal-type prey was consumed
   than fruits. A population specialization towards fruits was indicated
   during summer and autumn, whereas insects were consumed occasionally by
   males. In those seasons it switched to more clumped food types such as
   fruits and insects. In winter it selectively exploited both adult and
   larvae insects and partially fruits overwinter on plants. The tendency
   to consume particular prey items seasonally reflected both the
   population specialist behaviour and the individual flexibility preyed on
   different food resources.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{301-310}},
Abstract = {{Context. Anthropogenic disturbances induce physiological and behavioural
   responses in numerous species. The negative effects of human disturbance
   are of special concern to threatened and endangered species.
   Aims. The present study aims to compare physiological stress measures
   and reproductive success of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens)
   living near roads with jays that live away from roads. Specifically, it
   aims to test whether roads are stressful.
   Methods. We assessed physiological measures that can serve as indicators
   of `stress' to determine whether a highway that bisects our study site
   had physiological effects on adult male Florida scrub-jays. We captured
   male breeders from three territory types, including scrub habitat that
   (1) bordered a highway with a grassy shoulder that created an `edge'
   habitat (roadside), (2) bordered human-maintained habitat (a plowed
   firebreak of sand with adjacent pasture) that served as a control for
   the edge-effect of the road (pasture) and (3) contained only natural
   scrub habitat (interior). We measured baseline concentrations of the
   stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), body mass, and a suite of
   longitudinal body measures to generate a body condition index in males
   from each territory type over three breeding seasons.
   Key results. Roadside jays had greater body mass than did interior and
   pasture jays, although there were no differences in overall baseline
   CORT concentrations or body condition among territory classes. There was
   no difference in clutch initiation date or size and nestling and
   independent-young survival.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that the road through our study site
   has physiological effects on Florida scrub-jays; however, there is mixed
   evidence as to whether it acts as a chronic stressor.
   Implications. Our findings provide evidence that roads and
   road-associated disturbance has neutral or potentially beneficial
   physiological effects of roads on Florida scrub-jays. Knowledge of these
   effects of roads and disturbance on jays will hopefully provide
   additional opportunities to improve conservation of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Seabirds are central place foragers during the breeding season and, as
   marine food resources are often patchily distributed, flexibility in
   foraging behaviour may be important in maintaining prey delivery rates
   to chicks. We developed a methodological approach using a combination of
   GPS data loggers and temperature-depth recorders that allowed us to
   describe the behaviour of surface-feeding seabirds. Specifically, we
   tested whether differences in foraging behaviour of black-legged
   kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla could be linked with reproductive success by
   comparing 2 consecutive years at 2 sites. At Rathlin Island (Northern
   Ireland) during 2010, foraging differed markedly from that during 2009
   and from that at Lambay Island (Republic of Ireland) during both years.
   Birds exhibited foraging trips of greater duration, travelled a greater
   total distance, spent more time in transit and spent longer recuperating
   on the surface of the water. This notable shift was associated with a
   decline in breeding success, with greater loss of eggs to predation and
   lower prey delivery rates, resulting in the starvation of 15\% of
   chicks. We suggest that food resources were reduced or geographically
   less accessible during 2010, with suitable foraging areas located
   further from the colony. Birds did not invest greater amounts of time
   attempting to catch prey. Thus, our results indicate that kittiwakes at
   Rathlin modulated their foraging behaviour not by increasing foraging
   effort through feeding more intensively within prey patches but by
   extending their range to increase the probability of encountering more
   profitable prey patches.}},

Abstract = {{In south east England climate change is predicted to include decreases
   in periodicity of rainfall events during summer, resulting in more,
   longer periods of drought. In many temperate regions these changes will
   affect foraging strategies of soil animals, including arthropod
   macro-decomposers such as terrestrial isopods. We investigated activity
   budgets under drier (50\%) and moisture (90\%) relative humidity
   conditions, for three species: Porcellio scaber, Oniscus asellus and
   Armadillidium vulgare, representing three families, which have different
   morphological adaptations to the terrestrial environment. In the drier
   environment all three species spent more time sheltering, less time
   feeding and less time in other activities. Costs of foraging were
   estimated by monitoring loss of body mass for 7 h. This loss was twice
   as high under the lower humidity regime. On the basis of morphological
   traits, two members of the Oniscidae: O. asellus and Philoscia muscorum,
   differing in eco-morphological strategies, were predicted to be more
   susceptible to desiccation than members of the Porcellionidae or
   Amadillidiidae. Members of the Oniscidae lost mass most quickly and also
   suffered higher mortality in the drier atmosphere. A cost of spending
   more time sheltering was that consumption of high quality food by
   Porcellio scaber was significantly reduced in the drier environment. The
   trade-off between energy gain by feeding and increased probability of
   survivorship by sheltering, is illustrated using an isopleth model.
   Changes in the extent to which the soil fauna will stimulate microbial

Abstract = {{Oviposition behaviour is recognized as an ecologically significant trait
   in insects. Since herbivorous insect females have a potential to lay
   eggs on unsuitable host species, it is hypothesized that this behaviour
   may be the first step in host-range expansion. The most intriguing
   phenomenon, found in some insect species, is the ability of females to
   lay eggs on unsuitable places if hosts are unavailable; this behaviour
   is termed `egg-dumping: Egg-dumping can be adaptive plastic response in
   environments where hosts, either preferred or less suitable, may
   eventually become available. Transgenerational effects of this behaviour
   presume changes in larval feeding experience on different host species.
   Also, diverse larval experience may induce alterations in oviposition
   behaviour. To test whether egg laying behaviour of adult females can be
   modified by larval experience, we performed the experiment on two
   laboratory populations of Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say). First
   population (P) is housed in the laboratory on the common bean for 200
   generations, whereas the second population (C) is derived from the first
   but has been raised for 197 generations on chickpea, a novel and less
   suitable host for larval development. In order to analyze differences
   between short-term and long-term effects of larval experience on
   egg-dumping, both populations have been exposed to each host seed for
   one generation. The results of the study show that females from P
   population lay eggs more frequently in the absence of seeds when
   developed on chickpeas, compared with P females reared on beans. By
   contrast to P females, in C population, larval experience has no
   significant effects either on the number of dumped eggs or on the
   frequency of dumper females. These results demonstrate a significant
   inter-population diversification of phenotypic plasticity in egg-dumping
   behaviour depending on larval host experience. In other words,
   modification of oviposition behaviour, as a consequence of a long-term
   larval nutritional stress, can evoke previously unrecognized
   transgenerational effects.}},

   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a
   multiple-stratified random sampling method based on the Korea Census of
   2007. In October 2009, investigators conducted 15-minute face-to-face

Abstract = {{Defining the ecological impacts conferred by invasive fishes provides a
   framework for evaluating the feasibility of control efforts in invaded
   waterways, and for predicting the consequences of future incursions.
   Eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) is a remarkably successful invader
   of freshwater systems worldwide, with the capacity to detrimentally
   impact native fishes both directly (e.g. competition, predation,
   agonistic interactions) and indirectly (e.g. triggering trophic
   cascades). Here, we modelled the influence of eastern gambusia and
   several environmental covariates on fish species diversity, abundance
   and condition based on quantitative survey data collected from 93
   wetlands in south-eastern Australia. We predicted that small-bodied,
   wetland specialist species sharing dietary-and habitat-niches with
   eastern gambusia would be most severely impacted, and that environmental
   stressors associated with wetland drying during late summer would
   magnify these impacts. Eastern gambusia influenced the occurrence,
   abundance and/or body condition of most common wetland species; however,
   the direction and level of impact appeared dependent on both biotic and
   environmental forces. From these results, we postulate that generalist
   life-history strategies that permit niche-segregation may release some
   native species from competitive/predatory pressures, allowing
   coexistence with eastern gambusia in resource-limited, environmentally
   harsh habitats, whilst specialist species that occupy narrower

Abstract = {{Social experiences can have a persistent effect on biological processes
   leading to phenotypic diversity. Variation in gene regulation has
   emerged as a mechanism through which the interplay between DNA and
   environments leads to the biological encoding of these experiences.
   Epigenetic modifications-molecular pathways through which transcription
   is altered without altering the underlying DNA sequence-play a critical
   role in the normal process of development and are being increasingly
   explored as a mechanism linking environmental experiences to long-term
   biobehavioral outcomes. In this review, evidence implicating epigenetic
   factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, in the link
   between social experiences occurring during the postnatal period and in
   adulthood and altered neuroendocrine and behavioral outcomes will be
   highlighted. In addition, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping
   variation in social behavior and the implications of epigenetics for our
   understanding of the transmission of traits across generations will be
   discussed. (C) 2012, Elsevier Inc.
   Though our DNA sequence provides a template for generating individual
   differences and for the transmission of those characteristics across
   generations, it is evident that the environment contributes
   significantly to both of these processes. The dichotomy between the
   influences of nature (DNA) and nurture (environment) has become part of
   our theoretical framework for understanding the origins of our unique
   characteristics-ranging from personality to disease risk. However,
   advances in molecular biology have provided enlightenment regarding both
   the relationship between genotype and phenotype and the mechanisms
   through which environment shapes biological processes, and the insights
   gained from these advances has challenged the nature versus nurture
   dichotomy. It is becoming increasingly apparent that development is a
   process of dynamic interplay between the genome and our environmental
   experiences. This interplay is perhaps best illustrated in the concept
   of epigenetics-the study of those factors which alter the activity of
   genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. There is increasing
   evidence that environmental experiences can come to shape the activity
   of genes through epigenetic pathways and thus the genotype to phenotype
   and environment to phenotype relationships may ultimately be governed by
   similar molecular processes.
   The investigation of environmentally induced epigenetic effects has
   highlighted the impact of a wide variety of environmental exposures,
   including nutritional levels during development, toxins, and both early
   and later life stressors (Champagne, 2010; Jirtle and Skinner, 2007).
   However, it is perhaps the interplay between social experiences and the
   genome which demonstrates most profoundly how nature and nurture
   interact. Across a variety of species, there is evidence for the effect
   of social experiences occurring across the lifespan on epigenetic
   pathways leading to broad phenotypic effects, including stress
   responsivity, learning/memory, and reproductive behavior (Champagne,
   2010). Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms may account for the emergence of
   social experiences through the effects of these molecular modifications
   on social behavior (Auger et al., 2011; Kataoka et al., 2011).
   Ultimately, these interactive effects can lead to the transgenerational
   continuity of individual differences in neurobiological and behavioral
   characteristics (Champagne, 2008). In this chapter, evidence for the
   epigenetic consequence of social experiences, such as mother-infant
   interactions and adult social interactions, will be highlighted followed
   by a discussion of the epigenetic basis of variation in social behavior.
   This research contributes to our understanding of the inheritance of
   behavior and raises challenging questions regarding future directions in
   the study of behavioral epigenetics.}},

   Beneficial effects of dietary energy restriction (DER) and exercise on

   particular, BDNF signaling mediates adaptive responses of the central,

Abstract = {{Genetic variation for plastic phenotypes potentially contributes

   variation across the full range of ecologically relevant copper
   concentrations, from starvation to toxicity, and 2) to test the
   hypothesis that plastic networks exhibit increased population variation
   for gene expression. We find that although the vast majority of the
   variation is small in magnitude (considerably <2-fold), not just some,
   but most genes demonstrate variable expression across environments,
   across genetic backgrounds, or both. Plastically expressed genes
   included both genes regulated directly by copper-binding transcription

Abstract = {{Survival strategies and cost-benefit-balances of the predatory insect
   larva (Euroleon nostras FOURCROY, Myrmeleontidae)
   We are investigating the behavior strategies and the evolutionary
   adaptations and we are also determining the quantitative parameters for
   cost-benefit-balance in the antlions Euroleon nostras, Myrmeleon
   formicarius and M bore. Antlions live in sand mostly in deserts and
   semideserts or in zones of glacial origin and in coastal dunes. The
   probability of prey capture is increased to about 200 species as they
   construct pit. However: larvae that construct traps remain essentially
   inactive at the ambush-site and wait for active prey.
   Larvae of E. nostras need a very short time (approximately 25 min) for
   constructing a pitfall trap in relation to the time at resting metabolic
   rate. Therefore, the costs of the pit construction (volume, mass weight,
   energy) are of minor importance in relation to prey. The linear
   accession of pit traps diameter (benefit of prey catch) exponentially
   corresponds to ascent of costs. Although ants live in aggregations and
   use paths, the capture rate of an antlion remains very low, because prey
   is arriving seldom and in unpredictable intervals. In one of the survey
   habitats with 48 pits the antlions captured only 17 prey in 4 days. Each
   pit results in a capture rate of 1 prey/11.3 d. Capturing rates of 1
   prey/3.3 d and 1 prey/24.0 d respectively were reported for 2 other
   areas at the same time.
   The body masses of the first, second and third larval stages varied from
   39 to 50\% of the means (2.71 +/- 1.22 mg, n = 34; 15.20 +/- 7.57 mg, n
   = 34; 57.9 +/- 22.22 mg, n = 29). For all the larvae instars the mean
   extraction rate of living mass of an ant was 55 to 70\% of the live
   weight. The surviving of hunger periods up to more then 4 months of the
   first and second larval instars and up to 8 months in case of the third
   instar is part of evolution-conditioned adjustments. An antlion pit is
   built within 25 min activity time. The function time of the pit was
   about 23:35 h within a 24 h-day before beginning of a pit enlargement
   activity phase.
   The pit construction requires minimum energetic costs, whereas the gain
   obtained by capturing a prey amounts to 20500 mJ per single prey. The
   calculation is based on the energy content of investigated food and the
   carbon content of the prey Formica spec. Our results indicate that an
   antlion with a wet weight (ww) of 22.6 mg releases 0.62 mu g C{*}h(-1)
   (1.3 J{*}g(-1) ww {*}h(-1)) within periods of inactivity and 5.28 mu g
   C{*}h(-1) (11.6 J{*}g(-1) ww{*}h(-1)) during construction of a pit (rest
   : activity 1:8,5). Considering an estimated extraction efficiency of
   36.5\% at feeding on Formica, one prey of this kind compensates the loss
   of carbon or energy originated by the resting metabolic rate of the
   larvae for 25 days.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The BeWEL study is aimed at assessing the impact of a
   personalised lifestyle programme on body weight in people at risk of
   developing colorectal adenomas. The study is a two-arm multicentre
   randomised controlled trial comparing the BeWEL lifestyle programme

   adenoma removed through the national screening programme will be
   randomised to provide 80\% power to detect a weight loss (primary
   outcome) of 7\% over 12 months.
   Methods: The 12-month intervention will be delivered by lifestyle
   counsellors via three face-to-face visits followed by nine monthly
   telephone support calls. Consultant endorsement for the study will be
   stressed. An individualised caloric prescription based on estimates for
   weight maintenance -600 kcal will be calculated. Motivational
   interviewing techniques will be used to identify personal motivations
   for weight change and ways to improve perceived self-efficacy. The
   programme will utilise personalised diet and physical activity data from

Title = {{Fats and Factors: Lipid Profiles Associate with Personality Factors and
   Suicidal History in Bipolar Subjects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have shown efficacy in the treatment
   of bipolar disorder, however their specific role in treating the illness
   is unclear. Serum PUFA and dietary intakes of PUFA associate with
   suicidal behavior in epidemiological studies. The objective of this
   study was to assess serum n-3 and n-6 PUFA levels in bipolar subjects
   and determine possible associations with suicidal risk, including
   suicidal history and relevant personality factors that have been
   associated with suicidality. We studied 27 bipolar subjects using the
   NEO-PI to assess the big five personality factors, structured interviews
   to verify diagnosis and assess suicidal history, and lipomics to
   quantify n-3 and n-6 PUFA in serum. We found positive associations
   between personality factors and ratios of n-3 PUFA, suggesting that
   conversion of short chain to long chain n-3s and the activity of enzymes
   in this pathway may associate with measures of personality. Thus, ratios
   of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and the
   activity of fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) involved in the conversion
   of ALA to DHA were positively associated with openness factor scores.
   Ratios of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to ALA and ratios of EPA to DHA
   were positively associated with agreeableness factor scores. Finally,
   serum concentrations of the n-6, arachidonic acid (AA), were
   significantly lower in subjects with a history of suicide attempt
   compared to non-attempters. The data suggest that specific lipid
   profiles, which are controlled by an interaction between diet and
   genetics, correlate with suicidal history and personality factors
   related to suicidal risk. This study provides preliminary data for
   future studies to determine whether manipulation of PUFA profiles
   (through diet or supplementation) can affect personality measures and
   disease outcome in bipolar subjects and supports the need for further
   investigations into individualized specific modulations of lipid
   profiles to add adjunctive value to treatment paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Functional disturbances within cortico-striatal control systems have
   been implicated in the psychobiology (i.e. impaired cognitive-behavioral
   flexibility, perfectionist personality) of anorexia nervosa. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate the morphometry of brain regions
   within cortico-striatal networks in acute anorexia nervosa (AN) as well
   as long-term weight-restored anorexia nervosa (AN-WR) patients. A total
   of 39 participants: 12 AN, 13 AN-WR patients, and 14 healthy controls
   (HC) underwent high-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), a cognitive-behavioral flexibility task, and a psychometric
   assessment. Group differences in local grey matter volume (GMV) were
   analyzed using whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and brain-atlas
   based automatic volumetry computation (IBASPM). Individual differences
   in total GMV were considered as a covariate in all analyses.
   In the regional brain morphometry, AN patients, as compared to HC,
   showed decreased GMVs (VBM and volumetry) in the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), and in subcortical
   regions (amygdala, putamen: VBM only). AN-WR compared to HC showed
   decreased GMV (VBM and volumetry) in the ACC and SMA, whereas GMV of the
   subcortical region showed no differences. The findings of the study
   suggest that structural abnormalities of the ACC and SMA were
   independent of the disease stage, whereas subcortical limbic-striatal
   changes were state dependent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The dual intervention point model states that body mass is controlled by
   upper and lower intervention points, above and below which animals (and
   humans) intervene physiologically to bring their body mass back into the
   acceptable range. It has been further suggested that the lower
   intervention point may be defined by the risk of starvation, while the
   upper intervention point may be defined by the risk of predation. The
   objective of the present study was to test whether the risk of
   starvation determines the lower intervention point and to examine the
   physiological and behavioral mechanisms that underpin the regulation of
   body mass, when the risk of starvation is increased. Sixty-four mice
   were exposed to random days of complete fasting or 50\% food restriction
   and their body mass and fat mass responses were measured. Food intake,
   physical activity and body temperature were measured throughout the
   experiment. In addition, plasma leptin and insulin, triglyceride and
   non-esterified fatty acids, along with hypothalamic neuropeptides gene
   expression in the arcuate nucleus were assessed after 13 and 42 days of
   treatment. We found that C57BL/6J mice increased body mass and fatness
   in response to a short-term (13 days) intermittent fasting, which was
   restored to baseline as the treatment was prolonged. In contrast,
   intermittently 50\% food restricted mice showed no significant changes
   in body mass or fatness. Over the first 13 days of treatment the data
   were consistent with the dual intervention point model as the mice
   showed both increased body mass and adiposity over this period. Over the
   more protracted period of 42 days the effect waned and was therefore
   inconsistent with the model. The body mass and fat mass gains in
   intermittently fasted mice were mainly accounted for by increased food
   intake. Elevated NPY gene expression after 13 days (three 24 h fasting
   events) may have driven the increase in food intake. However, no changes
   were observed in such neuropeptides as POMC, CART, AgRP, Ob-Rb and SOCS
   3 or circulating levels of leptin, insulin. NEFA and TG. Hypothermia
   during fasting days may have also contributed to the increase in body
   mass. Over 42 days of treatment (nine 24 h fasting events) cumulative
   food intake was not affected by intermittent starvation. However
   physical activity, mainly activity during the light phase was lowered
   suggesting an adaptation to unpredictable starvation. Overall, mice
   exhibited different behavioral and physiological responses to
   intermittent starvation depending on the duration of treatment. (C) 2011

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{93-101}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Compensatory growth, or catch-up growth, occurs when an organism grows
   faster than the optimal rate after a period of growth restriction. The
   evolved optimal growth rate maximizes an animal's fitness potential
   while preserving tissue quality. Rapid compensatory growth allows the
   organism to achieve an adult size closer to that of an unrestricted
   conspecific. However, this accelerated growth may come at the cost of
   impaired fitness later in life due to accumulated cellular damage.
   Amphibians are an interesting, yet neglected, group in which to observe
   the effects of compensatory growth because of their flexible life
   history and the importance of large size for reproductive fitness. We
   investigated the effects of early nutritional restriction on the growth,
   morphology and three fitness-related behavioural traits of brown tree
   frog tadpoles Litoria ewingii before and after metamorphosis. Tadpoles
   were fed reduced rations for two weeks, c. 35\% of the control group's
   larval period, before being returned to the diet of the controls. The
   dietary treatment caused a significant difference in pre- and
   post-metamorphic survival between the groups. The tadpoles on the
   restricted diet exhibited faster weight gain upon refeeding and reached
   a final size significantly larger than the control tadpoles. However,
   the larval period of the restricted group was extended by c. 5 days,
   compared with the control group. Early nutritional restriction also
   negatively affected the pre-metamorphic fitness-related behavioural
   trait of swimming speed. The restricted group showed an unexpected
   advantage in both post-metamorphic fitness-related behavioural traits of
   feeding latency and hopping ability. These results contrast with
   previous work on compensatory growth in tadpoles because nutritional
   restriction affected the developmental rate and also resulted in
   over-compensation of growth. Our experiment provides support for the
   prevalence of compensatory growth in diverse taxa and a unique
   observation of the post-metamorphic consequences in amphibians adapted
   to ephemeral environments.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has suggested that vegetarianism may serve as a mask

   semi-vegetarians; those who restricted only red meat from their diet,

   significantly more restrained than omnivores. Whereas food choices of
   semi-vegetarians and flexitarians were motivated by weight control,
   vegetarians and pesco-vegetarians' food choices were motivated by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{413}},
Pages = {{192-197}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The currently rising sea temperatures are expected to affect the
   structure of aquatic communities. Through increased metabolic rates,
   activity and feeding motivation, higher temperature can be expected to
   add to competition and predation risk for many small fish and juveniles.
   However, behavioural flexibility e.g. individual variation in the
   expression of behavioural traits may act to buffer the detrimental
   effects of increased temperature. In the present study we ask how
   juvenile Atlantic cod respond to food availability and predation risk at
   the limits of their current natural temperature at the Icelandic coast
   (3 degrees C-13 degrees C). At 13 degrees C Atlantic cod juveniles
   responded less to risk, remaining active, dispersed and leaving shelter
   positions earlier. However, at the same time their feeding attempts
   reduce significantly and correspondingly to the lower temperature.
   Therefore, our results suggest that at 13 degrees C Atlantic cod
   juveniles do not adjust their behaviour to manage the increased feeding
   motivation while under risk. However, we do find evidence for individual
   variation in how behaviour is expressed across treatments indicating
   natural variation that could respond to selection. In conclusion, our
   results suggest that increased sea temperature could have both immediate
   negative effects on survival and initiate a selective response in
   Atlantic cod populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Models explaining behavioural syndromes often focus on state-dependency,
   linking behavioural variation to individual differences in other
   phenotypic features. Empirical studies are, however, rare. Here, we
   tested for a size and growth-dependent stable behavioural syndrome in
   the juvenile-stages of a solitary apex predator ( pike, Esox lucius),
   shown as repeatable foraging behaviour across risk. Pike swimming
   activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful
   prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact
   with a competitor or predator. Foraging behaviour across risks was
   considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary
   predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat
   avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural
   syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour
   between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation.
   However, individual behaviour was independent of body size and growth in
   conditions of high food availability, showing no evidence to support the
   state-dependent personality hypothesis. The importance of a combination

Abstract = {{Voluntary wheel running (WR) is a form of physical activity in rodents
   that influences ingestive behavior. The present report describes an
   anorexic behavior triggered by the simultaneous introduction of a novel
   diet and WR. This study examined the sequential, compared with the
   simultaneous, introduction of a novel high-fat (HF) diet and voluntary
   WR in rats of three different ages and revealed a surprising finding;
   the simultaneous introduction of HF food and voluntary WR induced a
   behavior in which the animals chose not to eat although food was
   available at all times. This phenomenon was apparently not due to an
   aversion to the novel HF diet because introduction of the running wheels
   plus the HF diet, while continuing the availability of the normal chow
   diet did not prevent the anorexia. Moreover, the anorexia was prevented
   with prior exposure to the HF diet. In addition, the anorexia was not
   related to extent of WR but dependent on the act of WR. The introduction
   a HF diet and locked running wheels did not induce the anorexia. This
   voluntary anorexia was accompanied by substantial weight loss, and the
   anorexia was rapidly reversed by removal of the running wheels.
   Moreover, the HF/WR-induced anorexia is preserved across the age span
   despite the intrinsic decrease in WR activity and increased consumption
   of HF food with advancing age. The described phenomenon provides a new
   model to investigate anorexia behavior in rodents. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Despite the spread of human-impacted wildlife habitats, few studies have
   examined how animals adapt their socioecology in agriculturaleforest
   ecotones. Anthropogenic processes such as agricultural development
   directly affect the ecological challenges that species face. In
   agriculturaleforest ecotones cultivated foods that are palatable,
   energy-rich, easily digestible, and that often occur as large, clumped
   and spatially abundant orchards or fields may offer foraging advantages
   over natural foods. However, crop raiding can be risky: harassment,
   injury or even death may arise from confrontations with people. The
   factors that affect grouping decisions and activity budgets within
   anthropogenic environments are unknown. Twelve months of focal data were
   collected from direct observations of one chimpanzee community
   inhabiting a forestefarm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea. Wild fruit abundance
   did not directly influence daily party size. Instead, cultivated
   resource consumption, in combination with other social factors, provided
   chimpanzees with an alternative to fissioning. Chimpanzee party size did
   not differ between crop raids and wild feeds, but party cohesiveness did
   increase during raids. Furthermore, males and females adapted their
   activity budgets in different ways to integrate cultivated resources
   into their broader ecological strategy. As species are increasingly
   forced into anthropogenically impacted habitats, models of
   fissionefusion dynamics and other socioecological adaptations need to
   take into account exploitation of cultivated, energy-rich crops. (C)

Abstract = {{1. Despite the popular use of diffusion models to predict the spatial
   spread of populations over time, we currently know little about how
   diffusion rates change with the state of the environment or the internal
   condition of individuals. To address this gap in our understanding, we
   measured rates of spread for many populations of the rotifer Brachionus
   calyciflorus in a suite of well-replicated experiments.
   2. In one set of experiments, we manipulated food availability and
   population density along a continuous range of densities. In a second
   set, we manipulated the internal state of entire populations via food
   deprivation and exposure to predator kairomones.
   3. Across replicate populations, diffusion rates were positively
   correlated with conspecific density. Diffusion rates were negatively
   correlated with food availability, especially when conspecific density
   was high. Diffusion rates of food-deprived populations or those exposed
   to predation risk were lower than controls.
   4. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that rates of
   population spread are conditional on population density, food
   availability, body condition and predation risk.}},

Title = {{Fluctuations in population composition dampen the impact of phenotypic
   plasticity on trait dynamics in superb fairy-wrens}},

Abstract = {{1. In structured populations, phenotypic change can result from changes
   throughout an individuals lifetime (phenotypic plasticity, age-related
   changes), selection and changes in population composition (environment-
   or density-driven fluctuations in age-structure).
   2. The contribution of population dynamics to phenotypic change has
   often been ignored. However, for understanding trait dynamics, it is
   important to identify both the individual- and population-level
   mechanisms responsible for trait change, because they potentially
   reinforce or counteract each other.
   3. We use 22 years of field data to investigate the dynamics of a
   sexually selected phenological trait, the timing of nuptial moult in
   superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus.
   4. We show that trait expression is both climate-and age-dependent, but
   that phenotypic plasticity in response to climate variability also
   varies with age. Old males can acquire nuptial plumage very early after
   high rainfall, but 1- to 2-year-olds cannot. However, males of all ages
   that defer moult to later in the year acquire nuptial plumage earlier
   when conditions are warmer.
   5. The underlying mechanism appears to be that old males may risk
   moulting in the most challenging period of the year: in autumn, when
   drought restricts food abundance and during the cold winter. By
   contrast, young males always moult during the spring transition to
   benign - warmer and generally wetter - conditions. Temperature changes
   dominate this transition that heralds the breeding season, thereby
   causing both young and late-moulting older birds to be temperature
   sensitive.
   6. Climate and age also affect trait dynamics via a population dynamical
   pathway. The same high rainfall that triggers early moulting in old
   males concurrently increases offspring recruitment and thereby reduces
   the average age of males in the population. Consequently, effects of
   rainfall on trait dynamics through phenotypic plasticity of old males
   are dampened by synchronous rejuvenation of the age-structure.
   7. A long-term trend towards drier environments prompted phenotypic
   change because of plasticity, but this was masked by climate-driven
   demographic change (causing apparent stasis). This suggests a novel
   explanation for why trait change may fail to reflect the observed
   pattern of directional selection or phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a
   ``shyness-boldness{''} continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take
   risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known
   about how this personality trait might influence individual predation
   risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk
   management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by
   observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals.
   These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect
   to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed
   effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS
   had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately
   repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for
   a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant
   correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior.
   Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of
   the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity,
   suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute
   a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation
   dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability
   in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that
   determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these
   baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility
   when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context,
   potentially removing these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual traits are especially sensitive to low food resources. Other
   environmental parameters (e.g., predation) should also affect sexual
   trait expression by favoring investment in viability traits rather than
   sexual traits. We know surprisingly little about how predators alter
   investment in sexual traits, or how predator and resource environments
   interact to affect sexual trait investment. We explored how increasing
   phosphorous (P) availability, at a level mimicking cultural
   eutrophication, affects the development of sexual, nonsexual, and
   viability traits of amphipods in the presence and absence of predators.
   Sexual traits and growth were hypersensitive to low P compared to
   nonsexual traits. However, a key sexual trait responded to low P only
   when predator cues were absent. Furthermore, investment trade-offs
   between sexual traits and growth only occurred when P was low. The
   phenotypic changes caused by predator cues and increased P availability
   resulted in higher male mating success. Thus, eutrophication not only
   affects sexual trait expression but also masks the trade-off between
   traits with similar P demand. Sensitivity of sexually selected traits to
   changes in P, combined with the important roles these traits play in
   determining fitness and driving speciation, suggests that human-induced
   environmental change can greatly alter the evolutionary trajectories of
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common
   worldwide and cause considerable social and economic burden. The aims of
   SEPAHAN project were to 1) assess the prevalence of different FGIDs
   within an Iranian population, 2) investigate the relationship of FGIDs
   and their symptoms with lifestyle and nutritional factors, and 3)
   investigate the relationship of FGIDs and their symptoms with
   psychological factors. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study among
   staff of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Sciences
   (Isfahan, Iran) and consisted of two main phases. In the first phase, a
   detailed dietary questionnaire was used to assess dietary habits and
   usual dietary intakes. Other lifestyle factors were investigated using
   appropriate questionnaires. In the second phase, the epidemiology of
   different FGIDs was determined using Rome III criteria. In addition,
   different psychological assessment tools were used to screen for
   anxiety, depression, psychological distress, coping styles, stressful
   life events, personality trait, and level of social support.
   Self-administered questionnaires were used in this study. RESULTS: In
   the first and second phases of the study, 8691 and 6239 adults were
   recruited, respectively. The complete information of 4763 subjects has
   been provided after linking the questionnaires from both phases.
   CONCLUSIONS: SEPAHAN project is a novel study that provides the
   opportunity of investigating epidemiological aspects of FGIDs and their

Abstract = {{When females anticipate a hazardous environment for their offspring,

   environmental experience determines egg size in different animal taxa.
   We predicted that a higher perceived predation risk by juveniles would

   test this, we exposed juveniles of the mouthbrooding cichlid Eretmodus
   cyanostictus in a split-brood experiment either to cues of a natural
   predator or to a control situation. After maturation, females that had
   been confronted with predators produced heavier eggs, whereas clutch
   size itself was not affected by the treatment. This effect cannot be
   explained by a differential female body size because the predator
   treatment did not influence growth trajectories. The observed increase
   of egg mass is likely to be adaptive, as heavier eggs gave rise to
   larger young and in fish, juvenile predation risk drops sharply with
   increasing body size. This study provides the first evidence that
   predator cues perceived by females early in life positively affect egg
   mass, suggesting that these cues allow her to predict the predation risk

Abstract = {{Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of
   behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why
   species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The
   West European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in
   part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of
   habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats.
   This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the
   result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used
   radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable
   landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, Meles meles) abundance.
   Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our
   results suggest that agricultural habitats may be `landscapes of fear'
   for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On
   agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge
   cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be
   beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number
   of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by,
   among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural
   areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat
   structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results
   emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and
   food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour

Abstract = {{Chemosensory discrimination of sex and other individual traits based on
   pheromones occurs in many reptiles. However, the use of chemoreception
   in turtle social behaviour is poorly known. We examined the role of
   chemical signals in intraspecific communication of Spanish terrapins,
   Mauremys leprosa, during the breeding season. Chemical cues released by
   terrapins in the water might inform on sex and other individual
   characteristics, such as size, body condition or health state, which are
   important in sexual selection processes. To test this hypothesis, we
   compared the time spent by turtles in water pools containing chemical
   stimuli obtained from different conspecifics. Behavioural responses
   showed that turtles were able to detect and discriminate chemical cues
   released by conspecifics, and to modify their use of space in response
   to these cues alone. Males preferred water pools with chemicals of
   females with greater immune responses, while females preferred water
   pools with odours of larger males. Preferences for water used by better
   potential partners could increase mating opportunities with these
   partners, which would increase offspring fitness. Female preference for
   large males could also be a mechanism of protection from harassment by
   small males. On the other hand, males avoided water pools with chemicals
   of heavier, or relatively heavier, males and preferred water with
   chemicals of smaller, or relatively smaller, males. Chemosensory
   assessment of body size may allow males to minimize the risk of costly
   aggressive interactions with other males. Selection of water pools based
   on chemical cues of conspecifics may allow terrapins to optimize their
   mate searching while avoiding competitors. (C) 2012 The Association for

Abstract = {{Animal populations are often limited by food and rearing offspring is
   energetically demanding. Life history theory predicts that parents of
   altricial bird species will often reduce their current reproductive
   effort when given supplementary food. Previous food supplementation
   studies have mainly focused on effects on female parents, while the
   importance of paternal behaviour has largely been neglected. We
   addressed the effects of natural and experimentally increased food
   abundance on male ranging behaviour and provisioning rate, female and
   fledgling condition, and final reproductive success, in the Tengmalm's
   owl, Aegolius funereus, a species with obligatory biparental care. We
   found that males adjusted their parental effort by reducing provisioning
   rate at food-supplemented nests. Food supplementation induced an
   increase in body mass of females, and in body mass and haematocrit
   levels of fledglings. This suggests that the amount of extra food
   provided was enough for females to increase body condition sufficiently
   to start allocating extra resources to enhance the quality of current
   offspring. While the home range size of radiomarked males was not
   affected by food supplementation, it decreased with cover of spruce
   forest, which is a habitat that is denser in structure and richer in
   prey than pine forest and especially clear-cut areas. This suggests that
   habitat-specific prey abundance and/or cover may be strong determinants
   of home range size for males. Overall, the results provide novel
   insights into how habitat quality and food supply affect male hunting

   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Flushing, New York.
   Participants: A total of 212 preschool children as a part the ongoing

   Main Exposures: Gestational diabetes mellitus and low SES.
   Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes are ADHD diagnosis based on
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
   criteria at age 6 years and several well-validated measures of
   neurobehavioral outcomes, cognitive functioning, ADHD symptoms, and
   temperament at age 4 years. Secondary outcomes are parent and teacher

   Neurobehavioral measures in relation to GDM and low SES were examined

   Results: Both maternal GDM and low SES were associated with an
   approximately 2-fold increased risk for ADHD at age 6 years. However,
   the risk by GDM was greater among lower SES families than among higher
   SES families. Children exposed to both GDM and low SES demonstrated

   14-fold (P=.006) when children were exposed to both GDM and low SES.
   Neither children exposed to maternal GDM alone nor those exposed to low
   SES alone had a notable increased risk for ADHD.
   Conclusions: Maternal GDM and low SES, especially in combination,
   heighten the risk for childhood ADHD. Longterm prevention efforts should
   be directed at mothers with GDM to avoid suboptimal neurobehavioral
   development and mitigate the risk for ADHD among their offspring.}},

Title = {{How the ladybird got its spots: effects of resource limitation on the
   honesty of aposematic signals}},

Abstract = {{1. Prey species often possess defences (e.g. toxins) coupled with
   warning signals (i.e. aposematism). There is growing evidence that the
   expression of aposematic signals often varies within species and
   correlates with the strength of chemical defences. This has led to the
   speculation that such signals may be honest, with signal reliability
   ensured by the costliness of producing or maintaining aposematic traits.
   2. We reared larval seven-spot ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata) on
   a Low or High aphid diet and measured the effects on warning signal
   expression (elytral carotenoid pigmentation, conspicuousness, spot
   size), levels of defensive alkaloids (precoccinelline, coccinelline),
   and relationships between these traits.
   3. High-diet individuals had greater total precoccinelline levels, and
   elytra carotenoid concentrations at adulthood which was detectable to a
   typical avian predator. However, larval diet did not significantly
   affect adult body mass or size, spot size or coccinelline levels.
   4. Elytra carotenoid concentrations correlated positively with total
   precoccinelline levels in both diet groups and sexes. However, the
   relationship between elytra carotenoid concentrations and total levels
   of coccinelline depended on sex: in both diet groups, elytra carotenoids
   and coccinelline levels were positively correlated in females, but
   negatively correlated in males. Spot size and coccinelline levels
   correlated positively in Low-diet individuals, but negatively in
   High-diet individuals.
   5. These results point to physiological linkages between components of
   aposematism, which are modulated by resource (i. e. food) availability
   and affect the honesty of signals. Developmental diet, but also sex,
   influenced the relationships between signals and toxin levels. Ladybirds
   are sexually size dimorphic, and thus in comparison with males, females
   may be more susceptible to resource limitation and more likely to be
   honest signallers.}},

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the adaptive
   evolution of personality, defined as inter-individual differences in
   behaviour that are consistent over time and across situations. For
   instance, the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that personality
   evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that
   vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher
   exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to
   higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which
   proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains
   poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on
   foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any
   motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged
   this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or
   combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have
   additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the
   Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41\%
   and body condition for about 20\% of the total variation in latency to
   feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency
   to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and
   positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and
   individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a
   period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction
   between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect
   of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the
   relevance of our results in relation to the different factors
   influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a
   life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of
   life-history traits and personality.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological studies of neuroendocrine regulation confirm that
   aggressive behavior patterns are nearly universal in the animal kingdom.
   Different species of fish (e.g. Zebra Fish and Siamese Fighting Fish)
   are used as models for studies of animal behavior, including aggression.
   Despite an increased risk of injury or death, aggression frequently
   offers considerable benefits. It is mainly related with competition for
   limited resources, for example, competition for food or a mate, the
   establishment of territory and dominance hierarchies (a higher social
   status). Aggression is a kind of aversive drive to limit the freedom of
   other animals of the same or other species or to injure or kill them.
   Territorial behavior is a significant problem in farm and companion
   animals, not only causing economic losses but also threatening animal
   health and welfare. The following systems are involved in the regulation
   of aggressive behavior: the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA),
   sympathetico-medullary-adrenal (SAM), hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal,
   serotonin, somatostatin, dopamine, histamine and nitric oxide pathways,
   as well as brain structures responsible for motivation. The aim of this

Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies have displayed increased interest in
   examining the relationship between personality traits and the onset,
   treatment response patterns, and relapse of depression. This study aimed
   to examine whether or not harm avoidance (HA) was a risk factor for
   postpartum depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
   Scale (EPDS) and the state dependency of HA.
   Methods: Pregnant women (n = 460; mean age 31.9 +/- 4.2 years) who
   participated in a prenatal program completed the EPDS as a measure of
   depressive state and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) as a
   measure of HA during three periods: early pregnancy (T1), late pregnancy
   (around 36 weeks), and 1 month postpartum (T2). Changes in EPDS and HA
   scores from T1 to T2 were compared between the non depressive (ND) group
   and the postpartum depressive (PD) group.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the level of HA between
   the ND and PD groups at T1. In the ND group, EPDS and HA scores did not
   change significantly from T1 to T2. In the PD group, both scores
   increased significantly from T1 to T2 (EPDS, p<0.0001; HA, p<0.048). In
   the ND and PD groups, a significant positive correlation was observed in
   changes in EPDS and HA scores from T1 to T2 (r = 0.31, p = 0.002).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that HA cannot be considered a risk
   factor for the development of postpartum depression measured by EPDS.
   Furthermore, HA may be state dependent.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},

Volume = {{231}},
Pages = {{87-100}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between
   adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship
   with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment.
   Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex
   interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems,
   particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental
   conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape
   and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics
   as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes
   and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i)
   to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate
   spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large
   scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use,
   and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands
   ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest
   ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory,
   iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the
   landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived,
   size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a
   hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at
   stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled
   to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on
   allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are
   modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior
   of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we
   conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a
   longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results
   against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4\% of
   variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This
   transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of
   species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness
   and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully
   evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth
   forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our
   approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was
   demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the
   emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex
   process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to
   contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest
   ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions. 2012 Elsevier

   in Severe Undernutrition: Evidence for the Predictive Adaptation Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Severe acute malnutrition in childhood manifests as
   oedematous (kwashiorkor, marasmic kwashiorkor) and non-oedematous
   (marasmus) syndromes with very different prognoses. Kwashiorkor differs
   from marasmus in the patterns of protein, amino acid and lipid
   metabolism when patients are acutely ill as well as after rehabilitation
   to ideal weight for height. Metabolic patterns among marasmic patients
   define them as metabolically thrifty, while kwashiorkor patients
   function as metabolically profligate. Such differences might underlie
   syndromic presentation and prognosis. However, no fundamental
   explanation exists for these differences in metabolism, nor clinical
   pictures, given similar exposures to undernutrition. We hypothesized
   that different developmental trajectories underlie these
   clinical-metabolic phenotypes: if so this would be strong evidence in
   support of predictive adaptation model of developmental plasticity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed the records of all children
   admitted with severe acute malnutrition to the Tropical Metabolism
   Research Unit Ward of the University Hospital of the West Indies,
   Kingston, Jamaica during 1962-1992. We used Wellcome criteria to
   establish the diagnoses of kwashiorkor (n = 391), marasmus (n = 383),
   and marasmic-kwashiorkor (n = 375). We recorded participants' birth
   weights, as determined from maternal recall at the time of admission.
   Those who developed kwashiorkor had 333 g (95\% confidence interval 217
   to 449, p<0.001) higher mean birthweight than those who developed
   marasmus.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data are consistent with a model
   suggesting that plastic mechanisms operative in utero induce potential
   marasmics to develop with a metabolic physiology more able to adapt to
   postnatal undernutrition than those of higher birthweight. Given the
   different mortality risks of these different syndromes, this observation
   is supportive of the predictive adaptive response hypothesis and is the
   first empirical demonstration of the advantageous effects of such a
   response in humans. The study has implications for understanding
   pathways to obesity and its cardio-metabolic co-morbidities in poor
   countries and for famine intervention programs.}},

   Design: Assessment of eating behaviour was based on the revised German

   and longitudinal data of a feasibility study in employees. Data on
   lifestyle and nutrition were obtained by validated self-administered
   questionnaires. Baseline characteristics were analysed by the univariate

   Setting: The Delay of Impaired Glucose Tolerance by a Healthy Lifestyle
   Trial (DELIGHT), which investigated measures to prevent type 2 diabetes

   Subjects: Employees (21-64 years, 127 men, 157 women) with elevated
   waist circumference (men >= 94 cm, women >= 80 cm) of five medium-sized
   companies in northern Germany.
   Results: At baseline (T0), BMI but particularly waist circumference
   showed a strong inverse correlation with flexible control (P<0.0001) and
   a positive correlation with disinhibition (P<0.0001) and rigid control
   (P<0.063). Flexible control was also significantly inversely related to

Abstract = {{Male courtship behaviour is known to correlate with body condition and
   other aspects of male phenotypic or genetic quality. Females often
   prefer males that express the most intense or elaborate displays,
   although recent findings indicate that this should not always be the
   case; males may be strategic in their courtship displays, signal
   dishonestly or deplete their energy reserves with intense courting. To
   study reliability of courtship effort as a mate choice signal, I
   assessed multiple aspects of male courtship using wild-caught sand
   gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus, in a controlled laboratory setting. I
   found consistent and repeatable between-male differences in courtship.
   However, females did not show a significant preference for males that
   courted intensively. Furthermore, other assessed male traits with a
   previously demonstrated role in sexual selection were not correlated
   with courtship effort. This indicates that courtship displays did not
   reliably signal male quality. The results also suggest that even when
   courtship has potential to convey useful information, females may have
   to trade between courtship and other cues they use in mate choice.
   Hence, to gain a more complete understanding of the selection regime
   acting on male courtship behaviour, and female preference for it, one
   should simultaneously investigate multiple factors that can affect
   female mating behaviour. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of

Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Compensatory growth and catch-up growth are often used
   interchangeably to describe the faster than optimal growth that occurs
   following a period of dietary restriction in the development of many
   animals. Concerns about the statistical analysis of these studies have
   drawn attention to the risk of false detection in reports of
   compensatory and catch-up growth.
   2. This study aims to quantify the degree to which these compensatory
   responses occur across the animal kingdom. In addition, this study
   distinguishes the two terms, `compensatory growth' and `catch-up
   growth', to clarify the fitness consequences of rapid growth.
   Compensatory growth refers to a faster than usual growth rate, while
   catch-up growth implies attainment of control size.
   3. Eight meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted on
   data extracted from 88 papers, including 11 taxonomic classes. The
   results confirmed that both growth tactics (i.e. compensatory and
   catch-up growth) occur across a wide range of taxa and result in
   decreased direct fitness components.
   4. Importantly, the meta-analytic methods used made it possible to
   identify the specific experimental techniques that most successfully
   promoted rapid growth after restriction and key differences in the
   responses of the four major groups (mammals, birds, fish and arthropods)
   to dietary restriction. Endotherms are more likely to show a
   compensatory growth response because of their determinate growth; in
   contrast, the indeterminate and saltatory growth tactics of fish and
   arthropods reduce the pressure to rapidly achieve a large size.
   5. Among the first meta-analyses to be conducted in this field, this
   study provides valuable support for the premises of compensatory and
   catch-up growth and also discusses weaknesses in experimental design,
   and possible solutions, in compensatory growth research. For example, we
   recommend conducting the experiment within the most linear phase of an
   animal's growth to avoid analytical complications arising from
   size-dependent growth, and our results indicate that dietary dilution
   more closely resembles quantitative restriction than clutch size and
   intermittent feeding restriction methods when normal quantitative
   restriction is not possible.}},

Abstract = {{Net energy availability depends on plasma corticosterone concentrations,
   food availability, and their interaction. Limited net energy
   availability requires energy trade-offs between self-maintenance and
   reproduction. This is important in matrotrophic viviparous animals
   because they provide large amounts of energy for embryos, as well as
   self-maintenance, for the extended period of time during gestation. In
   addition, gravid females may transmit environmental information to the
   embryos in order to adjust offspring phenotype. We investigated effects
   of variation in maternal plasma corticosterone concentration and
   maternal food availability (2 x 2 factorial design) during gestation on
   offspring phenotype in a matrotrophic viviparous lizard (Pseudemoia
   entrecasteauxii). Subsequently, we tested preadaptation of offspring
   phenotype to their postnatal environment by measuring risk-averse
   behavior and growth rate using reciprocal transplant experiments. We
   found that maternal net energy availability affected postpartum maternal
   body condition, offspring snout-vent length, offspring mass, offspring
   performance ability, and offspring fat reserves. Females treated with
   corticosterone allocated large amounts of energy to their own body
   condition, and their embryos allocated more energy to energy reserves
   than somatic growth. Further, offspring from females in high plasma
   corticosterone concentration showed compensatory growth. These findings
   suggest that while females may be selfish when gestation conditions are
   stressful, the embryos may adjust their phenotype to cope with the
   postnatal environment.}},

Abstract = {{Some evidence exists that cow body condition score (BCS) is associated
   with risks to animal health, and that higher BCS in extensively kept
   animals provides a buffer against cold conditions or other adverse
   weather events. Not surprisingly, measures of BCS feature in dairy
   cattle welfare assessment protocols. However, the degree to which BCS
   predicts welfare state, particularly in relation to the level of
   ``hunger{''} experienced, is not well researched. The aim of this study
   was to examine associations between naturally arising variations in BCS
   in dairy cattle and time spent engaged in activities used as proxy
   indicators of hunger. Holstein-Friesian cows (n = 113) of either North
   American or New Zealand ancestry were allocated to 1 of 3 levels of
   concentrate-feed supplementation (0, 3, or 6 kg of dry matter/d) and
   also offered pasture in excess of requirements. Body condition score (1
   to 10 scale), pasture dry matter intake (DMI), and time budgets for
   grazing, ruminating, standing, and lying were recorded during early,
   mid, and late lactation. Body condition score varied over a wide range
   (2.5 to 8.5) and, within genetic strain and supplementation level, was
   inversely associated with pasture DMI, rate of DMI, and the proportions
   of time spent grazing and ruminating. In comparison, variation in BCS
   (within genetic strain and supplementation level) was directly
   associated with variations in time spent lying (in late lactation).
   Nevertheless, pasture DMI and time spent in the key behavioral
   activities were all within the normal expected limits for pasture-fed
   dairy cows. Thus, thin cows appeared able to achieve their nutritional
   requirements. Furthermore, even though thinner cows traded-off a small
   portion of their lying time in late lactation to forage longer, they
   still rested for normal periods each day. Based on these results, we
   found no difference in the welfare status of naturally thin and fat cows
   when they were offered generous pasture allowances with or without
   concentrate supplementation. The extent to which this pertains under
   conditions of persistently low feed allowances that result in reductions
   in BCS remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Individual behaviors of animals do not evolve separately; they do so in
   association with other behaviors caused by single shared genetic or
   physiological constraints and/or favored by selection. Thus, measuring
   behavioral syndromes-suites of correlated behaviors across different
   contexts-leads to a better understanding of the adaptive significance of
   variations in behaviors. However, relatively few studies have examined
   behavioral syndromes in wild animal populations in changing
   environments. We investigated a potential behavioral syndrome across
   antipredator nest defense, territorial defense, chick provisioning, and
   mating behaviors of male Black-tailed Gulls Larus crassirostris in two
   successive years under different conspecific territorial intrusion risks
   and food conditions. Males that presented high levels of antipredator
   nest defense (aggressive antipredator defenders) against a crow decoy
   (crows are egg predators) defended their territories against conspecific
   intruders more frequently than did other males (nonaggressive
   antipredator defenders), independent of the risk of intrusion.
   Aggressive antipredator defenders also fed their chicks more frequently
   than nonaggressive males, but only in a year of low food availability.
   Taken together, this indicates that males show consistent aggressiveness
   regardless of breeding context (antipredator and territorial defense),
   but can regulate food provisioning according to food availability.}},

   METHODS: Based on the 2005 Survey of 16,146 U.S. military personnel, BB
   users were dichotomized as yes (regular use - taking any supplement of
   BB at least once a week in past 12 months) or no; similarly defined for
   WL and PE. Weighted logistic regression models are used.
   RESULTS: BB, WL and PE were used by 19.4\%, 17.0\%, and 8.0\% of
   participants, respectively. Significantly more users were overweight or
   obese: BMI >= 25 (vs. BMI <25); heavy drinkers (vs. abstainers); and
   users of taking steroids in their lifetime (vs. not). Most common
   reasons of BB, WL, and PE users wanted to increase muscle mass, lose

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have shown that prenatal exposure to the
   Dutch famine is associated with an increased risk for several
   psychiatric disorders. Variation in personality characteristics and in
   stress appraisal may underlie mental disorders.
   Aims: To investigate whether prenatal famine exposure is associated with
   personality characteristics and stress appraisal.
   Study design: Cohort study.
   Subjects: Participants included a total of 572 men and women, born as
   term singletons in a local hospital in Amsterdam around the time of the
   1944-1945 Dutch famine.
   Outcome measures: Scores on the Big Five Inventory and the Perceived
   Stress Scale (PSS).
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the
   personality traits openness. conscientiousness, extraversion,
   agreeableness and neuroticism or in PSS scores between those unexposed
   and those exposed to famine during early, mid or late gestation.
   However, there were statistically significant (P = 0.01) and borderline
   significant interactions (P = 0.07) respectively between exposure to
   famine during early gestation and sex on conscientiousness and
   agreeableness. Subsequent analyses showed that men exposed to famine
   during early gestation had lower conscientiousness scores and women
   exposed during early gestation had higher agreeableness scores.
   Conclusions: We conclude that conscientiousness and agreeableness may
   differ between men and women unexposed and exposed to famine during
   early gestation. As evidence was not very robust, future research should
   confirm the present findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Boldness, a measure of an individual's propensity for taking risks, is
   an important determinant of fitness but is not necessarily a fixed
   trait. Dependent upon an individual's state, and given certain contexts
   or challenges, individuals may be able to alter their inclination to be
   bold or shy in response. Furthermore, the degree to which individuals
   can modulate their behaviour has been linked with physiological
   responses to stress. Here we attempted to determine whether bold and shy
   rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, can exhibit behavioural plasticity
   in response to changes in state (nutritional availability) and context
   (predation threat). Individual trout were initially assessed for
   boldness using a standard novel object paradigm; subsequently, each day
   for one week fish experienced either predictable, unpredictable, or no
   simulated predator threat in combination with a high (2\% body weight)
   or low (0.15\%) food ration, before being reassessed for boldness. Bold
   trout were generally more plastic, altering levels of neophobia and
   activity relevant to the challenge, whereas shy trout were more fixed
   and remained shy. Increased predation risk generally resulted in an
   increase in the expression of three candidate genes linked to boldness,
   appetite regulation and physiological stress responses - ependymin,
   corticotrophin releasing factor and GABAA - but did not produce a
   significant increase in plasma cortisol. The results suggest a
   divergence in the ability of bold and shy trout to alter their
   behavioural profiles in response to internal and exogenous factors, and
   have important implications for our understanding of the maintenance of
   different behavioural phenotypes in natural populations. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) depend on sea ice for
   catching marine mammal prey. Recent sea-ice declines have been linked to
   reductions in body condition, survival, and population size. Reduced
   foraging opportunity is hypothesized to be the primary cause of
   sea-ice-linked declines, but the costs of travel through a deteriorated
   sea-ice environment also may be a factor. We used movement data from 52
   adult female polar bears wearing Global Positioning System (GPS)
   collars, including some with dependent young, to document long-distance
   swimming (>50 km) by polar bears in the southern Beaufort and Chukchi
   seas. During 6 years (2004-2009), we identified 50 long-distance swims

   (mean = 3.4 days) and 53.7 to 687.1 km (mean = 154.2 km), respectively.
   Frequency of swimming appeared to increase over the course of the study.
   We show that adult female polar bears and their cubs are capable of
   swimming long distances during periods when extensive areas of open
   water are present. However, long-distance swimming appears to have
   higher energetic demands than moving over sea ice. Our observations
   suggest long-distance swimming is a behavioral response to declining

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Organisms perceive changes in their dietary environment and enact a
   suite of behavioral and metabolic adaptations that can impact
   motivational behavior, disease resistance, and longevity. However, the
   precise nature and mechanism of these dietary responses is not known. We
   have uncovered a novel link between dietary factors and sleep behavior
   in Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary sugar rapidly altered sleep behavior
   by modulating the number of sleep episodes during both the light and
   dark phase of the circadian period, independent of an intact circadian
   rhythm and without affecting total sleep, latency to sleep, or waking
   activity. The effect of sugar on sleep episode number was consistent
   with a change in arousal threshold for waking. Dietary protein had no
   significant effect on sleep or wakefulness. Gustatory perception of
   sugar was necessary and sufficient to increase the number of sleep
   episodes, and this effect was blocked by activation of bitter-sensing
   neurons. Further addition of sugar to the diet blocked the effects of
   sweet gustatory perception through a gustatory-independent mechanism.
   However, gustatory perception was not required for diet-induced fat
   accumulation, indicating that sleep and energy storage are
   mechanistically separable. We propose a two-component model where
   gustatory and metabolic cues interact to regulate sleep architecture in
   response to the quantity of sugar available from dietary sources.
   Reduced arousal threshold in response to low dietary availability may
   have evolved to provide increased responsiveness to cues associated with
   alternative nutrient-dense feeding sites. These results provide evidence
   that gustatory perception can alter arousal thresholds for sleep
   behavior in response to dietary cues and provide a mechanism by which
   organisms tune their behavior and physiology to environmental cues.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to
   individual life histories and to environmental variation. The
   reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether
   individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive
   options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and
   anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis,
   however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration
   behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits
   (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk.
   Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor
   quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10
   m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be
   highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of
   time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality
   food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG
   changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments.
   This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to
   EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among
   individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the
   trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population,
   and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play
   important roles in the evolution of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions early in life can affect an organism's
   phenotype at adulthood, which may be tuned to perform optimally in
   conditions that mimic those experienced during development
   (Environmental Matching hypothesis), or may be generally superior when
   conditions during development were of higher quality (Silver Spoon
   hypothesis). Here, we tested these hypotheses by examining how diet
   during development interacted with diet during adulthood to affect adult
   sexually selected ornamentation and immune function in male mallard
   ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards have yellow, carotenoid-pigmented
   beaks that are used in mate choice, and the degree of beak coloration
   has been linked to adult immune function. Using a 2x2 factorial
   experimental design, we reared mallards on diets containing either low
   or high levels of carotenoids (nutrients that cannot be synthesized de
   novo) throughout the period of growth, and then provided adults with one
   of these two diets while simultaneously quantifying beak coloration and
   response to a variety of immune challenges. We found that both
   developmental and adult carotenoid supplementation increased circulating
   carotenoid levels during dietary treatment, but that birds that received
   low-carotenoid diets during development maintained relatively higher
   circulating carotenoid levels during an adult immune challenge.
   Individuals that received low levels of carotenoids during development
   had larger phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced cutaneous immune responses
   at adulthood; however, dietary treatment during development and
   adulthood did not affect antibody response to a novel antigen, nitric
   oxide production, natural antibody levels, hemolytic capacity of the
   plasma, or beak coloration. However, beak coloration prior to immune
   challenges positively predicted PHA response, and strong PHA responses
   were correlated with losses in carotenoid-pigmented coloration. In sum,
   we did not find consistent support for either the Environmental Matching
   or Silver Spoon hypotheses. We then describe a new hypothesis that
   should be tested in future studies examining developmental plasticity.}},

Title = {{Behavioral responses of territorial red squirrels to natural and

Abstract = {{The relative scarcity of studies at the intersection of behavioral and
   population ecology is surprising given the presumed importance of
   behavior in density-dependent population regulation. Here we tested
   whether North American red squirrels () adjust their behavior in
   response to local population density and whether they use rates of
   territorial vocalizations in their local neighborhood to assess density.
   We examined these relationships using 18 years of live trapping and 20
   years of behavioral data that were collected across natural variation in
   local population density. To disentangle the effects of population
   density on behavior from those due to changes in per capita food
   abundance or changes in the frequency of antagonistic interactions with
   neighbors, we also experimentally manipulated population density with
   long-term food supplementation as well as perceived population density
   with long-term playbacks of territorial vocalizations. The frequency
   with which squirrels emitted territorial vocalizations was positively
   associated with local population density. In contrast, antagonistic
   physical interactions observed between squirrels and territorial
   intrusions were rare and the frequency of intrusions was weakly and
   negatively, not positively, associated with population density.
   Squirrels experiencing naturally and experimentally high density
   conditions spent less time in the nest and feeding but more time being
   vigilant. Similar density-dependent changes in behavior were observed in
   response to our manipulations of perceived population density,
   indicating that vocalization rates and not physical interactions or food
   abundance were the mechanism by which squirrels assessed and responded
   behaviorally to changes in local density.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of fetal growth retardation remain unclear, in part

   chronic diseases. The uncertainty regarding the effects of post-natal
   nutrition is presenting challenges to nutritional policy as many
   countries undergo the nutrition transition, whereby the nutritional
   status of individuals may shift within the life-course. A theoretical
   model, building on the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, is presented to
   clarify how body composition data can address this dilemma. Measurements
   of body composition can now be obtained in infants and children using

Abstract = {{Personality and neural response to food cues in various mesolimbic brain

   participants (14 women, mean age = 26.0, SD = 3.3 years) with the
   Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). After an overnight fast,
   participants viewed blocks of pictures, half containing appetizing food
   and the other half showing scrambled pictures as control. After each
   block, participants rated their appetite. Brain activation was measured
   using a 3 T MR scanner. Food compared to control stimuli elicited a

   limbic centres such as the parahippocampal gyrus, the amygdala, the

Abstract = {{Individual differences in human food neophobia (the reluctance to try

Volume = {{58}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The goal of the present study was to determine whether mothers'
   assessment of their infants' temperament is associated with objective
   measures of the infant's acceptance patterns and their judgments of the
   infants' liking of a green vegetable. To this end, infants (N = 92) were
   video-recorded as their mothers fed them green beans. From these videos,
   we determined the frequency of facial distaste expressions made during
   the first 2 min of the feeding. Other measures included intake, maternal
   ratings of infants' enjoyment of this vegetable, and temperament.
   Infants who scored high on the approach dimension of the temperament
   questionnaire were less likely to express facial expressions of
   distaste, consumed more food, and were perceived by their mothers as
   enjoying the food more. Mediation analyses revealed that ratings of
   enjoyment were not directly related to the child's approach temperament,
   but rather the relationship between mothers' ratings and temperament was
   mediated by the amount of time infants spent eating the vegetable.
   Regression analyses suggested that in addition to the length of time
   children ate, mothers' ratings of their infants' enjoyment was predicted
   by the number of squints that the infant expressed during the meal.
   These findings suggest that although certain aspects of children's
   temperament are related to their food acceptance, mothers attend to
   facial expressions and time spent eating independently of these
   temperamental characteristics when judging their infant's enjoyment of a
   food. Understanding how mothers use this information to decide which
   foods to feed their infants is an important area for future research.

Abstract = {{Aphids increase production of winged individuals as a generalized

   combined threats lead to additive or non-additive outcomes. We tested
   the interactive effects of predation risk and plant quality on
   population growth and wing induction in the potato aphid, Macrosiphum
   euphorbiae. Plant quality was varied using phytohormonal manipulations
   of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) to elevate or suppress the jasmonate
   and salicylate defense pathways. Predation risk was altered by exposing
   aphids to lethal or risk (unable to feed) individuals of the convergent
   lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens. Phytohormonal treatments resulted in
   > 4-fold variation in aphid population growth and thus strongly affected
   plant quality; however, the percentage of winged individuals was no
   different across plant types. Predators similarly reduced aphid
   abundance, but also elicited a similar to 3-fold increase in wing
   formation, an effect that was similar in magnitude when comparing lethal
   with risk predators. The overall impact of plants and predators on
   aphids was largely additive, an outcome that was unexpected given the
   likelihood for interactions between these two factors and our prior
   results with other herbivores in this system. We discuss this
   discrepancy in the context of phenotypic plasticity, non-lethal predator
   effects, and the ecological challenges faced by wing dimorphic insects.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural innovations may have far-reaching evolutionary and
   ecological consequences, allowing individuals to obtain new resources
   and cope with environmental change. However, as innovations are rarely
   observed in nature, their emergence is poorly understood. What drives
   individuals to innovate, and what psychological mechanisms allow them to
   do so? We used three novel food extraction tasks to address these
   questions in groups of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Innovatory
   tendencies were unrelated to body condition and foraging success, but
   were affected by age, rank and sex. Juvenile individuals were most
   likely to interact with tasks, but seldom solved them, perhaps owing to
   their small size or lack of dexterity. Instead, adult subordinates made
   up the bulk of the innovators. In cooperatively breeding societies, the
   inability of subordinate helpers to compete physically with dominant
   breeders may drive them to seek out solutions to novel problems. Most
   innovators were males, which, as the dispersing sex, may be particularly
   prone to solve novel problems, and innovators virtually always persisted
   longer than other group members when interacting with tasks. Most
   successful individuals solved tasks more than once, and learned to
   inhibit ineffective prepotent responses across successive presentations
   of the same task. They did not learn to manipulate functional parts of
   the apparatus more efficiently, however, nor did they extract general
   rules allowing them to solve novel tasks faster. Contrary to recent
   suggestions that innovation may be cognitively demanding, these results
   suggest that simple, conserved learning processes and dogged
   perseverance may suffice to generate solutions to novel problems. (c)

Abstract = {{The relationship between food restriction and subsequent dysregulation
   of food intake is complex, variable and long-lasting. The present study
   investigated in rats whether repeated cycles of food restriction and
   binge feeding opportunities may alter regulation of food intake by
   employing a test for sensory-specific satiety. Rats that experienced
   repeated food restriction-binge cycles maintained heavier body weights
   compared to rats that remained on continuous food restriction. In
   contrast to the control subjects, rats that alternated between food
   restriction and binge feeding failed to display sensory-specific
   satiety. During the first meal, there was a gradual decrease in the
   amount of food intake over a 40 min period. When presented with a second
   meal of the same food, these rats responded to the familiar food in a
   manner similar as to a novel food (i.e., comparable quantities of both
   types of food were consumed). Food restriction-binge feeding cycles may
   be considered as a form of stress, which in turn is associated with
   cross-sensitization to numerous behavioral responses. Therefore, we
   propose that stress-induced disruption of sensory-specific satiety
   reflects a sensitized response to food, in which the interaction between
   sensory and satiety factors are no longer the key regulators of food
   choice and meal cessation. Furthermore, a role for sensory-specific
   satiety in terminating food intake appeared to decline with the
   progression of the cycles, thereby contributing to a steady increase in
   body weight of rats that experienced restriction with bouts of binge
   feeding opportunities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prey availability affects many aspects of predators' life history and is
   considered a primary factor influencing individuals' decisions regarding
   spatial ecology and behavior, but few experimental data are currently
   available. Snakes may represent ideal model organisms relative to other
   animal groups for addressing such resource dependency, due to a
   presumably more direct link between food resources and many aspects of
   behavior and natural history. We experimentally investigated the
   relationship between food intake and spatial behavior in a population of
   the snake Bothrops asper in a Costa Rican lowland rainforest. Six adult
   snakes were allowed to forage naturally while six were offered
   supplemental food in the field, with both groups monitored using
   radiotelemetry. Mean home range size did not differ between groups
   presumably due to small sample size, but supplementally fed snakes
   demonstrated altered patterns of macro- and microhabitat selection,
   shorter and less frequent movements, and increased mass acquisition. Fed
   snakes also devoted less time to foraging efforts, instead more
   frequently remaining inactive and utilizing shelter. Because snakes were
   always fed in situ and not at designated feeding stations, observed
   shifts in habitat selection are not explained by animals simply moving
   to areas of higher food availability. Rather. B. asper may have moved to
   swamps in order to feed on amphibians when necessary, but remained in
   preferred forest habitat when food was otherwise abundant. The strong
   behavioral and spatiotemporal responses of snakes in this population may
   have been influenced by an overall scarcity of mammalian prey during the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we lay out the theoretical framework for using modeling
   approaches from behavioral ecology (in particular, state-dependent and
   game theoretical models) to predict the behavioral responses of central
   place foragers to changes in their food environment. We develop
   individual-based models of the state-dependent behavior of individual
   central place foragers over the course of a breeding season and show how
   our approach provides a framework for the prediction of trip lengths,
   foraging location, food delivery, and reproductive success. We formulate
   a common framework of models for northern fur seals (Callorhinus
   ursinus), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and thick-billed
   murres (Uria lomvia), and provide worked examples parameterized to
   represent fur seals and murres. We then develop a game theoretic model
   at the colony-level for predicting the distribution of multiple
   individuals across space in the face of potential interference or
   facilitation, providing a worked example for kittiwakes. We demonstrate
   how these models can be used to predict near-term aspects of foraging
   behavior such as diet choice and trip destinations and durations at the
   individual and colony level. We show how (i) behavioral predictions can
   be translated into predictions of foraging success, (ii) foraging
   success can be scaled up to demographically relevant parameters such as
   survival and reproduction, and (iii) this approach can help predict
   impacts of environmental change on top-level predators. (C) 2012

   affect stress biology and may moderate the pathogenic relationship
   between stress reactivity and brain in limbic and prefrontal regions.
   Methods: Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) aged 19-31 years consumed
   either a standard diet (N = 18) or were maintained on 30\% CR relative
   to baseline intake (N = 26) for 13-19 years. Behavior was rated in both
   normative and aversive contexts. Urinary cortisol was collected. Animals
   underwent magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   to acquire volumetric and tissue microstructure data respectively.
   Voxel-wise statistics regressed a global stress reactivity factor,
   cortisol, and their interaction on brain indices across and between
   dietary groups.
   Results: CR significantly reduced stress reactivity during aversive
   contexts without affecting activity, orientation, or attention behavior.
   Stress reactivity was associated with less volume and tissue density in
   areas important for emotional regulation and the endocrine axis
   including prefrontal cortices, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus.
   CR reduced these relationships. A Cortisol by Stress Reactivity
   voxel-wise interaction indicated that only monkeys with high stress
   reactivity and high basal cortisol demonstrated lower brain volume and
   tissue density in prefrontal cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala.
   Conclusions: High stress reactivity predicted lower volume and
   microstructural tissue density in regions involved in emotional
   processing and modulation. A CR diet reduced stress reactivity and
   regional associations with neural modalities. High levels of cortisol
   appear to mediate some of these relationships. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{1. Environmental conditions in the present, more recent past and during
   the juvenile stage can have significant effects on adult performance and
   population dynamics, but their relative importance and potential
   interactions remain unexplored. 2. We examined the influence of food
   availability at the time of sampling, 2 months prior and during the
   juvenile stage on adult somatic growth rates in wild Trinidadian guppies
   (Poecilia reticulata). 3. We found that food availability during both
   the early and later parts of an individuals ontogeny had important
   consequences for adult growth strategies, but the direction of these
   effects differed among life stages and their magnitude, in some cases,
   depended on food levels experienced during other life stages. Current
   food levels and those 2 months prior to growth measurements had positive
   effects on adult growth rate; though, food levels 2 months prior had a
   greater effect on growth than current food levels. In contrast, the
   effects of food availability during the juvenile stage were higher in
   magnitude but opposite in direction to current food levels and those 2
   months prior to growth rate measurements. Individuals recruiting under
   low food levels grew faster as adults than individuals recruiting during
   periods of high food availability. There was also a positive interaction
   between food levels experienced during the juvenile stage and 2 months
   prior such that the effects of juvenile food level diminished as the
   food level experienced 2 months prior increased. 4. These results
   suggest that the similar conditions occurring at different life stages
   can have different effects on short- and long-term growth strategies of
   individuals within a population. They also demonstrate that, while
   juvenile conditions can have lasting effects on adult performance, the
   strength of that effect can be dampened by environmental conditions
   experienced as an adult. 5. A simultaneous consideration of past events
   in both the adult and juvenile stage may therefore improve predictions
   for individual- and population-level responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{1. Individual- and population-level variation in body size and growth
   often correlates with many fitness traits. Predation and food
   availability are expected to affect body size and growth as important
   agents of both natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. How
   differences in predation and food availability affect body size/growth
   during ontogeny in populations adapted to different predation and
   competition regimes is rarely studied. 2. Nine-spined stickleback
   (Pungitius pungitius) populations originating from habitats with varying
   levels of predation and competition are known to be locally adapted to
   their respective habitats in terms of body size and growth. Here, we
   studied how different levels of perceived predation risk and competition
   during ontogeny affect the reaction norms of body size and growth in (i)
   marine and pond populations adapted to different levels of predation and
   competition and (ii) different sexes. We reared nine-spined stickleback
   in a factorial experiment under two levels of perceived predation risk
   (present/absent) and competition (high/low food supply). 3. We found
   divergence in the reaction norms at two levels: (i) predation-adapted
   marine stickleback had stronger reactions to predatory cues than
   intraspecific competition-adapted pond stickleback, the latter being
   more sensitive to available food than the marine fish and (ii) females
   reacting more strongly to the treatments than males. 4. The repeated,
   habitat-dependent nature of the differences suggests that natural
   selection is the agent behind the observed patterns. Our results suggest
   that genetic adaptation to certain environmental factors also involves
   an increase in the range of expressible phenotypic plasticity. We found
   support for this phenomenon at two levels: (i) across populations driven

Abstract = {{1. Climate warming has led to shifts in the seasonal timing of species.
   These shifts can differ across trophic levels, and as a result, predator
   phenology can get out of synchrony with prey phenology. This can have
   major consequences for predators such as population declines owing to
   low reproductive success. However, such trophic interactions are likely
   to differ between habitats, resulting in differential susceptibility of
   populations to increases in spring temperatures. A mismatch between
   breeding phenology and food abundance might be mitigated by dietary
   changes, but few studies have investigated this phenomenon. Here, we
   present data on nestling diets of nine different populations of pied
   flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca, across their breeding range. This
   species has been shown to adjust its breeding phenology to local climate
   change, but sometimes insufficiently relative to the phenology of their
   presumed major prey: Lepidoptera larvae. In spring, such larvae have a
   pronounced peak in oak habitats, but to a much lesser extent in
   coniferous and other deciduous habitats. 2. We found strong seasonal
   declines in the proportions of caterpillars in the diet only for oak
   habitats, and not for the other forest types. The seasonal decline in
   oak habitats was most strongly observed in warmer years, indicating that
   potential mismatches were stronger in warmer years. However, in
   coniferous and other habitats, no such effect of spring temperature was
   found. 3. Chicks reached somewhat higher weights in broods provided with
   higher proportions of caterpillars, supporting the notion that
   caterpillars are an important food source and that the temporal match
   with the caterpillar peak may represent an important component of
   reproductive success. 4. We suggest that pied flycatchers breeding in
   oak habitats have greater need to adjust timing of breeding to rising
   spring temperatures, because of the strong seasonality in their food.
   Such between-habitat differences can have important consequences for
   population dynamics and should be taken into account in studies on
   phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to climate change.}},

Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1009-1020}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that individuals within populations show
   consistent differences in their behaviour across contexts (personality),
   and that personality is associated with the extent to which individuals
   adjust their behaviour as function of changing conditions (behavioural
   plasticity). We propose an evolutionary explanation for a link between
   personality and plasticity based upon how individuals manage
   uncertainty. Individuals can employ three categories of tactics to
   manage uncertainty. They can 1) gather information (sample) to reduce
   uncertainty, 2) show strategic (state-dependent) preferences for options
   that differ in their associated variances in rewards (i.e.
   variance-sensitivity), or 3) invest in insurance to mitigate the
   consequences of uncertainty. We explicitly outline how individual
   differences in the use of any of these tactics can generate
   personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity. For example,
   sampling effort is likely to co-vary with individual activity and
   exploration behaviours, while simultaneously creating population
   variation in reactions to changes in environmental conditions.
   Individual differences in the use of insurance may be associated with
   differences in risk-taking behaviours, such as boldness in the face of
   predation, thereby influencing the degree of adaptive plasticity across
   individuals. Population variation in responsiveness to environmental
   changes may also reflect individual differences in variance-sensitivity,
   because stochastic change in the environment increases variances in
   rewards, which may both attract and benefit variance-prone individuals,
   but not variance-averse individuals. We review the existing evidence
   that individual variation in strategies for managing uncertainty exist,
   and describe how positive-feedbacks between sampling,
   variance-sensitivity and insurance can maintain and exaggerate even
   small initial differences between individuals in the relative use of
   these tactics. Given the pervasiveness of the problem of uncertainty,
   alternative strategies for managing uncertainty may provide a powerful
   explanation for consistent differences in behaviour and behavioural
   plasticity for a wide range of traits.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's ability to identify and respond accurately to a predator
   greatly affects its probability of survival. Chemosensory cues are an
   important mechanism for predator detection in aquatic environments.
   Whether fish are aware of the risks posed by distinct fish species, or
   whether a common chemosensory cue distinguishes predatory fishes, is
   unknown. One possibility is that fish distinguish predatory fishes based
   on their diet. To test this, we manipulated the diet of three nominally
   non-piscivorous species and examined behavioural responses of juvenile
   anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, to chemical cues of nonpredators fed a
   diet rich in fish product. In pairwise choice trials, naive A. percula
   showed indifference to chemosensory cues from nonpiscivorous fishes fed
   their usual diet, but significantly avoided chemical cues from
   piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes fed a diet containing fish
   product. These results indicate that A. percula larvae innately
   distinguish between piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes based on
   chemosensory cues in the diet. To test for an effect of piscivorous diet
   in nature, we constructed patch reefs that emitted scents of dietary
   cues in natural concentrations. Patches that emitted scent of a
   piscivorous diet received on average 22\% less settlement than control
   patches or than patches that emitted scent of an herbivore or
   invertivore. Chemosensory detection of recent prey provides a robust cue
   to assess predation risk associated with a diverse range of fishes
   (especially during settlement) and may be reinforced through additional
   sensory (e. g. visual) and learned recognition of individual species
   consistently associated with these distinctive chemosensory cues. (C)

   Older individuals of both sexes performed slightly better in measures of
   annual reproductive performance. Age was also positively correlated
   within pairs. In some years, males in better winter body condition
   performed better, whereas higher-performing females were in worse
   condition. Because winter body condition was negatively correlated

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling

   intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour,
   which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations.
   Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main
   life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual
   differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals
   of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using
   open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity,
   exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found
   systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different
   residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high
   expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high
   current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age.
   Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body
   condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal
   variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction might maintain personality
   variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this
   life-history trade-off hypothesis.}},

Title = {{Maternal effects on male weaponry: female dung beetles produce major
   sons with longer horns when they perceive higher population density}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal effects are environmental influences on the
   phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in
   its mother, and are expected to evolve whenever females are better
   capable of assessing the environmental conditions that their offspring
   will experience than the offspring themselves. In the dung beetle
   Onthophagus taurus, conditional male dimorphism is associated with
   alternative reproductive tactics: majors fight and guard females whereas
   minors sneak copulations. Furthermore, variation in dung beetle
   population density has different fitness consequences for each male
   morph, and theory predicts that higher population density might select
   for a higher frequency of minors and/or greater expenditure on weaponry
   in majors. Because adult dung beetles provide offspring with all the
   nutritional resources for their development, maternal effects strongly
   influence male phenotype.
   Results: Here we tested whether female O. taurus are capable of
   perceiving population density, and responding by changing the phenotype
   of their offspring. We found that mothers who were reared with other
   conspecifics in their pre-mating period produced major offspring that
   had longer horns across a wider range of body sizes than the major
   offspring of females that were reared in isolation in their pre-mating
   period. Moreover, our results indicate that this maternal effect on male
   weaponry does not operate through the amount of dung provided by females
   to their offspring, but is rather transmitted through egg or brood mass
   composition. Finally, although theory predicts that females experiencing
   higher density might produce more minor males, we found no support for
   this, rather the best fitting models were equivocal as to whether fewer
   or the same proportions of minors were produced.
   Conclusions: Our study describes a new type of maternal effect in dung
   beetles, which probably allows females to respond to population density
   adaptively, preparing at least their major offspring for the sexual
   competition they will face in the future. This new type of maternal
   effect in dung beetles represents a novel transgenerational response of
   alternative reproductive tactics to population density.}},

Abstract = {{Most organisms face the problem of foraging and maintaining growth while
   avoiding predators. Typical animal responses to predator exposure
   include reduced feeding, elevated metabolism, and altered development
   rate, all of which can be beneficial in the presence of predators but
   detrimental in their absence. How then do animals balance growth and
   predator avoidance? In a series of field and greenhouse experiments, we
   document that the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta, reduced
   feeding by 30-40\% owing to the risk of predation by stink bugs, but
   developed more rapidly and gained the same mass as unthreatened
   caterpillars. Assimilation efficiency, extraction of nitrogen from food,
   and percent body lipid content all increased during the initial phase
   (1-3 d) of predation risk, indicating that enhanced nutritional
   physiology allows caterpillars to compensate when threatened. However,
   we report physiological costs of predation risk, including altered body
   composition (decreased glycogen) and reductions in assimilation
   efficiency later in development. Our findings indicate that hornworm
   caterpillars use temporally dynamic compensatory mechanisms that
   ameliorate the trade-off between predator avoidance and growth in the
   short term, deferring costs to a period when they are less vulnerable to
   predation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how animals partition effort between vigilance for
   predators and other conflicting activities has been a mainstay of animal
   behaviour research. Classical theories implicitly assume that animals
   alternate between high and low vigilance states over short timescales,
   but that average effort invested in vigilance is constant over an
   extended bout of such alternations. However, one recent model suggests
   that vigilance should be adjusted dynamically to short-term changes in
   the perception of predation risk and would tend to decrease with time.
   Indeed, as time passes by without disturbances, perception of the need
   for vigilance should decrease and prey animals may allocate more time to
   competing activities. Here, we examined how the proportion of sleeping
   gulls (Larus spp.) in loafing groups changed over time. Sleeping gulls
   can only maintain low levels of vigilance against external threats
   (compared to alert individuals), and we predicted that the proportion of
   sleeping gulls at loafing sites should increase over time when no
   disturbances occur. Statistically significant changes in the proportion
   of sleeping gulls as a function of time occurred in the majority of
   sequences and an increase was observed significantly more often than
   predicted by chance alone. This temporal pattern cannot be caused by
   reduction in hunger levels because gulls are not feeding at loafing
   sites. The results indicate that vigilance can be adjusted dynamically
   in response to short-term temporal changes in the perception of
   predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections and autoimmunity are associated
   with the onset of a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders in children,
   with the prototypical disorder being Sydenham chorea (SC). Our aim was
   to develop an animal model that resembled the behavioral,
   pharmacological, and immunological abnormalities of SC and other
   streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Male Lewis rats
   exposed to GAS antigen exhibited motor symptoms (impaired food
   manipulation and beam walking) and compulsive behavior (increased
   induced-grooming). These symptoms were alleviated by the D2 blocker
   haloperidol and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine,
   respectively, drugs that are used to treat motor symptoms and
   compulsions in streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Streptococcal exposure resulted in antibody deposition in the striatum,
   thalamus, and frontal cortex, and concomitant alterations in dopamine
   and glutamate levels in cortex and basal ganglia, consistent with the
   known pathophysiology of SC and related neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Autoantibodies (IgG) of GAS rats reacted with tubulin and caused
   elevated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling in
   SK-N-SH neuronal cells, as previously found with sera from SC and
   related neuropsychiatric disorders. Our new animal model translates
   directly to human disease and led us to discover autoantibodies targeted
   against dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the rat model as well as in SC
   and other streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract = {{An ever-expanding scientific literature highlights the impact of the

   experiences can have a substantial impact on outcomes relevant to later

   nutrition experienced by the mother during pregnancy has been shown to
   have wide-ranging and important effects on how her offspring cope with
   their social, physical and infectious environment. Variation in the
   conditions for development provided by the reproductive tract or egg,
   for instance by altered nutritional supply or hormonal exposure, may
   therefore explain a large degree of variation in many welfare- and
   productivity-relevant traits. The scientific literature suggests a
   number of management practices for pre-birth/hatch individuals that
   could compromise their later welfare. Such studies may have relevance
   for the welfare of animals under human care, depending on the extent to
   which real life conditions involve exposure to these practices. Overall,

Abstract = {{Three core symptoms of autistic spectrum disorders are stereotypic

   a dire need for behavioral paradigms to assess those symptoms in
   rodents. Here we present a novel method which is based on positive
   reward in a customized wheel-running apparatus to assess these symptoms.
   As a proof of concept, 4 mouse strains were tested in the new behavioral
   paradigm; 2 control lines (C57BL/6 and ICR) and 2 mouse-models of autism
   (BTBR T+ tf/J and Nlgn3(tm1sud)) We found that the C57BL/6. ICR and
   Nlgn3(tm1sud) mice showed a significant reduction in stereotypical
   behavior in the presence of the running wheel, ability to forfeit the
   running habit when the running-wheel was jammed, and preference of
   interacting with a social stimulus over the jammed running-wheel. No
   difference was found between genotypes of the Nlgn3(tm1sud) mice. On the
   other hand, the BTBR mice exhibited persistent, elevated levels of
   stereotypical behavior. In addition, they presented a deficit in their
   ability to adjust to a changing environment, as manifested in
   persistence to interact with the wheel even when it was jammed. Lastly,
   the BTBR mice exhibited no significant preference to interact with the
   stranger mouse over the jammed running-wheel. These results were
   validated by a set of commonly used behavioral tests. Overall, our novel
   behavioral paradigm detects multiple components of autistic-like
   phenotypes, including cognitive rigidity, stereotypic behavior and

Abstract = {{Body condition is an important determinant of fitness in many natural
   populations. However, as for many fitness traits, the underlying genes
   that regulate body condition remain elusive. The dopamine receptor D4
   gene (DRD4) is a promising candidate as dopamine is known to play an
   important role in the regulation of food intake and the metabolism of
   both glucose and lipids in vertebrates. In this study, we take advantage
   of a large data set of greater flamingos, Phoenicopterus roseus, to test
   whether DRD4 polymorphism predicts early body condition (EBC) while
   controlling for whole-genome effects of inbreeding and outbreeding using
   microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity (MLH). We typed 670 of these
   individuals for exon 3 of the homologue of the human DRD4 gene and 10
   microsatellite markers. When controlling for the effects of yearly
   environmental variations and differences between sexes, we found strong
   evidence of an association between exon 3 DRD4 polymorphisms and EBC,
   with 2.22.3\% of the variation being explained by DRD4 polymorphism,
   whereas there was only weak evidence that MLH predicts EBC. Because EBC
   is most likely a polygenic trait, this is a considerable amount of
   variation explained by a single gene. This is to our knowledge, the
   first study to show an association between exon 3 DRD4 polymorphism and
   body condition in non-human animals. We anticipate that the DRD4 gene as
   well as other genes coding for neurotransmitters and their receptors may
   play an important role in explaining variation in traits that affect
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Poor prenatal nutrition has been associated with
   schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the Netherlands and China, and it
   has been suggested that perinatal and postnatal nutritional factors lead
   to the development of schizophrenia and the exhibition of schizotypal
   traits later in life. There appears to be no prior research on the
   existence of possible factors that may mediate the relationship between
   malnutrition and schizophrenia spectrum disorders or whether this
   association is a direct one. The authors tested the hypothesis that low
   IQ mediates the relationship between early childhood malnutrition and
   adult schizotypal personality.
   Method: Participants were drawn from a birth cohort of 1,795 boys and
   girls who were followed prospectively. Objective indicators of
   malnutrition (anemia and stunting) were assessed at age 3. Verbal and
   performance intelligence were assessed at age 11, and schizotypal
   personality was assessed at age 23.
   Results: Both stunting and anemia at age 3 were associated with low IQ
   at age 11. Low performance IQ at age 11 was associated with increased
   interpersonal and disorganized features of schizotypal personality at
   age 23. Poor performance IQ was found to mediate the relationship
   between poor nutrition at age 3 and interpersonal and disorganized
   features of schizotypy at age 23. Findings in female participants were
   replicated in male participants.
   Conclusions: Given that poor nutrition is an alterable risk factor,
   these findings suggest that nutritional enhancements may improve brain
   functioning and possibly reduce some features of schizotypal personality

   snail as a first intermediate host, fathead minnows as a second
   intermediate host, and a piscivorous bird as a final host. Metacercariae
   of black spot encyst in the dermal and epidermal tissues, while
   metacercariae of O. ptychocheilus encyst on the brain over a region that

Abstract = {{There is a growing body of evidence from across animal taxa that
   exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids during development can
   have profound long-term effects upon physiological and behavioral
   phenotypes. Several avian studies have revealed that the degree to which
   an individual's hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responds to
   stressful stimuli as an adult may in effect have been `programmed' or
   set as a result of that individual's corticosterone exposure in ovo or
   as a nestling. Developmental exposure to corticosterone may also have
   effects upon avian `personalities' or coping styles, and evidence from
   mammalian studies suggests that these long-term effects are mediated
   epigenetically via altered expression of relevant DNA sequences.
   Although there does not appear to be a consistent across-species
   pattern, developmental exposure to elevated corticosterone levels may
   shape adult coping style with such exposure, resulting in adults that
   are more timid and with increased HPA axis responsiveness to stress than
   those individuals that were exposed to relatively little corticosterone
   as nestlings. Recent work in Florida Scrub-jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens) has found that baseline corticosterone levels in nestlings
   at 11 days post-hatch explained 84\% of the variation in `personality'
   (bold vs. timid) when those individuals were tested at approximately 7
   months of age. The overall `personality' scores at 7-8 months of age
   were based upon tests that evaluated and combined the Jays' responses to
   three tests: two startle and one neophobia stimuli. Here, we present
   findings on some of the factors that contribute to corticosterone levels
   of nestling Florida Scrub-jays, both within and among broods. Our prior
   and continuing research, as this overview will present, suggests that
   maternal attentiveness at the nest and paternal provisioning are
   important factors that mediate nestling corticosterone levels.}},

Abstract = {{While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies-the addition of
   energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries-can affect
   consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy
   levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and
   resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little
   information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly
   associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important
   role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these
   knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position,
   size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus
   spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot
   dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ
   strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from
   seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the
   habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no
   impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have
   any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However,
   it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of
   both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had
   higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher
   trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level
   forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes
   in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses.
   These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive
   important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical
   response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers
   also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs,
   with longer overall food chain length.}},

   the costs and benefits of mating in tettigoniids, focussing on nuptial
   gifts, their trade-off with male calling songs, protandry and how mate
   density influences mate choice. Tettigoniids have been widely used as
   model systems for studies of mating costs and benefits; they can provide
   useful general insights. The production and exchange of large nuptial
   gifts by males for mating is an important reproductive strategy in
   tettigoniids. As predicted by sexual selection theory spermatophylax
   size is condition dependent and is constrained by the need to invest in
   calling to attract mates also. Under some circumstances, females benefit
   directly from the nuptial gifts by an increase in reproductive output.
   However, compounds in the nuptial gift can also benefit the male by
   prolonging the period before the female remates. There is also a
   trade-off between adult male maturation and mating success. Where males
   mature before females (protandry) the level of protandry varies in the
   direction predicted by sperm competition theory; namely, early male
   maturation is correlated with a high level of first inseminations being
   reproductively successful. Lastly, mate density in bushcrickets is an
   important environmental factor influencing the behavioural decisions of
   individuals. Where mates are abundant, individuals are more choosey of
   mates; when they are scarce, individuals are less choosey. This review
   reinforces the view that tettigoniids provide excellent models to test
   and understand the economics of matings in both sexes.}},

Title = {{Temperament and Hunger Interact to Determine the Emergence of Leaders in
   Pairs of Foraging Fish}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Studies on leadership have focused either on physiological state as the
   key predictor (i.e. ``leading according to need{''}), or else on
   temperamental asymmetries among group members (i.e. intrinsic
   leadership). In this paper, we explore how both factors interact in
   determining the emergence of leaders. We observed pairs of sticklebacks
   with varying degrees of temperamental difference, and recorded their
   movements back and forth between a safe covered area and a risky
   foraging area, both before and after satiating one of the two pair
   members (but not the other). Before satiation, when the fish had similar
   hunger levels, temperament was a good predictor of social roles, with
   the bolder member of a pair leading and the shyer member following. The
   effect of satiation depended on which fish received the additional food.
   When the shyer member of a pair was fed, and consequently became less
   active, the bolder fish did not change its behaviour but continued to
   lead. By contrast, when the bolder member of a pair was fed, and
   consequently initiated fewer trips out of cover, the shyer partner
   compensated by initiating trips more frequently itself. In pairs that
   differed only a little in temperament, feeding the bolder fish actually
   led to a role reversal, with the shyer fish emerging as a leader in the
   majority of joint trips out of cover. Our results show that leadership
   emerges as the consequence of multiple factors, and that their
   interaction can be complex.}},

Abstract = {{Background Parenting behaviours are influenced by a range of factors,

   parental fatigue on parenting practices is not known. The first aim of
   this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and
   parenting practices. The second aim was to identify parental
   psychosocial factors significantly associated with fatigue. Methods A
   sample of 1276 Australian parents, of at least one child aged 05 years,
   completed a survey. Demographic, psychosocial (social support, coping
   responses) and parental sleep and self-care information was collected.
   Hierarchical regression was performed to assess the contribution of
   fatigue (modified Fatigue Assessment Scale) to parental practices
   (warmth, irritability and involvement), and parenting experiences
   (Parenting Stress Index, Parenting Sense of Competence Scale).
   Hierarchical multiple regression assessed the contribution of a range of
   parental sleep, psychosocial (social support, coping responses) and
   self-care variables to fatigue when demographic characteristics were
   held constant. Results Higher fatigue was significantly associated with
   lower parental competence (beta=-0.17, P < 0.005), greater parenting
   stress (beta= 0.21, P < 0.005) and more irritability in parentchild
   interactions (beta= 0.11, P < 0.005). Several psychosocial
   characteristics were associated with higher parental fatigue, including
   inadequate social support, poorer diet, poorer sleep quality and
   ineffective coping styles including self-blame and behaviour
   disengagement. Conclusions Fatigue is common, and results suggest that
   fatigue contributes to adverse parental practices and experiences.
   However, possible risk factors for higher fatigue were identified in
   this study, indicating opportunities for intervention, management and

Abstract = {{Predation threat-associated behavioral response was studied in Rana

   fed on prey tadpoles or insects (Notonecta spp.) and water conditioned

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{1. To better predict effects of climate change and predation risk on
   prey animals and ecosystems, we need studies documenting not only
   latitudinal patterns in growth rate but also growth plasticity to
   temperature and predation risk and the underlying proximate mechanisms:
   behaviour (food intake) and digestive physiology (growth efficiency).
   The mechanistic underpinnings of predator-induced growth increases
   remain especially poorly understood. 2. We reared larvae from replicated
   northern and southern populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a
   common garden experiment manipulating temperature and predation risk and
   quantified growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency. 3. The
   predator-induced and temperature-induced growth accelerations were the
   same at both latitudes, despite considerably faster growth rates in the
   southern populations. While the higher growth rates in the southern
   populations and the high rearing temperature were driven by both an
   increased food intake and a higher growth efficiency, the higher growth
   rates under predation risk were completely driven by a higher growth
   efficiency, despite a lowered food intake. 4. The emerging pattern that
   higher growth rates associated with latitude, temperature and predation
   risk were all (partly or completely) mediated by a higher growth
   efficiency has two major implications. First, it indicates that energy
   allocation trade-offs and the associated physiological costs play a
   major role both in shaping large-scale geographic variation in growth
   rates and in shaping the extent and direction of growth rate plasticity.
   Secondly, it suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic
   food chains, where damselfly larvae are important intermediate
   predators, will be higher in southern populations, at higher
   temperatures and under predation risk. This may eventually contribute to
   the lengthening of food chains under these conditions and highlights
   that the prey identity may determine the influence of predation risk on
   food chain length.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An impaired ability to compensate for calories and increased
   eating in the absence of hunger (EAR) has been associated with increased
   energy intake and weight gain in unrelated children.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to compare caloric compensation
   {[}the percentage compensation index (\%COMPX)] and EAH in
   weight-discordant siblings aged 5-12 y.
   Design: In a crossover, behavioral genetics design, 47 same-sex sibling
   pairs (53\% female, 55\% full siblings) were served dinner once a week
   for 3 wk. Across conditions, siblings were served the same dinner, but
   25 min before dinner, they either consumed in full or did not consume 1
   of 2 preloads that varied in energy density (ED; 0.57 or 0.97 kcal/g).
   On the day when no preload was consumed, EAH was assessed after dinner
   and defined as the number of calories consumed from snacks.
   Results: Overweight/obese siblings undercompensated {[}\%COMPX: -48.8
   +/- 56.3 (mean +/- SEM)] and therefore overate after the high-ED
   preload, whereas normal-weight siblings showed accurate compensation
   (\%COMPX: 101.3 +/- 51.9; P = 0.03). Furthermore, overweight/obese
   siblings consumed 34\% more calories (93 kcal) in the absence of hunger
   than did normal-weight siblings (P = 0.01). Within-pair resemblances for
   \%COMPX and EAH were stronger for full siblings (P < 0.049) than for
   half siblings (P > 0.23).
   Conclusions: An impaired ability to regulate short-term energy intake,
   which includes incomplete adjustment for calorie differences in a
   preload and eating when satiated, may represent a behavioral phenotype
   for obesity in children. Future studies should test whether teaching
   children to focus on internal satiety cues may prevent at-risk children

Abstract = {{Predation is a complex behavioural process and it is only through
   identifying the different factors influencing each stage that is it
   possible to understand the evolutionary processes driving the arms race
   between predators and prey. Using a long-term data set from Serengeti
   National Park in Tanzania, we investigated the importance of
   demographic, environmental, and prey-based factors in influencing the
   success of hunt stages of a stalking predator, the cheetah, Acinonyx
   jubatus. The chase and overall hunting success were influenced by the
   age of the cheetah and prey size, while the effect of habitat features
   could only be seen in the stalk. Whether a stalk turned into a chase was
   dependent on prey size, and in the dry season on proximity to rivers.
   Contrary to expectation, the hunger level of the cheetah, the presence
   of cubs, and the type of habitat where the hunt took place had no effect
   on hunting success. Different factors thus affect the success of
   individual hunt stages, and the predation risk of prey is influenced not
   only by its size, the habitat it is in, and the age of the its predator,
   but also by hunt stage. This reveals an increased complexity of
   predation risk that has implications for predator and prey dynamics,
   especially in systems with multiple predator and prey species. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Precopulatory sexual cannibalism may represent the most extreme form of
   sexual conflict because it necessarily truncates the reproductive
   potential of the victim. Three of the most prominent mechanisms invoked
   to explain incidence of precopulatory sexual cannibalism are the
   `adaptive foraging', `aggressive spillover' and `mate choice'
   hypotheses. These hypotheses argue that sexual cannibalism is either (1)
   the result of female choice, where females gauge the benefits of suitors
   as perspective mates versus prey, (2) a neutral (or deleterious)
   by-product of selection on aggressiveness in nonreproductive contexts,
   or (3) a mechanism by which females express their mating preferences,
   respectively. We tested the predictions of these hypotheses in the
   funnel-web spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica using staged laboratory
   encounters. We then tracked numerous fitness proxies of cannibalistic
   versus noncannibalistic females to determine whether cannibalism was
   associated with increased female performance. We found that more
   aggressive females and those deprived of food were more likely to engage
   in precopulatory cannibalism. Cannibalism was not associated with male
   condition, male body size or female body size, nor with the mass of
   females' egg cases, the number of eggs therein, or the mass of
   individual eggs. In contrast, there was a positive association between
   the mass of the egg case and the number of offspring that emerged in
   cannibalistic females, but not in noncannibalistic females. Thus,
   offspring of cannibalistic mothers appear to have increased hatching
   success in heavier egg cases. This may represent a novel advantage

Abstract = {{Animals adopt varied foraging tactics in order to survive.
   Kleptoparasitism, where animals attempt to steal food already discovered
   by others, is very common among animal species. In this situation,
   depending on the ecological conditions, challenged animals might defend,
   share, or even retreat and leave their food to the challenger. A key
   determinant of the likely behavior is the nature of the food itself. If
   food is discovered in divisible clumps, it can be divided between
   animals in a number of ways. This is the general assumption in one type
   of game-theoretical model of food stealing, producer-scrounger models.
   Alternatively, food items may be essentially indivisible, so that
   sharing is impossible and either the attacker or the defender must
   retain control of all of the food. This is the assumption of the
   alternative game-theoretical models of kleptoparasitism. In this paper,
   using a game-theoretic approach, we relax this assumption of
   indivisibility and introduce the possibility of limited food sharing
   behavior between animals in kleptoparasitic populations. Considering the
   conditions under which food sharing is likely to be common, it is shown
   that food sharing should occur in a wide range of ecological conditions.
   In particular, if food availability is limited, the sharing process does
   not greatly reduce the short-term consumption rate of food and food
   defense has a high cost and/or a low probability of success, then the
   use of the food sharing strategy is beneficial. Thus, the assumption of
   the indivisibility of food items is an important component of previous
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme developmental plasticity within the eusocial insects defines the
   separation between the queen and worker castes. The switch between these
   2 developmental pathways is thought to be under tight social control.
   Although a large emphasis has been placed on the effect of larval
   nutrition on caste determination, workers of many species have no direct
   control over larval feeding. This may be particularly relevant to the
   early evolution of ants, when behaviors that allow fine control over
   larval nutrition, such as mouth-to-mouth food exchange between larvae
   and workers, were probably not yet present. We investigated
   larval-directed aggression as an alternative means to regulate queen
   development in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, a species that retains
   ancestral characteristics. We tested worker response toward natural
   queen-destined larvae and larvae induced to develop as queens using a
   juvenile hormone analog (JHA). Workers from colonies that were not
   rearing queens bit queen-destined larvae, whereas worker-destined larvae
   were not attacked. When colonies were naturally rearing queens, workers
   did not bite JHA-treated larvae, and a larger proportion of these larvae
   developed into queens compared with larvae that received biting. This
   supports the hypothesis that workers of H. saltator use biting to
   inhibit queen development during periods when the conditions for queen
   rearing are not met. We propose that mechanical stress, in addition to
   nutrition, could serve as a mechanism to regulate queen development in
   species that lack fine control over larval food consumption, and this
   may have played a role during the early evolution of eusociality in
   ants.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection eliminates phenotypic variation from populations,
   generation after generationan observation that haunted Darwin. So, how
   does new phenotypic variation arise, and is it always random with
   respect to fitness? Repeated behavioral responses to a novel
   environmentparticularly those that are learnedare typically
   advantageous. If those behaviors yield more extreme or novel
   morphological variants via developmental plasticity, then previously
   cryptic genetic variation may be exposed to natural selection.
   Significantly, because the mean phenotypic effect of use and disuse is
   also typically favorable, previously cryptic genetic variation can be
   transformed into phenotypic variation that is both visible to selection
   and biased in an adaptive direction. Therefore, use-induced
   developmental plasticity in a very real sense creates new phenotypic
   variation that is nonrandom with respect to fitness, in contrast to the
   random phenotypic effects of mutation, recombination, and direct effects
   of environment (stress, nutrition). I offer here (a) a brief review of
   the immense literature on the effects of use and disuse on morphology,
   (b) a simple yet general model illustrating how cryptic genetic
   variation may be exposed to selection by developmentally plastic
   responses that alter trait performance in response to use and disuse,

   learning (handed behavior) and morphological plasticity (use-induced
   morphological asymmetry) that may rapidly generate novel phenotypic
   variation and facilitate the evolution of conspicuous morphological
   asymmetries. Evidence from several sources suggests that handed

Abstract = {{Vegetarian diets attract more and more attention due to growing concerns
   about health, ecology and/or animal welfare in general population. The
   main purpose of this paper was to examine whether vegetarianism could be
   associated with some specific personality characteristics, with the
   emphasis on the main motivational factors which determined acquiring the
   diet. Since the nutrition is also an important determinant of bone
   health we additionally analyzed the association between personal
   characteristics and bone density. On a sample of 109 adult vegetarians
   of both sexes we applied Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (including
   Psychoticism, Extraversion, Neuroticism and Lie scale), bone
   densitometry and questionnaire on dominant motives for dietary choices.
   The results on overall personality characteristics, bone density and
   basic anthropometric measures were within expected values for age.
   Vegetarian men had significantly more fractures during lifetime and
   lower neuroticism scores than women. Dominant motivational factors for
   acquiring vegetarianism were moral values. In addition ``moral
   vegetarians showed more pronounced introversion compared to ``health
   vegetarians{''}, lending further support to the argument that
   personality plays an important role in the structure of motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Psychological stress, which deteriorates mental and physical
   health of individuals at their working environment, is an important
   problem for public health and health at work. Recent studies have
   indicated that living with animals might be beneficial for individuals
   with physical, mental and social health problems, and it could even
   increase the quality of life in these people. In this present study, we
   aimed to investigate the relationship between pet ownership,
   psychological stress level, regular exercising, and smoking among white
   collar workers.
   Material and Method: In this cross-sectional study, 212 out of 230 white
   collar workers (92\%), who worked for a business company in Besiktas
   district of Istanbul, were enrolled. 12-Item General Health
   Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were applied to define psychological stress
   levels and mental health conditions of the workers. Data obtained from
   GHQ-12 was evaluated by using Goldberg type grading method (0-0-1-1).
   Sociodemographic characteristics of participants, and information about
   the relationship between pet ownership, and smoking, regular exercising
   were obtained by a questionnaire form made up of close- and open-ended
   questions. Data were evaluated by percentage distribution, Chi square
   test and Mann Whitney U test.
   Results: Of the participants, 51 were female, 161 were male, and the
   mean of age was 30.65 +/- 3.56 years. Among the participants, 82 had
   pets and 130 individuals had no pet. Rate of pet owners was 98.7\% in
   our study group with total score of GHQ-12 <= 1, whereas all
   participants with the score of 2-3 (moderate) had pets. Moreover, 129
   participants, the entire group except one individual, with the total
   score of GHQ-12 >= 4 expressed that they had no pets. GHQ-12 scores
   among pet owners were statistically significantly lower than the ones
   without pets (p<0.001). Smoking rate was statistically significantly
   higher among participants without pets than the rate in pet owners
   (p<0.001). Pet owner participants were exercising significantly more
   regularly than the ones without pets (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: As far as the reported changes in behavior and attitudes of
   participants, pet ownership had favorable effects in healthy life
   behaviors like nutrition, regular exercising, and non-smoking. According
   to the results of General Health Questionnaire among workers,
   psychological stress level was higher among participants without pets.
   We believe that having a pet can be supportive for improving physical
   and mental health conditions of individuals, who are working under
   stressful conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse fetal environment due to maternal undernutrition or exposure to
   environmental chemicals alters glucocorticoid (GC) metabolism increasing
   the risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of maternal exposure to cadmium (Cd, 50 ppm)
   during pregnancy in the methylation of fetal hepatic glucocorticoid
   receptor promoter (GR) and the correlation with its expression and that
   of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1a and 3a). We also studied the
   expression of liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and
   acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), two enzymes involved in the metabolism of
   carbohydrates and lipids respectively. The methylation of the rat GR
   gene exon 1(10) (GR1(10)) in nucleotides -2536 to -2361 was analyzed by
   pyrosequencing. Quantitative real time PCR was used to assess hepatic
   GR, PEPCK and AOX mRNA, and their protein levels using Western blotting
   analysis. Differential methylation was noted across groups at all CpG
   sites in the GR exon 110 in a sex-dependent manner. In males, CpG were
   more methylated than the controls (185 +/- 21\%, p<0.001) but only CpG
   sites 1,6,7 and 9 showed a significantly different extent of
   methylation. In addition, a lower expression of GR (mRNA and protein)
   was found. On the contrary, in females, CpG were less methylated than
   the controls (62 +/- 11\%, p<0.05) and overexpressed, affecting PEPCK
   and AOX expression, which did not change in males. The GR methylation
   profile correlates with DNMT3a expression which may explain epigenetic
   sex-dependent changes on GR1(10) promoter induced by Cd treatment. In
   conclusion, Cd exposure during pregnancy affects fetal liver DNMT3a
   resulting in sex-dependent changes in methylation and expression of
   GR1(10). Although these effects do not seem to be directly involved in
   the low birth weight and height, they may have relevant implications for
   long-term health.}},

Title = {{Widespread and persistent invasions of terrestrial habitats coincident
   with larval feeding behavior transitions during snail-killing fly
   evolution (Diptera: Sciomyzidae)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Transitions in habitats and feeding behaviors were
   fundamental to the diversification of life on Earth. There is ongoing
   debate regarding the typical directionality of transitions between
   aquatic and terrestrial habitats and the mechanisms responsible for the
   preponderance of terrestrial to aquatic transitions. Snail-killing flies
   (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) represent an excellent model system to study such
   transitions because their larvae display a range of feeding behaviors,
   being predators, parasitoids or saprophages of a variety of mollusks in
   freshwater, shoreline and dry terrestrial habitats. The remarkable genus
   Tetanocera (Tetanocerini) occupies five larval feeding groups and all of
   the habitat types mentioned above. This study has four principal
   objectives: (i) construct a robust estimate of phylogeny for Tetanocera
   and Tetanocerini, (ii) estimate the evolutionary transitions in larval
   feeding behaviors and habitats, (iii) test the monophyly of feeding
   groups and (iv) identify mechanisms underlying sciomyzid habitat and
   feeding behavior evolution.
   Results: Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of molecular
   data provided strong support that the Sciomyzini, Tetanocerini and
   Tetanocera are monophyletic. However, the monophyly of many behavioral
   groupings was rejected via phylogenetic constraint analyses. We
   determined that (i) the ancestral sciomyzid lineage was terrestrial,
   (ii) there was a single terrestrial to aquatic habitat transition early
   in the evolution of the Tetanocerini and (iii) there were at least 10
   independent aquatic to terrestrial habitat transitions and at least 15
   feeding behavior transitions during tetanocerine phylogenesis. The
   ancestor of Tetanocera was aquatic with five lineages making independent
   transitions to terrestrial habitats and seven making independent
   transitions in feeding behaviors.
   Conclusions: The preponderance of aquatic to terrestrial transitions in
   sciomyzids goes against the trend generally observed across eukaryotes.
   Damp shoreline habitats are likely transitional where larvae can change
   habitat but still have similar prey available. Transitioning from
   aquatic to terrestrial habitats is likely easier than the reverse for
   sciomyzids because morphological characters associated with
   air-breathing while under the water's surface are lost rather than
   gained, and sciomyzids originated and diversified during a general
   drying period in Earth's history. Our results imply that any animal
   lineage having aquatic and terrestrial members, respiring the same way
   in both habitats and having the same type of food available in both
   habitats could show a similar pattern of multiple independent habitat
   transitions coincident with changes in behavioral and morphological
   traits.}},

Title = {{Modelling Sensory Limitation: The Role of Tree Selection, Memory and
   Information Transfer in Bats' Roost Searching Strategies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Sensory limitation plays an important role in the evolution of animal
   behaviour. Animals have to find objects of interest (e.g. food,
   shelters, predators). When sensory abilities are strongly limited,
   animals adjust their behaviour to maximize chances for success. Bats are
   nocturnal, live in complex environments, are capable of flight and must
   confront numerous perceptual challenges (e.g. limited sensory range,
   interfering clutter echoes). This makes them an excellent model for
   studying the role of compensating behaviours to decrease costs of
   finding resources. Cavity roosting bats are especially interesting
   because the availability of tree cavities is often limited, and their
   quality is vital for bats during the breeding season. From a bat's
   sensory point of view, cavities are difficult to detect and finding them
   requires time and energy. However, tree cavities are also long lasting,
   allowing information transfer among conspecifics. Here, we use a simple
   simulation model to explore the benefits of tree selection, memory and
   eavesdropping (compensation behaviours) to searches for tree cavities by
   bats with short and long perception range. Our model suggests that
   memory and correct discrimination of tree suitability are the basic
   strategies decreasing the cost of roost finding, whereas perceptual
   range plays a minor role in this process. Additionally, eavesdropping
   constitutes a buffer that reduces the costs of finding new resources
   (such as roosts), especially when they occur in low density. We conclude
   that natural selection may promote different strategies of roost finding
   in relation to habitat conditions and cognitive skills of animals.}},

Title = {{Behavioral and physiological female responses to male sex ratio bias in
   a pond-breeding amphibian}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The phenomenon of sexual conflict has been well
   documented, and in populations with biased operational sex ratios the
   consequences for the rarer sex can be severe. Females are typically a
   limited resource and males often evolve aggressive mating behaviors,
   which can improve individual fitness for the male while negatively
   impacting female condition and fitness. In response, females can adjust
   their behavior to minimize exposure to aggressive mating tactics or
   minimize the costs of mating harassment. While male-male competition is
   common in amphibian mating systems, little is known about the
   consequences or responses of females. The red-spotted newt
   (Notophthalmus viridescens) is a common pond-breeding amphibian with a
   complex, well-studied mating system where males aggressively court
   females. Breeding populations across much of its range have male-biased
   sex ratios and we predicted that female newts would have behavioral
   mechanisms to mitigate mating pressure from males. We conducted four
   experiments examining the costs and behavioral responses of female N.
   viridescens exposed to a male-biased environment.
   Results: In field enclosures, we found that female newts exposed to a
   male-biased environment during the five-month breeding season ended with
   lower body condition compared to those in a female-biased environment.
   Shorter-term exposure to a male-biased environment for five weeks caused
   a decrease in circulating total leukocyte and lymphocyte abundance in
   blood, which suggests females experienced physiological stress. In
   behavioral experiments, we found that females were more agitated in the
   presence of male chemical cues and females in a male-biased environment
   spent more time in refuge than those in a female-biased environment.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that male-biased conditions can incur
   costs to females of decreased condition and potentially increased risk
   of infection. However, we found that females can also alter their
   behavior and microhabitat use under a male-biased sex ratio. Consistent
   with surveys showing reduced detection probabilities for females, our
   research suggests that females avoid male encounters using edge and
   substrate habitat. Our work illustrates the integrated suite of impacts
   that sexual conflict can have on the structure and ecology of a
   population.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2159-2174}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species present a global threat to natural ecosystems and
   native biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that invasive range
   expansion is often related to the invader's life histories and dispersal
   behavior. Among behavioral traits, boldness is a key trait that may aid
   species in performing well in novel environments. Thus, along a species'
   invaded range, individuals from the invasion front should be bolder,
   better dispersers, and have life histories that maximize population
   growth relative to established populations. We tested these hypotheses
   with the invasion of the African jewelfish Hemichromis letourneuxi in
   Everglades National Park (ENP). Jewelfish entered ENP in 2000, and since
   then they have expanded their range rapidly but traceably. Our study
   examined variation in reproductive investment, body condition, gut
   fullness, boldness, and dispersal behavior across six wild-caught
   populations of African jewelfish. Boldness and dispersal were tested
   using an emergence-activity test and an emergence-dispersal test in
   large, outdoor experimental setups. We dissected fish from the six
   populations to assess life histories. Populations from the invasion
   front (western ENP) had higher reproductive investment, higher gut
   fullness, and better body condition, but they were not relatively bolder
   nor better dispersers than inner populations (eastern ENP). As the
   invasion progressed, lower intraspecific density at the invasion front
   may have relaxed competition and allowed for higher fitness and
   reproductive investment. Understanding underlying behavioral and
   life-history mechanisms of an invasion is key for the development of
   management strategies that aim to contain current invaders and prevent
   the spread of future ones.}},
