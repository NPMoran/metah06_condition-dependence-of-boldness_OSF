Abstract = {{Traits that facilitate competition for reproductive resources or that
   influence mate choice generally have a heightened sensitivity to
   stressors. They have evolved to signal resilience to infectious disease
   and nutritional and social stressors, and they are compromised by
   exposure to man-made toxins. Although these traits can differ from one
   species or sex to the next, an understanding of the dynamics of
   competition and choice can in theory be used to generate a priori
   predictions about sex-, age-, and trait-specific vulnerabilities for any
   sexually reproducing species. I provide a review of these dynamics and
   illustrate associated vulnerabilities in nonhuman species. The age- and
   sex-specific vulnerability of such traits is then illustrated for
   stressor-related disruptions of boys' and girls' physical growth and
   play behavior, as well as for aspects of boys' and girls' and men's and
   women's personality, language, and spatial abilities. There is much that
   remains to be determined, but enough is now known to reframe trait
   sensitivity in ways that will allow scientists and practitioners to
   better identify and understand vulnerable human traits, and eventually
   ameliorate or prevent their expression.}},

Abstract = {{Mate preference was long assumed to be static and open-ended. However, a
   growing body of evidence actually suggests that the predominant factor
   in mate choice fluctuates due to the context dependence of the factors
   involved in sexual selection. In particular, fluctuation in the local
   environment, the density of individuals, and the presence of
   heterospecifics can all alter the strength, form, or direction of sexual
   selection by shaping the fitness costs and benefits of the traits that
   mediate male-female interactions. Amphibians constitute useful
   biological models to examine context dependence in sexual selection as
   the availability of suitable breeding resources may significantly impact
   the cost-benefit trade-off between mating strategies. Using an
   experimental approach, we examined how the risk of larval competition in
   breeding ponds affects pond occupancy, male-male spacing behavior, and
   spawning decisions in an anuran, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina
   variegata). Then, we examined how female mate choice is affected by male
   body condition and how the risk of larval competition might influence
   females when choosing a mate. Our results indicate that male pond
   preference is strongly affected by the presence of conspecific tadpoles.
   Males preferentially selected ponds free of tadpoles, and spawning
   mainly occurred in these same ponds. This preference influenced male
   spacing behavior by enhancing the proximity of competing males when the
   availability of good-quality sites was experimentally manipulated, which
   had further significant consequences on females' choice of mate. The
   article also discusses the evolutionary causes and consequences of such
   context-dependent mate choice in amphibians and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization constitutes one of the most profound forms of land-use
   change and strongly affects global biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. Expansion of urban areas typically leads to species loss
   but may also induce more subtle changes in species dynamics through
   selection or plasticity. Using a dual correlative (field) and
   experimental (aviary) approach, we here show that free-ranging urban
   house sparrows in southern France were smaller and lighter than their
   rural counterparts after allometric scaling, whereas 2 independent
   indices of nutritional (feather growth rates) and developmental (feather
   asymmetry) stress did not vary with urbanization. When subjecting these
   individuals to urban or rural diets in a highly predictable, controlled
   setting, rural but not urban sparrows decreased their body mass,
   independent of diet type, to the extent that initial scaled mass
   differences between urban and rural birds disappeared by the end of the
   captive period. By integrating field-and aviary measurements of body
   size and mass with indices of nutritional and developmental stress, we
   conclude that the lower scaled body masses of urban birds likely reflect
   a plastic response to predictable food supplies, possibly mediated
   through predation. Urban environments therefore do not necessarily
   constitute nutritionally stressful environments for species that
   typically cohabit with humans, such as house sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Personality is an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it
   constrains behavioral flexibility. One theory suggests that personality
   could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It
   is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival
   probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among
   individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social
   niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals
   that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social
   conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the
   social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for
   development after a change in social status. In the facultative
   cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis),
   residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this
   forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to
   test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual
   differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an
   individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young
   individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age
   reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers,
   suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's
   social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will
   be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social
   state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social
   state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However,
   novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive
   state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism
   for generating individual differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Socio-economic status (SES) is a strong determinant of
   eating behavior and the obesity risk.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine which eating and lifestyle behaviors mediate the
   association between SES and obesity.
   METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 318 obese people and 371
   non-obese people in northern France. Ten eating behavior traits were
   assessed using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 21-Item and
   an eating attitude questionnaire (on plate size, the number of servings,
   reasons for stopping eating and the frequency of eating standing up,
   eating in front of the television set (TV) and eating at night). The SES
   score (in three categories) was based on occupation, education and
   income categories. Mediation analysis was performed using the test of
   joint significance and the difference of coefficients test.
   RESULTS: The age-and gender-adjusted obesity risk was higher for
   individuals in the low-SES groups (odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = 1.82 (1.48-2.24), P<0.0001). Additional servings were
   associated with a higher obesity risk (OR = 3.43, P<0.0001). Cognitive
   restraint (P<0.0001) and emotional eating (P<0.0001) scores were higher
   in obese participants than in non-obese participants but did not depend
   on SES. Of the 10 potential factors tested, eating off a large plate (P
   = 0.01), eating at night (P = 0.04) and uncontrolled eating (P = 0.03)
   significantly mediated the relationship between SES and obesity.
   CONCLUSION: Our results highlighted a number of obesogenic behaviors
   among socially disadvantaged participants: large plate size,
   uncontrolled eating and eating at night were significant mediators of
   the relationship between SES and the obesity risk.}},

Abstract = {{Elk (Cervus elaphus) in the western United States are an economically
   and socially valuable wildlife species. They have featured species
   status for federal land management planning; hence, considerable
   modeling focused on habitat evaluation and land management planning has
   been undertaken for elk. The extent to which these and other habitat
   models for large ungulates account for influences of nutritional
   resources varies greatly, probably because of varying recognition of the
   importance of nutrition and uncertainty about how to measure and model
   nutrition. Our primary goals were to 1) develop greater understanding of
   how habitat conditions influence foraging dynamics and nutrition of elk
   in summer and autumn; and 2) illustrate an ecological framework for
   evaluating and predicting nutritional resources so that nutritional
   needs of elk can be integrated within landscape-scale plans, population
   models, and habitat evaluation models.
   We evaluated foraging responses of elk to clearcut logging and
   commercial thinning, forest succession, and season across ecological
   site potentials. We also identified the extent to which plant
   communities satisfied nutritional requirements of lactating female elk
   and their calves. Our study was conducted in the temperate rainforests
   of the Pacific Northwest on industrial and public timberlands. We
   evaluated relations between habitat conditions and elk nutrition in
   plant communities representing a range in stand age and ecological
   conditions at 3 study areas, 1 near the Canadian border in the north
   Cascades Mountains (Nooksack), 1 in the Coast range southwest of
   Olympia, Washington (Willapa Hills), and the third in the central
   Cascades near Springfield, Oregon (Springfield), from late June to
   November, 2000-2002. In 98-143 macroplots per study area, we measured
   forage abundance by plant species, digestible energy content by plant
   life-form group, and forest overstory. In a subset of these macroplots
   (similar to 30 per study area), we held 4 tame lactating elk with calves
   in electrified pens (n = 15-25 adult elk per year), and sampled activity
   budgets, dietary composition, forage selection, and other measures of
   foraging behavior; dietary digestible energy (DE; kcal/g) and protein
   (DP; \%) levels; and intake rates of these nutrients. In 15 of these
   pens, we held elk for extended periods (13-21 days) to monitor changes
   in body fat of adults and growth of calves. We developed equations to
   predict dietary DE and DP and per-minute intake rates of each in a
   nutrition prediction model that reflected vegetation attributes and
   ecological site influences.
   Total abundance of forage in the western hemlock series after clearcut
   logging in low to moderate elevations (<= 1,000 m) ranged from a peak of
   3,000-4,500 kg/ha in 5- to 10-year-old stands to 100-300 kg/ha in 20- to
   50-year-old stands with only moderate increases through late succession.
   Patterns were similar in higher elevation forests (1,000-1,800 m),
   although peaks and troughs in forage abundance developed more slowly.
   Deciduous shrubs, forbs, and graminoids were abundant in early seral
   stages after stand disturbance, but these were rapidly replaced by
   shade-tolerant evergreen shrubs and ferns as conifer overstories closed
   15-20 years later in low-elevation forest zones, and 20-40 years later
   in high-elevation zones. Digestible energy within plant life-form groups
   generally declined with season and with advancing succession, increased
   with elevation, and was highest in forbs and deciduous shrubs and lowest
   in evergreen shrubs and shade-tolerant ferns.
   Levels of DE in elk diets exhibited a strong asymptotic relation with
   abundance (kg/ha) of plant species that were eaten in proportions equal
   to or greater than availability (i.e., accepted species). Marked
   declines in dietary DE occurred in stands containing <400 kg/ha to 500
   kg/ha of accepted species, largely because elk began to increase
   consumption of avoided species, and these typically contained low levels
   of DE. The asymptotic pattern was generally consistent among seasons,
   study areas, and habitat types (potential natural vegetation
   categories), although the asymptote averaged 10-12\% greater in
   high-versus low-elevation forests. Abundance of accepted species in
   early seral stands averaged 7-10 times that in mid and late seral
   stages, and dietary DE levels varied accordingly. Dietary DE was little
   influenced by thinning in 20- to 60-year-old stands. In contrast, levels
   of dietary DP were unrelated to forage composition and abundance of
   accepted or avoided species, and varied little between low and
   high-elevation forests. Dietary DP increased with overstory canopy
   cover, was higher in thinned and hardwood stands, particularly those
   hardwood stands with saturated soils in late summer, declined with
   season, and was lowest in the driest forest communities in our study.
   Overall, soil moisture regime and season accounted for the majority of
   variation in dietary DP.
   Relations between nutrient intake rate and vegetation conditions varied
   among study areas and habitat types. Nevertheless, elk maintained about
   double the intake rate of DE in early seral stages versus closed-canopy
   forests. Intake rate of DP was similar between early seral versus
   closed-canopy forests, despite modestly lower dietary DP in early seral
   stages. Protein intake rate was greater in thinned and hardwood-riparian
   stands. In early seral stages, dietary DE typically met the requirement
   of 2.7 kcal/g of ingested forage (necessary to maintain body fat levels
   of lactating elk in summer) in the low-elevation forest zones and
   exceeded that level in high-elevation forest zones. In closed-canopy
   forests, dietary DE averaged below requirements, markedly so in
   low-elevation forests (2.25-2.5 kcal/g) and moderately so in
   high-elevation forests (2.4-2.65 kcal/g). Evidence of deficiencies based
   on DE intake rate was greater, averaging about 50\% of requirements (28
   kcal/min; 21,000 kcal/day) in closed-canopy forests and 80\% of
   requirements in early seral stages. In contrast, dietary DP and DP
   intake rates generally approached or exceeded estimated requirements
   (6.8\% DP; 380 g/day) in many habitat types that we sampled, with the
   greatest potential for deficient DP intake rates in relatively dry,
   low-elevation forests.
   Body fat dynamics and growth of calves confirmed nutritional
   deficiencies suggested by our data on DE intake. Adult elk lost body fat
   during all trials at rates generally in accordance with expectations at
   the dietary DE levels they consumed, and rate of change in body fat was
   inversely related to abundance of accepted species. Calves grew at about
   half the rate of which they are capable (1 kg/day) if summer nutrition
   is sufficient. Daily calf growth was positively related to their
   mother's dietary DE and protein intake levels.
   Elk compensated for limited foraging options in many plant communities
   via several behavioral strategies. Selection was generally strong for
   plants with higher DE levels, where selected species composed nearly 5
   times more of the diet than did species that elk avoided, yet avoided
   species were 10 times more abundant. As abundance of accepted species
   declined below approximately 400 kg/ha, elk increased intake of avoided
   species. This strategy delayed declines in per-minute forage and DE
   intake rate as long as abundance of accepted species remained above
   roughly 200 kg/ha, despite declining dietary DE levels apparent at <400
   kg/ha to 500 kg/ha of accepted species. Elk traveled faster while
   foraging to compensate for plant communities with very low abundance of
   total forage, increased bite rate as bite mass declined, increased time
   spent feeding at night in pens with low abundance of total forage or
   relatively low dietary DE levels, and increased rumination time
   particularly as dietary fiber levels increased. Dietary DE, DP, and
   intake rates of these nutrients therefore were robust to substantial
   variation in overall forage quality and quantity. Nevertheless, these
   strategies were insufficient to compensate for low abundance of
   high-quality forage typically present under closed forest canopies.
   Our nutrition model included nonlinear and multiple regression equations
   to predict 1) dietary DE (kcal/g of ingested forage), based primarily on
   abundance of accepted species (r(2) = 0.49-0.62); and 2) dietary DP (\%
   of ingested forage), based primarily on abundance of accepted species,
   overstory canopy cover, and site characteristics intended to index soil
   moisture (r(2) = 0.60). Additional equations to predict intake rates per
   minute included the same covariates, but the variance explained was
   modestly lower (DE intake: r(2) = 0.43; DP intake: r(2) = 0.45-0.54).
   With these equations, we created nutrition-succession profiles to
   illustrate dietary DE and DP intake dynamics across the successional
   sequence for each habitat type and study area. These profiles may serve
   as inputs for spatially explicit maps of nutritional resources for elk.
   Because they were developed using nutrition data from foraging elk, they
   should help alleviate much of the uncertainty arising from proxy
   variables often used as indices of nutritional resources.
   Our data demonstrated that nutritional resources in forests of western
   Oregon and Washington are generally deficient for lactating elk in
   summer and early autumn. They provided evidence that inadequate
   nutritional resources are largely responsible for low body fat in autumn
   and reduced pregnancy rates reported for many elk herds in the Pacific
   Northwest. Our data also illustrated that nutritional value of habitats
   is highly variable depending on ecological context, disturbance, and
   succession. Thus, how, if, and where forested elk habitats are managed
   can greatly influence the nutritional suitability of an area. Finally,
   our data indicate a considerable need for integrating nutritional
   assessments in landscape planning processes where maintaining abundant
   and productive elk populations is one of several forest management goals
   in the Pacific Northwest. (C) 2016 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Many neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by
   deficits in cognitive flexibility. Modeling cognitive flexibility in
   mice enables the investigation of mechanisms underlying these deficits.
   The majority of currently available behavioral tests targeting this
   cognitive domain are reversal learning tasks that require scheduled food
   restriction, extended training periods and labor-intensive, and
   stress-inducing animal handling. Here, we describe a novel 4-day (4-d)
   continuously running task measuring discrimination-and reversal learning
   in an automated home cage (CognitionWall DL/RL task) that largely
   eliminates these limitations. In this task, mice can earn unlimited
   number of food rewards by passing through the correct hole of the
   three-holed CognitionWall. To assess the validity and sensitivity of
   this novel task, the performance of C57BL/6J mice, amyloid precursor
   protein/presenilin1 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice, a-calmodulin kinase-II
   (aCaMKII) T305D knock-in mice, and mice with an orbitofrontal cortex
   lesion were examined. We found that C57BL/6J mice reach stable
   performance levels within the 4 d of the task, while experiencing only
   slight reductions in weight and no major effects on circadian rhythm.
   The task detected learning deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic and aCaMKII
   T305D mutant mice. Additionally, we established that the orbitofrontal
   cortex underlies reversal learning performance in our task. Because of
   its short duration and the absence of food deprivation and concurrent
   weight loss, this novel automated home-cage task substantially improves
   comprehensive preclinical assessment of cognitive functions in mouse
   models of psychiatric and neurological disorders and also enables
   analysis during specific developmental stages.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the following hypotheses were explored using zebrafish
   Danio rerio: (1) individuals from the same cohort differ consistently in
   activity and risk-taking and (2) variation in activity and risk-taking
   is linked to individual differences in metabolic rate, body length and
   body condition. To examine these hypotheses, juvenile D. rerio were
   tested for routine metabolic rate and subsequently exposed to an open
   field test. Strong evidence was found for consistent among-individual
   differences in activity and risk-taking, which were overall negatively
   correlated with body length, i.e. larger D. rerio were found to be less
   active in a potentially dangerous open field and a similar trend was
   found with respect to a more direct measure of their risk-taking
   tendency. In contrast, routine metabolic rate and body condition were
   uncorrelated with both activity and risk-taking of juvenile D. rerio.
   These findings suggest that body length is associated with risk-related
   behaviours in juvenile D. rerio for which larger, rather than smaller,
   individuals may have a higher risk of predation, while the role for
   routine metabolic rate is relatively limited or non-existent, at least
   under the conditions of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Depressive disorders cause a substantial burden for the individual and
   the society. Key depressive symptoms can be modeled in animals and
   enable the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Chronic
   unavoidable stress disrupts rats' competence to escape noxious stimuli
   and self-administer sucrose, configuring a depression model
   characterized by escape deficit and motivational anhedonia associated to
   impaired dopaminergic responses to sucrose in the nucleus accumbens
   shell (NAcS). Repeated treatments that restore these responses also
   relieve behavioral symptoms. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine
   neurons encode reward and motivation and are implicated in the
   neuropathology of depressive-like behaviors. Peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors type-alpha (PPAR alpha) acutely
   regulate VTA dopamine neuron firing via beta 2 subunit-containing
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (beta 2{*}nAChRs) through
   phosphorylation and this effect is predictive of antidepressant-like
   effects.
   Here, by combining behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical
   techniques, we studied the effects of repeated PPARa. stimulation by
   fenofibrate on mesolimbic dopamine system. We found decreased beta
   2{*}nAChRs phosphorylation levels and a switch from tonic to phasic
   activity of dopamine cells in the VTA, and increased phosphorylation of
   dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) in the
   NAcS. We then investigated whether long-term fenofibrate administration
   to stressed rats reinstated the decreased DARPP-32 response to sucrose
   and whether this effect translated into antidepressant-like properties.
   Fenofibrate restored dopaminergic responses to appetitive stimuli,
   reactivity to aversive stimuli and motivation to self-administer
   sucrose. Overall, this study suggests PPARa as new targets for
   antidepressant therapies endowed with motivational anti-anhedonic
   properties, further supporting the role of an unbalanced mesolimbic
   dopamine system in pathophysiology of depressive disorders. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Variation in state, which is any factor that alters the value of
   decision options, is likely one of the most common drivers of
   personality differences. However, the general relationship between
   individuals' body state and various personality metrics/average
   behavioral type, repeatability of behavior, and behavioral syndrome
   structure is still poorly resolved. Here, we manipulate body condition
   in three spider species (Agelenopsis aperta, Latrodectus hesperus, and
   Anelosimus studiosus) using contrasting feeding schedules. We then
   assessed the effects of historic feeding regime on individuals' body
   condition, boldness, and foraging aggressiveness. We further assessed
   the effects of feeding regimes on the repeatability of boldness and
   aggressiveness and the presence/absence of correlations between these
   two traits. We found that feeding treatment impacted individuals'
   average boldness and aggressiveness in two species (A. aperta and A.
   studiosus). We also noted that among-individual variance in both
   boldness and aggressiveness was severely reduced when A. aperta and A.
   studiosus were subjected to prolonged food restriction, steeply reducing
   repeatability in these traits. Finally, we noted that correlations
   between boldness and foraging aggressiveness were detectable only in one
   case, revealing no compelling relationship between food restriction and
   the presence/absence of behavioral correlations. Taken together, our
   results suggest that food restriction has only weak, circumstantial
   effects on individuals' average personality type and the correlations
   between behavioral traits. However, there appears to be a robust
   positive relationship between food availability and the signature of
   consistent individual differences in behavior.
   Under laboratory conditions, we found that lower feeding rates sharply
   decreased the repeatability of aggressiveness and boldness in two spider
   species. In doing so, we provide the second body of evidence suggesting
   that a highly prevalent and ecologically relevant state variable, higher
   body condition, can increase the repeatability of foraging-related
   behavioral traits. Additionally, under some feeding regimes, we found
   that hunger levels could alter the average individual aggressiveness and
   boldness but not correlations between these traits. This work highlights
   the importance of state variables such as hunger in eroding behavioral
   repeatability, the defining trait of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report regioselectively functionalized synthesis, as well as
   photo physical, electrochemical, and thermal, of a novel water-soluble
   conjugated polymer. For this purpose, horseradish peroxidase
   (HRP)-catalyzed polymerization of a multifunctional monomer,
   7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid (AHNAPSA) was carried out
   by using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant at room temperature for 24 h
   under air. The structure of poly(7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene
   sulfonic acid), (PAHNAPSA) was identified by using nuclear magnetic
   resonance, infrared and ultraviolet-visible. Further characterization
   was performed by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
   thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), photoluminescence (PL), dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and solid state conductivity measurements. The spectral analysis results
   exhibited functional group selective polymerization of the monomer
   containing a multi-active center. Solvent effects on the optical,
   electrochemical and photo physical properties of PAHNAPSA were
   investigated by using five different solvents. PAHNAPSA presented an
   irreversible redox characterization at different scan rates. Optical
   band gap of PAHNAPSA is also found in the range of 3.18 eV to 3.55 eV.
   The fluorescence measurements were utilized to investigate the
   photochemical behaviors of PAHNAPSA in selected polar solvents.
   Accordingly, PAHNAPSA surprisingly presented multicolor emission
   behavior with relatively high quantum yield in all selected solvents. In
   addition, PAHNAPSA presented a reversible pH-responsive behavior and
   also had high selectivity and sensitivity towards chromium ions.
   Finally, the kinetic parameters associated with the solid state thermal
   degradation of PAHNAPSA were calculated from isoconversional methods.
   The TG/DTG analysis showed that PAHNAPSA followed a diffusion controlled
   degradation mechanism in N-2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The human dopamine D4 receptor (hD(4)R) variants with long tandem
   repeats in the third intracellular loop have been strongly associated
   with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and risk taking
   behaviors. To understand the potential molecular mechanism underlying
   the connection, we have investigated the synaptic function of human D4R
   polymorphism by virally expressing the ADHD-linked 7-repeat allele,
   hD4.7, or its normal counterpart, hD4.4, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   of D4R knockout mice. We found that hD(4)R bound to the SH3 domain of
   PSD-95 in a state-dependent manner. Activation of hD4.7 caused more
   reduction of NR1/PSD-95 binding and NR1 surface expression than hD4.4 in
   PFC slices. Moreover, the NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic
   currents (NMDAR-EPSC) in PFC pyramidal neurons were suppressed to a
   larger extent by hD4.7 than hD4.4 activation. Direct stimulation of
   NMDARs with the partial agonist D-cycloserine prevented the NMDAR
   hypofunction induced by hD4.7 activation. Moreover, hD4.7-expressing
   mice exhibited the increased exploratory and novelty seeking behaviors,
   mimicking the phenotypic hallmark of human ADHD. D-cydoserine
   administration ameliorated the ADHD-like behaviors in hD4.7-expressing
   mice. Our results suggest that over suppression of NMDAR function may
   underlie the role of hD4.7 in ADHD, and enhancing NMDAR signaling may be
   a viable therapeutic strategy to ADHD humans carrying the D4.7 allele.

Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ecological and evolutionary model organisms have provided
   extensive insight into the ecological triggers, adaptive benefits, and
   evolution of life-history driven developmental plasticity. Despite this,
   we still have a poor understanding of the underlying genetic changes
   that occur during shifts towards different developmental trajectories.
   The goal of this study is to determine whether we can identify
   underlying gene expression patterns that can describe the different
   life-history trajectories individuals follow in response to social cues
   of competition. To do this, we use the Australian black field cricket
   (Teleogryllus commodus), a species with sex-specific developmental
   trajectories moderated by the density and quality of calls heard during
   immaturity. In this study, we manipulated the social information males
   and females could hear by rearing individuals in either calling or
   silent treatments. We next used RNA-Seq to develop a reference
   transcriptome to study changes in brain gene expression at two points
   prior to sexual maturation.
   Results: We show accelerated development in both sexes when exposed to
   calling; changes were also seen in growth, lifespan, and reproductive
   effort. Functional relationships between genes and phenotypes were
   apparent from ontological enrichment analysis. We demonstrate that
   increased investment towards traits such as growth and reproductive
   effort were often associated with the expression of a greater number of
   genes with similar effect, thus providing a suite of candidate genes for
   future research in this and other invertebrate organisms.
   Conclusions: Our results provide interesting insight into the genomic
   underpinnings of developmental plasticity and highlight the potential of
   a genomic exploration of other evolutionary theories such as condition
   dependence and sex-specific developmental strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Internal states can profoundly alter the behavior of animals. A
   quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic
   challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain
   nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to
   characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape
   exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult Drosophila
   melanogaster. We find that these two states have specific effects on the
   decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore,
   the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation
   trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while
   satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction
   mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein
   source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to
   mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal
   nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of
   exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection.}},

Title = {{Energy state affects exploratory behavior of tree sparrows in a group
   context under differential food-patch distributions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: When facing a novel situation, animals can retreat or leave
   to avoid risks, but will miss potential resources and opportunities.
   Alternatively they may reduce environmental uncertainty by exploration,
   while risking no energy rewards and exposure to hazards, and use the
   information retrieved for subsequent decision making. When exploring,
   however, animals may adopt different tactics according to individual
   states.
   Results: We tested that energy states will affect exploratory behavior
   by experimenting with wild-caught untrained Eurasian tree sparrows
   (Passer montanus) in fasted or fed states exploring in a novel space
   with hidden food supply in different patch distribution patterns. Our
   data revealed that fasted sparrows risked being earlier explorers more
   often, initiated more exploratory bouts before patches were found, and
   stayed longer on the ground under both patch patterns. Fasted sparrows
   discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in
   dispersed, but not necessary so in clumped, patch patterns; whereas fed
   birds also increased patch finding to a certain level in dispersed
   patterns. Sparrows of both energy states, however, did not differ in
   feeding rates in either patch pattern.
   Conclusions: Exploratory behavior of tree sparrows is state-dependent,
   which supports our prediction that birds with an energy shortage will be
   risk-prone and explore more readily. Our study also indicates a game
   nature of tree sparrow exploratory behavior in a group context when
   explorers are in different energy states and are exposed to different
   patch distributions. Birds of lower energy state adopting an active
   exploring tactic may be favored by obtaining higher energy gains in
   dispersed patch patterns with lower patch richness. More satiated birds,
   however, achieved a similar feeding rate by lowered exposure time.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{217-222}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The prevalence of consistent among-individual differences in behaviour,
   or personality, makes adaptive sense if individuals differ in stable
   state variables that shift the balance between the costs and benefits of
   their behavioural decisions. These differences may give rise to both
   individual differences in, and covariance among, behaviours that
   influence an individual's exposure to risks. We here study the link
   between behaviour and a candidate state variable previously overlooked
   in the study of state-dependent personality variation: telomere length.
   Telomeres are the protective endcaps of chromosomes and their erosion
   with age is thought to play a crucial role in regulating organismal
   senescence and intrinsic lifespan. Following evidence that shorter
   telomeres may reduce the lifespan of animals in a wide range of taxa, we
   predict individuals with shorter telomeres to behave more boldly and
   aggressively. In order to test this, we measured telomere length and
   behaviour in wild juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). We found
   individuals with shorter fin telomeres to behave consistently more
   boldly and aggressively under controlled conditions in the laboratory.
   No such relationship was found with muscle telomere length 3-4 months
   after the behavioural assays. We suggest that telomere dynamics are an
   important factor integrating personality traits with other state
   variables thought to be important in the regulation of behaviour, such
   as metabolism, disease resistance and growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

   The present study aimed to explore patients' preferences for diet and

   satisfaction with the consultation process impacted on participants'
   experience, including the dietitian's CD expertise, consistency of the

Abstract = {{Birds' responses to human disturbance are interesting due to their
   similarities to anti-predator behaviour, and understanding this
   behaviour has practical applications for conservation management by
   informing measures such as buffer zones to protect priority species. To
   understand better the costs of disturbance and whether it will impact on
   population size, studies should quantify time-related responses as well
   as the more commonly reported flight initiation distance (FID). Using
   waders wintering on an estuarine area, we experimentally disturbed
   foraging birds on the Wash Embayment, UK, by walking towards them and
   recording their responses (FID, alert time, time spent in flight, time
   taken to resume feeding, and total feeding time lost). We present data
   for 10 species of conservation concern: Curlew Numenius arquata,
   Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica,
   Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Redshank Tringa totanus, Knot Calidris
   canutus, Turnstone Arenaria interpres, Ringed Plover Charadrius

   species responded more strongly, response magnitude was greater under
   milder environmental conditions, and responses varied over both small
   and large spatial scales. The energetic costs of individual responses,
   however, were low relative to daily requirements and disturbance events
   were unlikely to be frequent enough to seriously limit foraging time. We
   suggest, therefore, that wintering wader populations on the Wash are not
   currently significantly negatively impacted by human disturbance during
   the intertidal foraging period. This is also likely to be the case at
   other estuarine sites with comparable access levels, visitor patterns,
   invertebrate food availability and environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Non-breeding Cackling Branta hutchinsii, Ross's Anser rossii and Lesser
   Snow Geese Anser caerulescens caerulescens captured during remigial

   captured geese of all three species were likely to have been

   obtain sufficient exogenous energy to meet their needs during the
   flightless wing moult period without losing body mass. This also is
   consistent with the hypothesis that in other species of geese,
   accumulation of fat stores prior to, and depletion of such stores
   during, wing moult is adaptive and likely to be a feature of individual
   plasticity to meet particular needs, such as undertaking moult migration
   to remote sites where precise foraging and predation conditions cannot
   be anticipated, or where competition from more dominant individuals may
   restrict their access to a reliable food supply.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Food fussiness (FF), or the frequent rejection of both
   familiar and unfamiliar foods, is common among children and, given its
   link to poor diet quality, may contribute to the onset and/or
   maintenance of childhood obesity. This study examined child FF in
   association with anthropometric variables and diet in children with
   overweight/obesity participating in family-based behavioral weight loss
   treatment (FBT). Change in FF was assessed in relation to FBT outcome,
   including whether change in diet quality mediated the relation between
   change in FF and change in child weight.
   Methods: Child (N=170; age=9.41 +/- 1.23) height and weight were
   measured, and parents completed FF questionnaires and three 24-h recalls
   of child diet at baseline and post-treatment. Healthy Eating Index-2005
   scores were calculated.
   Results: At baseline, child FF was related to lower vegetable intake.
   Average child FF decreased from start to end of FBT. Greater decreases
   in FF were associated with greater reductions in child body mass index
   and improved overall diet quality. Overall, diet quality change through
   FBT mediated the relation between child FF change and child body mass
   index change.
   Conclusions: Children with high FF can benefit from FBT, and addressing
   FF may be important in childhood obesity treatment to maximize weight
   outcomes.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Predators can have powerful nonconsumptive effects on their prey by
   inducing behavioral, physiological, and morphological responses. These
   nonconsumptive effects may influence prey demography if they decrease
   birthrates or increase susceptibility to other sources of mortality. The
   Reproductive Suppression Model suggests that iteroparous species may
   maximize their lifetime reproductive success by suppressing their
   reproduction until a future time, when conditions may be more favorable.
   Coyote (Canis latrans) range expansion in the United States has exposed
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations to increased
   predation risk, and coyote predation can have profound effects on
   white-tailed deer reproductive success. We evaluated effects of temporal
   variation in predation risk (i.e., coyote-deer ratios) on fecundity and
   reproductive success of white-tailed deer on the Joseph W. Jones
   Ecological Research Center in southwestern Georgia, United States, by
   exploiting a rapid decline in coyote abundance to establish a natural
   experiment. We measured fecundity by examining ovaries for evidence of
   ovulation, and measured reproductive success using evidence of lactation
   from deer harvested before and after the decline in coyote abundance. We
   found that incidence of ovulation and lactation increased following the
   decline in predation risk. Our results suggest coyotes may be able to
   influence deer recruitment, independent of direct predation, through
   interactions that result in reduced fecundity. More broadly, our study
   suggests that in order to understand the totality of the effect of
   predators on prey population dynamics, studies should incorporate
   measures of direct and indirect predator effects.}},

Abstract = {{Animals face stressful situations to which they can respond by mounting
   a physiological response. Few studies have compared the relative effects
   of two or more stressors on this response. We compared how low food
   abundance and hunting affected levels of fecal glucocorticoid
   metabolites (FGM), an indicator of stress, in Sitka black-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada).
   We monitored monthly FGM levels over a year on three islands: on two,
   there was no hunting but deer were exposed to increased risk of severe
   food depletion; and on one, deer had access to abundant food but were
   exposed to a few days of hunting each year. Based on the context of the
   study, we tentatively predicted that FGM levels would be higher in low
   food abundance/safe islands. We also predicted that FGM levels would be
   higher in winter when food is rarer, particularly in low food
   abundance/safe islands. The three deer populations presented similar
   average FGM levels and seasonal variations. Our predictions were
   therefore not supported. Our results rather suggested that environmental
   contrasts, perceived by us as large (increased risk of starvation on ELI
   and Kunga islands) or associated with differences in animal behavior
   (human avoidance on Reef island), did not lead to increased stress
   responses. We discuss plausible explanations, including the
   down-regulation of the stress response in depleted environments and the
   lack of stress response to low hunting pressure when behavioral
   responses to risk are unlikely to be costly.}},

Abstract = {{Historical patterns of wildfires are being altered as a result of
   changing climate and therefore are becoming an increasingly pressing
   global issue. How small mammals deal physiologically with changes in
   landscape and food availability due to fire remains largely unknown,
   although recent studies on small heterothermic terrestrial mammals have
   shown an increase in post-fire torpor use to reduce energy and foraging
   requirements. However, data on the behavioural and physiological
   responses of bats after fires are scarce, although potentially these
   volant species may differ from terrestrial mammals. Therefore, we
   investigated the post-fire thermal biology and activity of lesser
   long-eared bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) using temperature-telemetry in
   Warrumbungle National Park, NSW, which experienced a devastating
   wildfire in 2013. The study comprised two field seasons, one in 2013
   within 4 months after the fire, and one in 2015 two years after the fire
   to identify potential changes in behaviour and physiology.
   Interestingly, soon after the fire, bats showed significantly shorter
   torpor bout duration (11.8 +/- A 12.5 h) and longer normothermia
   duration (8.7 +/- A 4.6 h) in comparison to those in 2015 (torpor bout
   duration: 24.1 +/- A 23.5 h; normothermia duration: 2.5 +/- A 1.5 h).
   Insect availability was significantly (20-fold) higher in 2013 than in
   2015, which was likely an important factor resulting in the short
   average torpor bout duration by N. geoffroyi after the fire. Our data
   indicate that volant bats appear to show the opposite post-fire
   behavioural and physiological responses to small terrestrial mammals,
   showing longer normothermic and active periods and shorter torpor bouts
   to capitalise on an increase in available post-fire resources.}},

   the quota severity and the utilization of the optimal strategy, shedding
   light on the neural substrates of the quota-dependent risk attitude. Our

Title = {{Do great tits (Parus major) suppress basal metabolic rate in response to
   increased perceived predation danger? A field experiment}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{164}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{400-406}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that individuals with higher metabolic rates
   (MRs) feed at higher rates and are more willing to forage in the
   presence of predators. This increases the acquisition of resources,
   which in turn, may help to sustain a higher MR. Elevated predation
   danger may be expected to result in reduced MRs, either as a means of
   allowing for reduced feeding and risk-taking, or as a consequence of
   adaptively reducing intake rates via reduced feeding and/or risk-taking.
   We tested this prediction in free-living great tits (Parus major) using
   a playback experiment to manipulate perceived predation danger. There
   was evidence that changes in body mass and BMR differed as a function of
   treatment. In predator treatment plots, great tits tended to reduce
   their body mass, a commonly observed response in birds to increased
   predation danger. In contrast, birds from control treatment plots showed
   no overall changes in body mass. There was also evidence that great tits
   from control treatment plots increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR)
   over the course of the experiment, presumably due to decreasing ambient
   temperatures over the study period. However, there was no evidence for
   changes in BMR for birds from predator treatment plots. Although the
   directions of these results are consistent with the predicted directions
   of effects, the effects sizes and confidence intervals yield
   inconclusive support for the hypothesis that great tits would adaptively
   suppress BMR in response to increased perceived predation risk. The
   effect size observed in the present study was small (similar to 1\%) and
   would not be expected to result in substantive reductions in feeding
   rate and/or risk-taking. Whether or not ecological conditions that
   generate greater energetic stress (e.g. lower food availability, lower
   ambient temperatures) could produce an effect that produces biologically
   meaningful reductions in feeding activity and/or risk-taking remains an
   open question. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The first 2 years of life is a critical period of rapid
   growth and brain development. During this period, nutrition and
   environmental factors play important roles in growth and cognitive
   development of a child. This report describes the study protocol of
   early nutrition, growth and cognitive development of infants from birth
   to 2 years of age.
   Methods/Design: This is a prospective cohort study of mothers and
   infants recruited from government health clinics in Seremban district in
   Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Infants are followed-up at 6, 12, 18 and 24
   months of age. Pre-natal factors that include mother's pre-pregnancy
   body mass index, gestational weight gain, blood glucose and blood
   pressure during pregnancy, infant's gestational age, birth weight and
   head circumference at birth are obtained from patient card. Post-natal
   factors assessed at each follow-up are feeding practices, dietary
   intake, anthropometric measurements and cognitive development of
   infants. Iron status is assessed at 6 months, while infant temperament
   and home environment are assessed at 12 months. Maternal intelligence is
   assessed at 18 months.
   Discussion: Early life nutritional programming is of current interest as
   many longitudinal studies are actively being conducted in developed
   countries to investigate this concept. The concept however is relatively
   new in developing countries such as Malaysia. This study will provide
   useful information on early nutrition and infant development in the
   first two years of life which can be further followed up to identify
   factors that track into childhood and contribute to growth and cognitive
   deviations.}},

Abstract = {{The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a
   phloem-feeding insect whose antipredator defenses include kicking,
   walking away, and dropping from the plant. Aphid dropping, a risky and
   energetically costly antipredator behavior, can be increased by the
   release of aphid alarm pheromone; there is also evidence that insect
   density and plant health can affect the likelihood of aphids engaging in
   this behavior. We investigated whether interactions between alarm cues,
   insect density, and plant health can alter the dropping behavior of
   aphids in response to an artificial disturbance. The presence of the
   alarm pheromone E-beta-farnesene resulted in a nearly 15-fold increase
   in aphid dropping behavior; the other two factors, however, did not
   affect dropping and none of the two-or three-way interactions were
   significant. This was surprising because aphids affected plant health:
   production of new plant biomass after 5 d of exposure to high aphid
   densities was 50\% lower than in the control treatment. This research
   adds to our understanding of the factors affecting aphid antipredator
   behavior; the fact that neither aphid density nor feeding period
   impacted dropping may reflect the high energetic costs of this activity
   and an unwillingness to use it in any but the riskiest situations.}},

Abstract = {{Stress responses are suggested to physiologically underlie parental

   Besides this classical view, the ``brood-value hypothesis{''} suggests

   brood is high. Here, we test the brood-value hypothesis in breeding king

   a progressive increase in NEFA plasma levels in courting birds suggested

Abstract = {{Background
   The purpose of this study was to examine weight loss, physical activity,
   fitness and diet changes in response to a standard behavioral weight
   loss intervention in adults with self-reported juvenile onset (n = 61)
   or adult onset (n = 116) obesity.
   Methods
   Participants (n = 177; 43.0 +/- 8.6 years; body mass index {[}BMI] =
   33.0 +/- 3.4 kg m(-2)) engaged in an 18-month standard behavioral weight
   loss intervention. Participants were randomized into three different
   intervention groups as part of the larger parent trial. BMI, physical
   activity, fitness and diet were assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 18
   months. Separate adjusted mixed models were constructed using SAS
   version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
   Results
   There was significant weight loss, increased physical activity, improved
   fitness and reduced caloric intake over time (p<0.001). There were no
   significant differences in these outcome variables by obesity onset
   group. However, there was a significant group by time interaction for
   fitness (p = 0.001), with the adult onset making significantly greater
   gains in fitness from baseline to 6 months (p<0.001); however, this
   difference was no longer present at 12 or 18 months.
   Conclusions
   With the exception of fitness at 6 months, weight loss, physical
   activity and diet did not differ between juvenile onset and adult onset
   participants, suggesting that those with juvenile onset obesity are
   equally responsive to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in
   adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) and National Centre
   for the Replacement, Refinement \& Reduction of Animals in Research
   (NC3Rs) conducted a survey and workshop in 2015 to define current
   industry practices relating to housing of non-rodents during telemetry
   recordings in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. The aim was to
   share experiences, canvas opinion on the study procedures/designs that
   could be used and explore the barriers to social housing.
   Methods: Thirty-nine sites, either running studies (Sponsors or Contract
   Research Organisations, CROs) and/or outsourcing work responded to the
   survey (51\% from Europe; 41\% from USA).
   Results: During safety pharmacology studies, 84, 67 and 100\% of
   respondents socially house dogs, minipigs and non-human primates (NHPs)
   respectively on non-recording days. However, on recording days 20, 20
   and 33\% of respondents socially house the animals, respectively. The
   main barriers for social housing were limitations in the recording
   equipment used, study design and animal temperament/activity. During
   toxicology studies, 94, 100 and 100\% of respondents socially house
   dogs, minipigs and NHPs respectively on non-recording days. However, on
   recording days 31, 25 and 50\% of respondents socially house the
   animals, respectively. The main barriers for social housing were risk of
   damage to and limitations in the recording equipment used, food
   consumption recording and temperament/activity of the animals.
   Conclusions: Although the majority of the industry does not yet socially
   house animals during telemetry recordings in safety pharmacology and
   toxicology studies, there is support to implement this refinement.
   Continued discussions, sharing of best practice and data from companies
   already socially housing, combined with technology improvements and
   investments in infrastructure are required to maintain the forward
   momentum of this refinement across the industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The sexes differ in how and when they allocate energy towards
   reproduction, but how this influences phenotypic plasticity in daily
   activity patterns is unclear. Here, we use collar-mounted light loggers
   and triaxial accelerometers to examine factors that affect time spent
   above ground and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), an index of
   activity-specific energy expenditure, across the active season of
   free-living, semi-fossorial arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus
   parryii). We found high day-to-day variability in time spent above
   ground and ODBA with most of the variance explained by environmental
   conditions known to affect thermal exchange. In both years, females
   spent more time below ground compared with males during parturition and
   early lactation; however, this difference was fourfold larger in the
   second year, possibly, because females were in better body condition.
   Daily ODBA positively correlated with time spent above ground in both
   sexes, but females were more active per unit time above ground.
   Consequently, daily ODBA did not differ between the sexes when
   femaleswere early in lactation, even though females were above ground
   three to six fewer hours each day. Further, on top of having the
   additional burden of milk production, ODBA data indicate females also
   had fragmented rest patterns and were more active during late lactation.
   Our results indicate that sex differences in reproductive requirements
   can have a substantial influence on activity patterns, but the size of
   this effect may be dependent on capital resources accrued during
   gestation.}},

Abstract = {{Conifer bark beetles attack and kill mature spruce and pine trees,
   especially during hot and dry conditions. These beetles are closely
   associated with ophiostomatoid fungi of the Ascomycetes, including the
   genera Ophiostoma, Grosmannia, and Endoconidiophora, which enhance
   beetle success by improving nutrition and modifying their substrate, but
   also have negative impacts on beetles by attracting predators and
   parasites. A survey of the literature and our own data revealed that
   ophiostomatoid fungi emit a variety of volatile organic compounds under
   laboratory conditions including fusel alcohols, terpenoids, aromatic
   compounds, and aliphatic alcohols. Many of these compounds already have
   been shown to elicit behavioral responses from bark beetles, functioning
   as attractants or repellents, often as synergists to compounds currently
   used in bark beetle control. Thus, these compounds could serve as
   valuable new agents for bark beetle management. However, bark beetle
   associations with fungi are very complex. Beetle behavior varies with
   the species of fungus, the stage of the beetle life cycle, the host tree
   quality, and probably with changes in the emission rate of fungal
   volatiles. Additional research on bark beetles and their symbiotic
   associates is necessary before the basic significance of ophiostomatoid
   fungal volatiles can be understood and their applied potential realized.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and evolutionary processes commonly result in morphological
   variation among larval amphibians. Variation in head shape plays a
   critical role in both food capture and predation risk in gape-limited
   salamanders, yet in situ studies of head shape variability are rare
   outside of cannibal morph assessments. We examined allometry differences
   in larval head width (HW) and snout-vent length (SVL) among three
   sympatric species of ambystomatid salamanders from 166 ponds in
   Missouri, USA: Ringed Salamander (Ambystoma annulatum), Marbled
   Salamander (A. opacum), and Spotted Salamander (A. maculatum). We also
   tested whether several abiotic and biotic factors would predict HW after
   accounting for SVL. We found that larval HW and SVL were strongly
   correlated for all species but that the strength of this relationship
   varied among species. For early-stage larvae, Marbled Salamanders showed
   isometric scaling relationships, whereas both Spotted Salamanders and
   Ringed Salamanders were allometric. For late-stage larvae, all three
   species showed allometric patterns. At a small SVL, HW of small Ringed
   Salamanders was greater than the other species. As larvae increased in
   SVL, Marbled Salamander HW increased most rapidly and eventually
   exceeded both Ringed Salamanders and Spotted Salamanders of a similar
   size. We also found that both abiotic and biotic factors predicted
   significant differences in HW corrected for SVL among species, including
   predator density, competitor density, and hydroperiod. Overall,
   variability in scaling relationships may provide ecological advantages
   to each species at different points in ontogeny and different biotic and
   abiotic factors may induce such variation in asymmetric ways among
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental constraints are strong in migratory species that breed in
   the Arctic. In addition to breeding, Anatidae have to renew all their
   flight feathers during the short arctic summer. We examine how temporal
   constraints and climate affect the phenology of flight feather moult in
   the greater snow goose Chen caerulescens atlantica, a High Arctic
   nesting species. We used a database of 1412 moulting adult females
   measured over 15 yr on Bylot Island, Nunavut. Ninth (9th) primary length
   was used to determine the moult stage and speed of feather growth. We
   found a positive relationship between median annual hatching and moult
   initiation dates and the slope did not differ from 1. The interval
   between hatching and moult initiation was thus rather fixed and geese
   did not initiate moult earlier when reproductive phenology was delayed.
   Nonetheless, there was no relationship between median hatching date and
   the date at which birds regained flight capacity, suggesting that date
   of end of moult is independent of the reproductive phenology. There was
   a trend for an increase in the speed of flight feather growth in years
   with delayed hatching date. This is the most likely mechanism that could
   explain moult phenology adjustment in this species. Finally, we found a
   positive relationship between 9th primary length (corrected for
   inter-annual variations) and body condition, suggesting a delay in
   moulting for individuals in poor condition. These results suggest that
   moult plasticity is primarily governed by variations in feather growth
   speed. This phenotypic plasticity could be necessary to complete flight
   feather renewal before the end of the arctic summer, independently of
   reproductive phenology and spring environmental conditions. Our novel
   results suggest possible phenological adjustments through moult speed,
   which was considered constant in geese until now.}},

Abstract = {{Following bacterial infection spreads in a population, individuals show
   fitness variation or plasticity based on their genotypes, the
   environmental stress and the interaction of both factors. Drosophila
   melanogaster-bacterial pathogen system was used to unravel how
   fitness-divergent isofemale (homogeneous) lines and experimental
   population (heterogeneous) react to infection under standard and
   restricted diets. Life-history traits and fecundity of D. melanogaster
   were assessed under healthy and disease conditions. Marked differences
   were observed between half of the Drosophila lines and the heterogeneous
   population. Diet change failed to induce significant differences of
   survival percentage and development time in all lines, indicating lack
   of phenotypic plasticity under healthy conditions. However, following
   bacterial infection, the significant differences among the Drosophila
   life-history traits due to lines and bacterial strains demonstrated
   phenotypic plasticity and genotype-by- environment interaction on
   standard diet. By combining the two environmental factors (diet regime
   and treatment) together with the lines, D. melanogaster showed
   significant difference of the survival percentage due to Pectobacterium
   carotovorum infection. Interestingly, Drosophila fecundity was affected
   by genotype, diet and treatment. The fecundity showed a general
   reduction following infection or diet restriction exposure. The results
   of reaction norms of Drosophila survival percentage, development time
   and fecundity demonstrated that the isofemale lines were more plastic
   than the heterogeneous population under the range of environments
   tested. The obtained results give evidence that the fitness plasticity
   is considered an important mechanism to help the homogeneous populations
   to survive the harsh environmental circumstances, whereas the phenotypic
   variation of the heterogeneous populations is considered the major one.}},

Abstract = {{Information on where to find food patches, their quality, and food
   variance can have implications for fitness and survival when a current
   food patch fails. Individuals have been found to vary in their response
   to changes in food availability, and this has been related to several
   personality traits in animals such as exploration behavior that measures
   activity in a novel environment. We examined if personality-related
   variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by
   information-gathering strategies (IGSs), where individuals vary in
   investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new
   patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an
   alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express
   variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted
   that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current
   information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we
   designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to
   changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits Parus
   major). We found that slow exploring individuals sampled empty food
   patches more than fast exploring individuals, supporting the IGS
   hypothesis. We found no evidence for personality-related differences in

Abstract = {{Different phenological responses to climate changes by species

   functionally dependent components of an ecosystem, with important
   effects on its structure and functioning. Here, we investigate
   within-season variation in zooplankton availability, chick diet
   composition and breeding performance of a small planktivorous seabird,
   the little auk (Alle alle) in two large colonies in Hornsund and
   Magdalenefjorden, Spitsbergen, differing in synchrony of breeding
   (11-day vs. 22-day hatching period, respectively). Assuming similar
   zooplankton phenology and existing differences in duration of the little
   auk breeding period, we expected lower availability of the preferred
   food in the less synchronized colony in Magdalenefjorden and in
   consequence a negative effect on nestling body mass and survival. We
   found that in both colonies Calanus glacialis (copepodite stage CV) was
   the most important prey item in the chick diet making up 68-87 \% of the
   biomass and energy of all prey items. The only exception was the end of
   the chick-rearing period in Magdalenefjorden, when contribution of this
   prey item was significantly lower (24-26 \%). Thus, late breeders in
   Magdalenefjorden were apparently mismatched regarding C. glacialis CV
   availability. However, the hatching date did not affect birds fitness
   (reproductive output and chick pre-fledging mass) significantly. Results
   of our study indicate that little auks breeding on Spitsbergen can
   respond to a wide range of environmental conditions and prey
   availabilities through the plasticity of their foraging behaviour, which
   may help them to maintain their optimum fitness level in changing and

Abstract = {{In marine ecosystems, primary productivity and consequently food
   availability for higher trophic levels are often strongly affected by
   the water temperature. Thus, differences in sea surface temperatures
   (SST) may lead to differences in the diet composition of predators, but
   this link is still unknown in many species. By combining GPS tracking
   and dive analyses on chick-rearing southern rockhopper penguins
   (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) with stable isotope analyses and
   monitoring of chick growth rates and chick survival, we here attempted a
   comprehensive assessment of the effects of inter-annual environmental
   variability as indicated by SST and chlorophyll a (reflecting primary
   productivity) data. Inter-annual differences in environmental variables
   around our study colony on New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands,
   contradicted the general expectation, with higher chlorophyll a
   concentrations coinciding with higher spring SST in 2010/2011 compared
   to 2009/2010. Penguins foraged further away from the colony during guard
   and creche in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010, while performing deeper
   dives in 2009/2010. Stable isotope mixing models suggested a
   crustacean-dominated chick diet in 2009/2010, compared to a mixture of
   squid and fish in 2010/2011. These differences in foraging behaviour and
   diet, however, had no consequences for chick growth rates or chick
   survival and thus had no apparent effect on population trajectories.
   Potentially, environmental conditions in both years could still be seen
   as favourable compared to other years and breeding sites, enabling the
   parental birds to buffer the environmental differences by plastic

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Some anthropogenic noise is now considered pollution, with evidence
   building that noise from human activities such as transportation,
   construction and exploration can impact behaviour and physiology in a
   broad range of taxa. However, relatively little research has considered
   the effects of repeated or chronic noise; extended exposures may result
   in habituation or sensitisation, and thus changes in response. We
   conducted a field-based experiment at Moorea Island to investigate how
   repeated exposure to playback of motorboat noise affected a coral reef
   fish (Dascyllus trimaculatus). We found that juvenile D. trimaculatus
   increased hiding behaviour during motorboat noise after two days of
   repeated exposure, but no longer did so after one and two weeks of
   exposure. We also found that naive individuals responded to playback of
   motorboat noise with elevated ventilation rates, but that this response
   was diminished after one and two weeks of repeated exposure. We found no
   strong evidence that baseline blood cortisol levels, growth or body
   condition were affected by three weeks of repeated motorboat noise
   playback. Our study reveals the importance of considering how tolerance
   levels may change over time, rather than simply extrapolating from
   results of short-term studies, if we are to make decisions about
   regulation and mitigation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   know little about what factors impact plant behavior, especially

   approach to investigate light foraging in a plant species that exhibits
   rapid movement: Mimosa pudica. We explored how herbivore avoidance
   behavior in M. pudica (which closes its leaflets temporarily when
   disturbed) is affected by an individual's energy state and the quality
   of the current environment and also repeatedly tested the behavior of
   individuals from two seed sources to determine whether individuals
   exhibit a ``personality{''} (i.e., behavioral syndrome). We found that
   when individuals are in a low-energy state, they adopt a riskier
   light-foraging strategy, opening leaflets faster, and not closing
   leaflets as often in response to a disturbance. However, when plants are
   in a high-energy state, they exhibit a plastic light-foraging strategy
   dependent on environment quality. Although we found no evidence that
   individuals exhibit behavioral syndromes, we found that individuals from
   different seed sources consistently behave differently from each other.
   Our results suggest that plants are capable of making state-dependent
   decisions and that plant decision making is complex, depending on the

Volume = {{300}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, an increasing body of research has addressed the
   extent to which different individuals within a species or population
   specialize in their exploitation of different food resources, which is
   referred to as individual diet specialization (IDS). Traditionally,
   researchers use the terms specialist' and generalist', despite the
   inability of these labels to capture all of the complexity of IDS. In
   this paper, we compare the dietary specialism of great tit Parus major
   and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus at different temporal and spatial
   scales. We use these two species to illustrate the differences within
   and between species in individual levels of IDS. Both of these species
   show greater IDS in Mediterranean habitats, where resources are less
   plentiful and more variable than in Northern Europe. Additionally, we
   also emphasize that IDS within populations may change temporally. At the
   same time, there are differences between species, with great tits
   showing a higher capacity than blue tits to specialize at both the
   individual and the population level. Great tits can be considered
   generalists at the species level and specialists at the individual
   level, while blue tits can be considered generalists at both the species
   and the individual level. Our study demonstrates that there is a need
   for researchers to determine the relative importance of intrinsic
   factors (e.g. differences between species or individuals in their
   behavioral flexibility or cognitive capacity) and extrinsic factors
   (e.g. resource base) in shaping patterns of dietary specialization. We
   conclude that, within and among species, different individuals respond
   differently to similar environmental pressures, utilize different niches
   and develop different functions in the ecosystem depending on their type
   of IDS. Therefore, we propose that label generalists' should distinguish
   between facultative generalists, which can develop new specializations,
   and obligate generalists, which have a limited capacity to develop novel
   specializations.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Starvation is defined as a failure to consume food following an
   extrinsic limitation. By focusing on arthropods, I provide here a
   detailed review of how starvation affects foraging behaviour, predation
   avoidance, aggressive interactions and reproductive behaviour. Behaviour
   following starvation is shaped by the trade-off between the value of
   food, which increases with hunger level, and other vital needs, such as
   reproduction and avoiding ending up as prey. Foraging should take place
   as long as its marginal benefit outweighs the associated costs,
   including the avoidance of other important activities. Because
   starvation affects both the benefit and cost of foraging, it has various
   effects on behaviour. Most of the behaviours of hungry animals are
   selected to increase the likelihood of detecting food and better exploit
   it. The effect of starvation on foraging has usually revealed an
   increase in activity, albeit also occasionally a decrease, possibly due
   to a lowered metabolic rate or exhaustion. Predation avoidance becomes
   compromised when arthropods are hungry. Such hunger is also expressed in
   choosing riskier but prey-richer habitats and in not avoiding dangerous
   behaviours. Starvation elevates aggression and competition, as well as
   cannibalism. However, starved individuals are not necessarily more often
   victorious in such conflicts. Reproductive activities, such as male
   courting, female responsiveness and mating duration, decrease under
   starvation. An exception to this are females that gain material
   benefits, such as nuptial gifts, and which often increase their sexual
   activity in the face of starvation. I suggest that several behavioural
   responses to starvation follow a hump-shaped pattern, such as an
   increase followed by a decrease in foraging and aggression intensities
   with increasing hunger level. I highlight several research approaches,
   such as uncovering the link between starvation-induced changes in
   behaviour and fitness, and their underlying physiological mechanisms.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{69-74}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of sociality is often accompanied by nutritional conflicts
   and the evolution of mechanisms to resolve them. The foraging behaviour
   of eusocial animals such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is generally
   considered to be largely regulated by the colony nutritional state.
   Previous work based on the information primacy hypothesis has however
   found that honeybee foragers explore (sample resources) and exploit
   (consume resources) in accordance with their individual nutritional
   state. We therefore hypothesized that individual and colony nutritional
   states differ in their influence on individuals of different behavioural
   phenotypes such as dancers and followers, who are akin to producers and
   scroungers, respectively. This leads to the prediction that these two
   behavioural groups will differ with respect to their
   exploration-exploitation trade-off and in terms of how they prioritize
   individual and colony nutritional states. We tested our predictions by
   creating a mismatch between individual and colony nutritional states.
   Our results show that dancers and followers do not differ in their
   levels of exploration and exploitation, but dancers are more responsive
   to colony nutritional state than are followers with regard to managing
   their exploration-exploitation trade-off. We discuss these results in
   the context of how these two behavioural phenotypes may differ in their
   sensitivity to the different nutritional pathways regulating worker
   behaviour in a eusocial colony and the evolution of sociality in
   general. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{Ghrelin, a peptide hormone produced by the stomach, is the endogenous
   ligand for the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR). Ghrelin acts
   on the GHSR to increase food intake, appetitive behaviors, and
   adiposity. Recently, a rat model with a null mutation to the GHSR gene
   (FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi)) was generated and used in behavioral studies, but
   the basic metabolic phenotype of this strain as well as that of the
   background strain (Fawn Hooded Hypertensive, FHH) has not been
   characterized in detail. Here we compared male FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats
   with their wild-type littermates (FHH-WT) in a number of metabolic
   parameters. In the 24 h of recovery following an acute overnight fast,
   FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats consumed less food than FHH-WT animals, and
   relative to their body weights, adult FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats consumed
   fewer calories when placed on a high fat diet. Despite this,
   FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats did not show a difference in diet-induced obesity
   or weight gain. Fasted FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats exhibited increased
   Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the
   Arcuate Nucleus (ARC), indicative of altered central regulation of
   feeding and energy balance. FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats exhibited lower
   levels of home cage locomotor behavior over the entire light/dark cycle,
   and reduced levels of food anticipatory activity when placed on a
   restricted feeding schedule. Finally, FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats consumed
   less of a palatable dessert (cookie dough) given after the completion of
   the scheduled meal. Altogether, our data show that rats lacking a
   functional GHSR tend to eat less than their wild type counterparts in
   the face of acute fasts, chronic high-fat diet exposure, and exposure to
   a palatable dessert, despite not showing differences in body weight and
   glucose homeostasis that are characteristic of GHSR null mice. These
   data indicate that many, but not all responses to GHSR ablation are
   conserved between rats and mice. The FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rat thus
   represents a novel and useful model for studying GHSR function in rats.

Abstract = {{Laboratory selection in thermal regimes that differed in the amplitude
   and the predictability of daily fluctuations had a marked effect on
   stress resistance and life history traits in Drosophila simulans. The
   observed evolutionary changes are expected to be the result of both
   direct and correlated responses to selection. Thus, a given trait might
   not evolve independently from other traits because of genetic
   correlations among these traits. Moreover, different test environments
   can induce novel genetic correlations because of the activation of
   environmentally dependent genes. To test whether and how genetic
   correlations among stress resistance and life history traits constrain
   evolutionary adaptation, we used three populations of D. simulans
   selected for 20 generations in constant, predictable and unpredictable
   daily fluctuating thermal regimes and tested each of these selected
   populations in the same three thermal regimes. We explored the
   relationship between genetic correlations between traits and the
   evolutionary potential of D. simulans by comparing genetic correlation
   matrices in flies selected and tested in different thermal test regimes.
   We observed genetic correlations mainly between productivity, body size,
   starvation and desiccation tolerance, suggesting that adaptation to the
   three thermal regimes was affected by correlations between these traits.
   We also found that the correlations between some traits such as body
   size and productivity or starvation tolerance and productivity were
   determined by test regime rather than selection regime that is expected
   to limit genetic adaptation to thermal regimes in these traits. The
   results of this study suggest that several traits and several
   environments are needed to explore adaptive responses, as genetic and
   environmentally induced correlations between traits as results obtained
   in one environment cannot be used to predict the response of the same
   population in another environment.}},

Abstract = {{If genetic architectures of various quantitative traits are similar, as

   this prediction, we used a laboratory model of vertebrate adaptive
   radiation to investigate the genetic basis of the response to selection

   reported in an earlier work. After 13 generations of selection, the
   proportion of bank voles (Myodes {[}=Clethrionomys] glareolus) showing
   predatory behavior was five times higher in selected lines than in
   controls. We analyzed the hippocampus and liver transcriptomes and found
   repeatable changes in allele frequencies and gene expression. Genes with
   the largest differences between predatory and control lines are
   associated with hunger, aggression, biological rhythms, and functioning
   of the nervous system. Evolution of predatory behavior could be
   meaningfully compared with evolution of high aerobic capacity, because
   the experiments and analyses were performed in the same methodological
   framework. The number of genes that changed expression was much smaller
   in predatory lines, and allele frequencies changed repeatably in
   predatory but not in aerobic lines. This suggests thatmore variants of
   smaller effects underlie variation in aerobic performance, whereas fewer
   variants of larger effects underlie variation in predatory behavior. Our
   results thus contradict the view that comparable selection pressures for
   different quantitative traits produce similar molecular patterns.
   Therefore, to gain knowledge about molecular-level response to selection
   for complex traits, we need to investigate not only multiple replicate
   populations but also multiple quantitative traits.}},

Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{3-9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Infants are born equipped to ingest nutrients, but have to learn what to
   eat. This must occur early, because the mode of feeding evolves
   dramatically, from ``tube{''} feeding in utero to eating family foods.
   Eating habits established during early years contribute to the
   development of subsequent eating habits. Therefore, it is fundamental to
   understand the most important early periods (between birth and 2 years,
   i.e. onset of food neophobia) for the development of eating habits and
   the drivers of this development. The role of pleasure in eating is
   central, especially during childhood when cognitive drivers of food
   choices may be less prominent than later in life. It is not easy to
   define and measure pleasure of eating in early childhood. However, it is
   possible to identify the characteristics of the eating experience which
   contribute to drive infant's eating and to shape preferences (food
   sensory properties; food rewarding properties; social context of
   eating). The learning processes involve repeated exposure (including to
   a variety of flavours), association with post-absorptive consequences
   and with contextual signals (including family members). The important
   early periods for learning food pleasure start being well identified.
   Beyond the first flavour discoveries during the prenatal and lactation
   periods (through the infant's exposure to flavours from foods of the
   mother's diet), the most important phase may be the beginning of
   complementary feeding. Infants discover the sensory (texture, taste and
   flavour) and nutritional properties (energy density) of the foods that
   will ultimately compose their adult diet; parents are still in charge of
   providing appropriate foods, timing, context for eating.
   Inter-individual differences in food pleasure learning, related to
   temperamental dimensions, or to sensory sensitivity also have to be
   taken into account. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Food neophobia is a personality trait that can influence children's food

   purpose of this study was to determine whether Spanish children and

   quality and different body composition measures compared with their
   non-neophobic peers. A community sample of 831 participants (368 males
   and 463 females) aged between 8 and 16 years were classified into three
   groups based on scores obtained on the Spanish Child Food Neophobia
   Scale. The results showed that food neophobia was not related to either
   BMI or body fat percentage, although neophobic children did have
   slightly lower weight and skeletal muscle mass than their neophilic
   counterparts. The KidMed index showed that neophobic children and
   adolescents presented a poorer quality of Mediterranean diet, due to a
   lower intake of fruit, vegetables, and fish, a higher intake of sweets
   or candy, and by reason of having an unbalanced breakfast. Neophobia was
   more common among females than males, but its occurrence was similar
   across age groups. These findings support previous research suggesting
   that neophobia impacts on diet quality. However, no relationship between
   diet and BMI was found. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the amount of prey available is an important part of an
   animal's foraging behaviour. The risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts
   that an organism's foraging decisions with regard to food rewards
   depending upon its satiation level. However, the precise interaction
   between optimal risk-tolerance and satiation level remains unclear. In
   this study, we examined, firstly, whether cuttlefish, with one of the
   most highly evolved nervous system among the invertebrates, have number
   sense, and secondly, whether their valuation of food reward is satiation
   state dependent. When food such as live shrimps is present, without
   training, cuttlefish turn toward the prey and initiate seizure
   behaviour. Using this visual attack behaviour as a measure, cuttlefish
   showed a preference for a larger quantity when faced with
   two-alternative forced choice tasks (1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, 3 versus 4
   and 4 versus 5). However, cuttlefish preferred the small quantity when
   the choice was between one live and two dead shrimps. More importantly,
   when the choice was between one large live shrimp and two small live
   shrimps (a prey size and quantity trade-off), the cuttlefish chose the
   large single shrimp when they felt hunger, but chose the two smaller
   prey when they were satiated. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish
   are capable of number discrimination and that their choice of prey
   number depends on the quality of the prey and on their appetite state.
   The findings also suggest that cuttlefish integrate both internal and
   external information when making a foraging decision and that the cost
   of obtaining food is inversely correlated with their satiation level, a
   phenomenon similar to the observation that metabolic state alters
   economic decision making under risk among humans.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although it is known that maternal disordered eating is
   related to restrictive feeding practices, there is little research
   exploring mechanisms for this association or its effects on other
   feeding practices. The purpose of this study was to assess whether
   maternal emotion responses mediate the association between maternal
   binge eating (BE) and child feeding practices, in order to identify
   potential risk factors for feeding practices that influence child
   weight.
   Methods: This longitudinal observational study included (n = 260)
   mothers and children from the STRONG Kids Panel Survey. At Wave 1,
   children were an average of 37 months old (SD = 6.9), and at Wave 2
   children were an average of 57 months old (SD = 8.3). Mothers
   self-reported their frequency of binge eating behavior (Wave 1),
   responses to children's negative emotions (Wave 1), feeding practices
   (Wave 1 and Wave 2), and child height and weight were measured at both
   time points. Using bias-corrected bootstrapping procedures, we tested
   the hypothesis that longitudinal associations between maternal BE and
   nonresponsive parent feeding practices would be mediated by parents'
   unsupportive responses to children's negative emotion. We also tested a
   serial mediation model positing that maternal BE predicts child body
   mass index (BMI) percentile change 18-24 months later, indirectly
   through unsupportive responses to negative emotion and nonresponsive
   feeding practices.
   Results: Maternal BE predicted use of more nonresponsive feeding
   practices (e.g. Emotion Regulation, Restriction for Health, Pressure to
   Eat, and Food as Reward), indirectly through more Distress responses to
   children's negative emotions. In the serial mediation model, maternal BE
   was associated with greater use of Distress responses, which indirectly
   predicted higher child BMI percentile through Food as Reward feeding
   practices.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that maternal eating and emotion
   responsiveness are important for understanding the interpersonal context
   of feeding behaviors, and child weight outcomes. Distress responses may
   serve as a risk factor for use of unhealthful feeding practices among
   mothers with BE and these responses may increase children's risk for
   weight gain.}},

   analysis of covariance with Bonferroni post hoc tests. Analyses were
   controlled for age, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, food
   security status, educational attainment, and social desirability trait.
   Results
   The frequency of vegetable intake differed by race/ethnicity (cooked or
   canned beans were consumed more often among Hispanic than non-Hispanic
   black and non-Hispanic white or other participants, orange-colored
   vegetables were consumed more often among Hispanics than non-Hispanic
   black participants, and other vegetables were consumed more often among
   non-Hispanic white or other than among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic
   participants), origin (other vegetables were consumed more often among
   Columbian and other Hispanics than Dominican participants) and nativity
   (orange-colored vegetables were consumed more often among foreign-born
   than US-born Hispanics). Fruit and vegetable intake did not differ by
   language preference among foreign-born Hispanics.
   Conclusion
   Differences in fruit and vegetable consumption among WIC participants by
   race/ethnicity and by Hispanic origin and nativity may have implications
   for WIC nutrition policies and nutrition education efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The management and recovery of large predator populations in areas where
   human persecution has driven them to ecological extinction requires a
   solid understanding of the effects of both predation and food limitation
   on prey populations. We used 11 yr of data on reported losses among 17.3
   million free-ranging sheep Ovis aries in the Norwegian farming industry
   to elucidate the relative roles of climate, vegetation characteristics,
   sheep densities, lamb body mass and densities of predators and
   alternative prey on the number of lambs and ewes lost on summer
   pastures. We first examined whether predator densities predicted autumn
   lamb body mass through possible impacts of predators on body growth
   (non-lethal effects) but found no evidence for such effects in our study
   system. This might be due to weak anti-predator behavioral responses in
   domesticated sheep. However, autumn lamb body mass was predicted by both
   sheep density and winter and spring weather conditions, probably through
   food availability. Losses of both lambs and ewes were positively and
   strongly related to the density of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, wolverine
   Gulo gulo and brown bear Ursus arctos. In addition, food availability
   and spring weather conditions were associated to losses of lambs, while
   precipitation in May predicted losses of ewes. There was little evidence
   for interaction effects of predator species on losses, suggesting that
   most of the effects of the predators were additive to each other. Given
   the strong effect of predator densities on sheep losses, we conclude
   that changing livestock husbandry practices towards a system that
   actively protects sheep and/or active management of predator densities
   may be necessary to reduce sheep losses where predators are
   recolonizing.}},

Abstract = {{Food subsidies have become a widely available and predictable resource
   in human-modified landscapes for many vertebrate species. Such resources
   can alter individual foraging behavior of animals, and induce
   population-wide changes. Yet, little consensus exists about the relative
   influence of the availabilities of native and human food subsidies to
   wildlife foraging throughout altered landscapes. We explored this
   unresolved question by analyzing the effects of landscape factors on
   American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet across the state of
   Colorado, USA. We estimated assimilated diet using stable isotope
   analysis of harvested black bear tissues to determine the contribution
   of human-derived foods to bear diets throughout Colorado, as well as how
   increasing reliance on human-derived food subsidies increases the risk
   of conflict. We found that bears (n = 296) showed strong regional diet
   variability, but substantial use of human-derived food subsidies in
   eastern Colorado (>30\% assimilated diet). The age-sex class of the bear
   and housing density of its harvest location were the most influential
   predictors of C-13 enrichment (a tracer of human food subsidies).
   Furthermore, foraging on subsidies increased risk of conflict; the odds
   of being a nuisance bear increased by 60\% for each similar to 1 parts
   per thousand increase in delta C-13. Our study confirms the efficacy of
   delta C-13 as a proxy for human activity, and indicates that while
   demographic differences play a clear role in the foraging ecology of
   bears, availability of subsidies coincident with varying levels of human
   activity appears to be a major driver in predicting black bear diet
   throughout the western United States. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Theory-based predictions on asymmetries in animal contests have seldom
   been tested in situations where payoff asymmetries exist among
   contestants otherwise clearly matched for physical fighting capacity
   (i.e., resource holding potential, RHP). We examined the effects of food
   availability and predation risk on contest outcomes and the maintenance
   of dominance hierarchies in size-matched male noble crayfish pairs
   (Astacus astacus). Following theoretical predictions, dominant status
   established via contests staged in a non-resource context successfully
   predicted contest outcome (resource use) once resources were made
   available. Still, resource availability significantly increased the
   aggressive motivation of subordinates and sometimes resulted in
   hierarchy reversals. In subsequent resource-based contests, subordinates
   increased their fighting intensity, whereas dominants reduced their
   fighting motivation, potentially reflecting hunger-driven payoff
   asymmetries. Moreover, the data support the ``asset-protection{''}
   principle by showing for the first time that predation risk lowered the
   aggressive motivation of dominants. At the same time, the percentage of
   fighting bouts won by subordinates increased significantly, leading to
   reversal of prior dominance relationships in 30 \% of pairs. Compared to
   pairs where the hierarchy was retained through the different contests,
   pairs where dominance was reversed were characterized by smaller RHP
   asymmetries, which is again consistent with theory. These results show
   how animal contest behavior can be sensitive to the complex interactive
   effects of prior experience, resource value and RHP. Furthermore, in
   systems where repeated contests lead to dominance hierarchies, reversals
   within the hierarchy may occur more often when the RHP asymmetry between
   contestants is small.
   Contest outcome and resulting dominance status of contestants may be
   influenced by relative resource value and perceived costs involved in
   animal contests, especially when individuals are similar in major
   correlates of fighting ability, i.e., often body and weapon size.
   However, empirical evidence is scant. Using size-matched male crayfish
   pairs, we investigated the effects of food availability and predation
   threat on fighting behavior on individual and pair level and on
   hierarchy maintenance in repeated contests. Our study reveals novel
   evidence, indicating that crayfish are capable of changing their
   decisions during contests in response to food availability and predation
   threat, which can alter the hierarchy. For example, dominants reduced
   their aggressiveness in the presence of predation threat. Overall,
   hierarchy reversals were more likely in pairs where the difference in
   fighting ability between contestants was smaller.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of animals to find and consume hoarded seeds (i.e. seed
   recovery) is a key stage within the seed dispersal process. However, the
   ecology of seed recovery is still poorly understood. Here, we analyze
   the factors controlling seed recovery by scatter-hoarding rodents in an
   oak-dominated temperate forest. We examined the relative importance of
   intrinsic seed traits (i.e. plant-driven) and extrinsic seed factors
   (i.e. animal-driven) on the probability of seed recovery. We found that
   seed recovery is mainly driven by extrinsic seed factors, mostly related
   to animal behavior (pilfering frequency, microsite preference, predation
   risk, burial depth and cache size). Important intrinsic traits such as
   seed size, seed quality and seed-drop timing were, on average, of lower
   significance in the probability of seed recovery (2.8-times less
   important than extrinsic factors); only seed quality was an important
   intrinsic trait. On the other hand, larger and nutritionally more
   valuable seeds showed a removal-recovery tradeoff as they enhance seed
   removal and hoarding (increasing dispersal quality) but also favour seed
   recovery (increasing predation). We find that other mechanisms beyond
   seed traits (e.g. masting) are needed to decrease seed recovery and,
   thus, increase seed survival. We conclude that, as seed recovery is
   mostly driven by animal behavioural factors, it substantially differs
   from other previous stages of the seed dispersal process that are more
   dependent on seed traits. We argue that seed recovery needs further
   attention to advance our understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal
   and the role of secondary dispersers as a selective force for seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Longer breastfeeding duration appears to have a protective
   effect against childhood obesity. This effect may be partially mediated
   by maternal feeding practices during the first years of life. However,
   the few studies that have examined links between breastfeeding duration
   and subsequent feeding practices have yielded conflicting results.
   Objective: Using a large sample of first-time mothers and a newly
   validated, comprehensive measure of maternal feeding (the Feeding
   Practices and Structure Questionnaire), this study examined associations
   between breastfeeding duration and maternal feeding practices at child
   age 24 months.
   Methods: Mothers (n = 458) enrolled in the NOURISH trial provided data
   on breastfeeding at child age 4, 14, and 24 months, and on feeding
   practices at 24 months. Structural equation modeling was used to examine
   associations between breastfeeding duration and 5 nonresponsive and 4
   structure-related authoritative feeding practices, adjusting for a range
   of maternal and child characteristics.
   Results: The model showed acceptable fit ((2)/df = 1.68; root mean
   square error of approximation = .04, comparative fit index = .91, and
   Tucker-Lewis index = .89) and longer breastfeeding duration was
   negatively associated with 4 out of 5 nonresponsive feeding practices
   and positively associated with 3 out of 4 structure-related feeding
   practices. Overall, these results suggest that mothers who breastfeed
   longer reported using more appropriate feeding practices.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrate an association between longer
   breastfeeding duration and authoritative feeding practices characterized
   by responsiveness and structure, which may partly account for the
   apparent protective effect of breastfeeding on childhood obesity.}},

Abstract = {{By exploiting unutilized resources, organisms expand into novel niches,
   which can lead to adaptive radiation. However, some groups fail to
   diversify despite the apparent opportunity to do so. Although arising
   multiple times, arboreal folivores are rare and have not radiated,
   presumably because of energetic constraints. To explore this hypothesis,
   we quantified the field metabolic rate (FMR), movement, and body
   temperature for syntopic two-and three-toed sloths, extreme arboreal
   folivores that differ in their degree of specialization. Both species
   expended little energy, but three-toed sloths (162 kJ/day{*}kg(0.734))
   possessed the lowest FMR recorded for any mammal. Three-toed sloths were
   more heterothermic and moved less than two-toed sloths. We then compared
   FMRs and basal metabolic rates (BMRs) for 19 species of arboreal
   folivores along a spectrum of specialization. Overall, arboreal
   folivores had lower BMRs and FMRs than other mammals, and increasing
   specialization led to lower FMRs but not BMRs. Thus, reduced energetic
   expenditure in specialized species was the result of thermoregulatory
   and behavioral strategies, rather than simply a proportionate reduction
   in BMR. Altogether, our findings support the concept that arboreal
   folivores are tightly constrained by nutritional energetics and help to
   explain the lack of radiation among species exploiting a lifestyle in
   the trees.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Territorial males may adopt a mating tactic that yields greater
   reproductive success but that at the same time increases the risk of
   predation. Plasticity in reproductive behavior can reflect a balance
   between sexual selection and natural selection. In this study, we sought
   to verify the effect of predation risk on territorial behavior of males
   of the solitary bee Ptilothrix fructifera (Apidae). Males of the species
   employ alternative mating tactics and can be territorial in defense of
   larval food sources. By manipulating predator models in the field, we
   tested whether (1) males avoid perch flowers containing predator models;
   (2) males alternate between mating tactics when their territory is
   associated with a predation risk; and (3) female foraging on flowers in
   a territory is altered in the presence of a predator model. We measured
   the responses of males and females in flowers containing and not
   containing a model of a spider or a stuffed bird. The results show that
   territorial males of P. fructifera alter their territorial behavior when
   faced with a high risk of predation. They do not abandon their territory
   or change to a non-territorial mating tactic, but instead change the use
   of their territory, avoiding flowers containing predator models or
   perching on other flowers when the previous flower presented a potential
   predation risk. Female P. fructifera decreases the frequency of their
   visits to flowers and the length of time spent there in the presence of
   a spider model. In short, in the face of predation risk, females and
   males alter their behaviors at the cost of less efficient foraging and
   searching for partners, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The main objective of this study was to investigate the
   relationship between various factors (e.g., sociodemographic, child, and
   parental factors) and the healthfulness of parental responses to child
   in-store food purchasing requests. Additionally, a secondary objective
   is to describe ``resist strategies{''} used by parents to respond to
   child food-purchasing requests and their efficacy in avoiding conflict.
   Methods Parent-child dyads (children aged 2-6 years) completed an
   audio-/visual-recoded food shopping trip at their usual grocery store
   and time. Recordings of trips were coded for behavioral and
   environmental factors. Parental healthful response rate (i.e., percent
   of responses that were healthful) was the primary outcome variable. A
   healthful response occurred when a parent yielded to a healthful child
   request, or resisted a non-healthful request. Parents also completed a
   questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess the relationship
   between the main outcome variable and sociodemographic, child, and
   parent factors. Results Parents (n = 39) responded healthfully to 62.9
   \% (+/- 26.7 \%) of child food purchasing requests. Low- and
   middle-income parents, and black and white parents, had significantly
   higher healthful response rates compared to high-income parents (p =
   0.03) and Hispanic/Indian-descent parents (p = 0.02), respectively.
   Using the ``ignore{''} strategy proved an effective resist strategy in
   this study, leading to no parent-child conflicts. Conclusions
   Programming that seeks to improve the healthfulness of food purchasing
   in families with young children should address unhealthful response
   behaviors in Hispanic/Indian-descent parents and high-income parents;
   although, the needs of these groups are different. Further research is
   needed to confirm and expand on these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal feeding styles in infancy and early childhood are associated

   psychosocial factors that influence feeding styles during the
   complementary feeding period, the time during which infants transition

   non-milk products, have received less attention. The present study
   explores how maternal psychosocial factors specifically self-esteem,
   parenting self-efficacy, parenting satisfaction, and depression symptoms
   influence mothers' infant feeding styles at nine months of age, a time
   during which solid foods eating habits are being established.
   Participants included 160 low-income, African-American mother-infant
   pairs in central North Carolina who were enrolled in the Infant Care and
   Risk of Obesity Study. Regression models tested for associations between
   maternal psychosocial characteristics and pressuring and restrictive
   feeding styles. Models were first adjusted for maternal age, education,
   marital status and obesity status. To account for infant
   characteristics, models were then adjusted for infant weight-for-length,
   distress to limitations and activity level scores. Maternal self-esteem
   was negatively associated with pressuring to soothe. Maternal parenting
   self-efficacy was positively associated with restriction-diet quality.
   Maternal parenting satisfaction and depression symptoms were not
   associated with feeding styles in the final models. Focusing on
   strengthening maternal self-esteem and parenting self-efficacy may help
   to prevent the development of less desirable infant feeding styles. (C)

Volume = {{103}},

Abstract = {{Based on work a quarter century ago, it is widely accepted personality
   traits like sensation seeking are related to the enjoyment and intake of
   spicy foods; however, data supporting this belief is actually quite
   limited. Recently, we reported strong to moderate correlations between
   remembered spicy food liking and two personality traits measured with
   validated questionnaires. Here, participants consumed
   capsaicin-containing strawberry jelly to generate acute estimates of
   spicy food liking. Additionally, we used a laboratory-based behavioral
   measure of risk taking (the mobile Balloon Analogue Risk Task; mBART) to
   complement a range of validated self-report measures of risk-related
   personality traits. Present data confirm Sensation Seeking correlates
   with overall spicy meal liking and liking of the burn of a spicy meal,
   and extends prior findings by showing novel correlations with the liking
   of sampled stimuli. Other personality measures, including Sensitivity to
   Punishment (SP), Sensitivity to Reward (SR), and the Impulsivity and
   Risk Taking subscales of the DSM5 Personality Inventory (PID-5) did not
   show significant relationships with liking of spicy foods, either
   sampled or remembered. Our behavioral risk taking measure, the mBART,
   also failed to show a relationship with remembered or sampled liking.
   However, significant relationships were observed between reported intake
   of spicy foods and Sensitivity to Reward, and the Risk Taking subscale
   of the PID-5 (PID5-RT). Based on the observed patterns among various
   personality measures, and spicy food liking and intake, we propose that
   personality measures may exert their influence on intake of spicy food
   via different mechanisms. We also speculate that Sensation Seeking may
   reflect motivations for consuming spicy foods that are more intrinsic,
   while the motivations for eating spicy foods measured by SR and PID5-RT
   may be more extrinsic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic mechanisms are believed to link environmental exposures to
   gene expression, and in so doing, to provide a physical basis for the
   activation, by life experiences, of mental-health problems. This paper
   provides a background to the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms link
   life stresses (perinatal, childhood and adult) and effects of
   malnutrition to the eating disorders (EDs). The paper reviews literature
   bearing upon the putative link between epigenetic factors and ED
   development, and examines ways in which epigenetic alterations could
   account for risk of eating disturbances and commonly associated
   behavioral and emotional problems. Ultimately, we propose that
   epigenetic processes provide an intriguing (although hypothetical)
   biological ``platform{''} upon which ED-relevant effects of perinatal
   insults, life stresses, and consequences of malnutrition may be
   registered, and argue that an epigenetically informed understanding may
   explain why EDs are triggered and maintained by excessive caloric
   restraint, why they coincide so frequently with mood- and impulse
   regulation problems, and why they tend to become increasingly entrenched
   over time. Finally, we comment on the clinical relevance and
   implications of an epigenetically informed model of ED etiology. (C)

Abstract = {{Parasites are ubiquitous in wildlife populations, but physiological and
   behavioural responses of hosts to infection are difficult to measure. We
   experimentally treated semi-free-ranging red-capped mangabeys
   (Cercocebus torquatus) in Nigeria with antiparasitic drugs and examined
   subsequent changes in glucocorticoid production and individual
   behaviour. Because both parasites and stress impact energy balance and
   health, we measured (i) behavioural time re-allocation via activity
   budgets, (ii) social relationships (e.g. social connectivity and
   dominance hierarchy stability) and (iii) body condition. We collected
   triplicate faecal samples (n = 441) from 49 individuals prior to and
   following treatment. Cortisol levels fluctuated in parallel with
   parasite abundance. Elevations in cortisol, but not parasitism, were
   related to reduced body condition. Behaviour also shifted according to
   infection status, with uninfected individuals spending more time
   foraging and less time resting and vigilant compared with when they were
   infected. Time spent feeding, travelling or socializing did not differ
   between pre- and post-treatment time periods. Group cohesion, but not
   dominance stability, changed following treatment, suggesting
   parasite-induced social avoidance. Together, these findings show a
   coordinated response to infection that promotes host tolerance through
   stress and energy conservation, reduces transmission risk and increases
   protection when infected hosts are vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{The migration strategy of many capital breeders is to garner body stores
   along the flyway at distinct stopover sites. The rate at which they can
   fuel is likely to be strongly influenced by a range of factors, such as
   physiology, food availability, time available for foraging and perceived
   predation. We analysed the foraging behaviour and fuel accumulation of
   pink-footed geese, an Arctic capital breeder, at their mid-flyway spring
   stopover site and evaluated to what extent their behaviour and fuelling
   were related to physiological and external factors and how it differed
   from other stopovers along the flyway. We found that fuel accumulation
   rates of geese at the mid-flyway site were limited by habitat
   availability rather than by digestive constraints. However, as the time
   available for foraging increased over the stopover season, geese were
   able to keep constant fuelling rate. Putting this in perspective, geese
   increased their daily net energy intake along the flyway corresponding
   to the increase in time available for foraging. The net energy intake
   per hour of foraging remained the same. Geese showed differences in
   their reaction to predators/disturbance between the sites, taking higher
   risks particularly at the final stopover site. Hence, perceived
   predation along the flyway may force birds to postpone the final fuel
   accumulation to the last stopover along the flyway. Flexibility in
   behaviour appears to be an important trait to ensure fitness in this
   capital breeder. Our findings are based on a new, improved method for
   estimating fuel accumulation of animals foraging in heterogeneous
   landscapes based on data obtained from satellite telemetry and habitat
   specific intake rates.}},

   Individual, Freely-moving Bumble Bees (Bombus terrestris)}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{113}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Generalist pollinators like the buff-tailed bumble bee, Bombus
   terrestris, encounter both nutrients and toxins in the floral nectar
   they collect from flowering plants. Only a few studies have described
   the gustatory responses of bees toward toxins in food, and these
   experiments have mainly used the proboscis extension response on
   restrained honey bees. Here, a new behavioral assay is presented for
   measuring the feeding responses of freely-moving, individual worker
   bumble bees to nutrients and toxins. This assay measures the amount of
   solution ingested by each bumble bee and identifies how tastants in food
   influence the microstructure of the feeding behavior.
   The solutions are presented in a microcapillary tube to individual
   bumble bees that have been previously starved for 2-4 hr. The behavior
   is captured on digital video. The fine structure of the feeding behavior
   is analyzed by continuously scoring the position of the proboscis
   (mouthparts) from video recordings using event logging software. The
   position of the proboscis is defined by three different behavioral
   categories: (1) proboscis is extended and in contact with the solution,
   (2) proboscis is extended but not in contact with the solution and (3)
   proboscis is stowed under the head. Furthermore the speed of the
   proboscis retracting away from the solution is also estimated.
   In the present assay the volume of solution consumed, the number of
   feeding bouts, the duration of the feeding bouts and the speed of the
   proboscis retraction after the first contact is used to evaluate the
   phagostimulatory or the deterrent activity of the compounds tested.
   This new taste assay will allow researchers to measure how compounds
   found in nectar influence the feeding behavior of bees and will also be
   useful to pollination biologists, toxicologists and neuroethologists
   studying the bumble bee's taste system.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing evidence that members of animal groups synchronize
   their vigilance behavior to minimize predation risk. Because
   synchronized vigilance deviates from the classical vigilance models,
   which assume independent scanning, it is important to understand when
   and why it occurs. We explored vigilance behavior of wild boar (Sus
   scrofa) in a population subject to spatial variation in human hunting
   risk and seasonal variation in food availability. Group members
   synchronized their vigilance behavior. We hypothesized that vigilance
   synchronization would be context dependent and the trade-off between
   energy gain and safety would shape the relationship between the degree
   of vigilance synchronization and group size. We predicted weaker
   synchronization in large groups under heavy predation risk, due to
   benefits of numerical dilution, and stronger synchronization in large
   groups when food is limiting, due to intense food competition. The
   degree of synchronization decreased with increasing group size in the
   area where human hunting added another risk factor to the natural
   predation, pointing at the safety benefits of vigilance synchrony for
   members of small groups and the role of human-induced risk in shaping
   vigilance synchrony. We found no relation between vigilance synchrony
   and group size in a food scarce, winter season. However, low levels of
   vigilance and its synchronization observed in winter indicated that
   energy gain was prioritized over safety. Thus, members of wild boar
   groups can adjust levels of vigilance and its synchronization depending
   on the forage-risk trade-off set by the ecological context.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypically plastic changes in response to variation in perceived

   individuals reared together) on three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus
   aculeatus) morphology in a factorial common garden experiment. We found
   that exposure to chemical cues from potential predators did not

   defences (i.e. lateral plate numbers and dorsal spine lengths). However,
   sticklebacks exposed to predator cues developed longer caudal peduncles
   and larger eyes as compared with fish from the control treatment. As
   these responses may improve sticklebacks' ability to avoid piscine
   predation, they might be adaptive. Social environment/density also
   influenced expression of some traits, but these effects were independent
   of predation-risk treatment effects. In general, these results suggest

   leaf monkeys}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{145-153}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In group-living mammals, social dominance can be achieved and maintained
   via kin support, winner-loser effects and individual differences in
   resource-holding potential (RHP). When dominance is based on RHP, the
   likelihood of winning is also influenced by the incentive to compete.
   For females, this equation can be quite complex, as both age and
   reproductive state can alter the relative value of resources and the
   risks associated with fighting. For example, females that are young,
   pregnant or lactating may have high nutritional demands, while lactating
   females also face risks associated with offspring survival. To date,
   however, there have been few studies investigating how such factors
   influence female agonistic relationships. Here, we use 2 years of data
   to evaluate how age and reproductive state influence the probability of
   winning, focusing on two groups (5-9 and 10-12 females) of wild Phayre's
   leaf monkeys, Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus, at Phu Khieo Wildlife
   Sanctuary, Thailand. Consistent with previous studies, we found that
   young females and pregnant females were more likely to win dyadic
   interactions in the smaller group, PA. By contrast, the likelihood of
   winning was unrelated to age in the larger group, PB. Moreover,
   differences between reproductive states were less pronounced in PB, with
   females that were pregnant or in early lactation being more likely to
   win compared to females that were cycling. The deviating results for PB
   were likely associated with a greater number of competitors and small
   age differences intensifying intrasexual competition. These results
   highlight the importance of individual as well as demographic factors in
   female dominance relationships. In this population, females with high
   nutritional demands are more likely to win agonistic encounters,
   suggesting that female-female competition occurs primarily over access
   to resources. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{187-195}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{While most current predictive models agree that the climate is changing,
   it is not yet clear what impact these changes will have on animal
   populations. It is vital to determine the potential consequences in
   order to develop future management and conservation strategies. Climate
   change may impact population stability by prompting changes in breeding
   behaviour. For example, if above-average temperatures negatively affect
   adult body condition, this will increase the cost of parental care.
   Theory suggests that under this scenario, individuals may trade off
   their own body condition and survival against that of their young.
   Despite convincing evidence that this parental care trade-off exists in
   nature, the potential impact of climate change on parental investment
   strategies has rarely been investigated. In cooperatively breeding
   species, group-living adults can gain group size benefits, such as
   assistance with raising young. These benefits may mediate the effects of
   climate change on adult condition and subsequent investment in young.
   Here, we investigated the extent to which high temperatures and rainfall
   variation affect (1) adult provisioning rates to dependent nestlings,
   (2) offspring development and (3) the cost of offspring care in the
   cooperatively breeding pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor. We found that
   overall, adults provisioned young significantly less on hot days.
   However, this pattern was affected by rank: dominant individuals
   provisioned significantly less while subordinates did not. Offspring
   development was negatively affected by heatwave events, suggesting that
   young suffer from reduced investment on hot days. However, there was no
   evidence that the cost of provisioning young increased during heatwave
   periods, perhaps owing to the reduction in investment by adults. This
   study provides some of the first evidence that higher temperatures
   affect investment decisions in cooperative breeders and that dominant
   and subordinate individuals respond differently to this stressor. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding habitat use by animals requires understanding the
   simultaneous tradeoffs between food and predation risk within a
   landscape. Quantifying the synergy between patches that provide quality
   food and those that are safe from predators at a scale relevant to a
   foraging animal could better reveal the parameters that influence
   habitat selection. To understand more thoroughly how animals select
   habitat components, we investigated tradeoffs between diet quality and
   predation risk in a species endemic to sagebrush Artemisia spp.
   communities in North America, the pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis.
   This species is a rare example of a specialist herbivore that relies
   almost entirely on sagebrush for food and cover. We hypothesized that
   pygmy rabbits would forage in areas with low food risk (free of plant
   secondary metabolites, PSMs) and low predation risk (high concealment).
   However, because of relatively high tolerance to PSMs in sagebrush by
   pygmy rabbits, we hypothesized that they would trade off the risk of
   PSM-containing food to select lower predation risk when risks
   co-occurred. We compared food intake of pygmy rabbits during three
   double-choice trials designed to examine tradeoffs by offering animals
   two levels of food risk (1,8-cineole, a PSM) and predation risk
   (concealment cover). Rabbits ate more food at feeding stations with
   PSM-free food and high concealment cover. However, interactions between
   PSMs and cover suggested that the value of PSM-free food could be
   reduced if concealment is low and the value of high concealment can
   decrease if food contains PSMs. Furthermore, foraging decisions by
   individual rabbits suggested variation in tolerance of food or predation
   risks.}},

Abstract = {{Biological variability is no longer considered as statistical noise, but
   rather as an adaptive benefit. This variability comes from consistent
   differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals
   to a changing/challenging environment, named ``coping style{''},
   ``temperament{''} or ``personality{''}. Many studies have described how
   to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency
   over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about
   the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because
   contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to
   the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in
   personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely
   to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as
   important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was
   to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability)
   impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis,
   one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared
   juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for
   feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days.
   Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable
   versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass
   reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer
   than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they
   took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 +/-
   34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 +/- 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was
   similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing
   a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before
   and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance
   of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness.
   In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time
   should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as
   growth and behavior. Although personality traits are partially
   heritable, this study demonstrates the important influence of
   environmental conditions and life history on behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Driven by existential needs for thermal comfort, nutrition, and health,

   conditions. Entrepreneurs starting new businesses in more threatening or

   The regression results show that new business creation is experienced as
   being the hardest in the threatening environments of poorer countries
   with colder winters and cooler summers (e.g. Bolivia and Ukraine), and
   as being the easiest in the challenging environments of richer countries

Abstract = {{The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are
   well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been
   considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager
   population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal
   variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of
   initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality
   and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity.
   Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly.
   Residual lifespan increased by 57 \% when colonies were penned for 20
   days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory.
   Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into
   the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation
   did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population
   size declined when mortality exceeded 4 \% per day. Experimental
   increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to
   foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These
   results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers
   that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the
   well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained
   not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing
   at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker
   depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks,
   opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by
   inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger
   workers.}},

Title = {{The contribution of developmental experience vs. condition to life

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{915-926}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Developmental experience, for example food abundance during juvenile
   stages, is known to affect life history and behaviour. However, the life
   history and behavioural consequences of developmental experience have
   rarely been studied in concert. As a result, it is still unclear whether
   developmental experience affects behaviour through changes in life
   history, or independently of it. 2. The effect of developmental
   experience on life history and behaviour may also be masked or affected
   by individual condition during adulthood. Thus, it is critical to tease
   apart the effects of developmental experience and current individual
   condition on life history and behaviour. 3. In this study, we
   manipulated food abundance during development in the western black widow
   spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing spiders on either a restricted
   or ad lib diet. We separated developmental from condition-dependent
   effects by assaying adult foraging behaviour (tendency to attack prey
   and to stay on out of the refuge following an attack) and web structure
   multiple times under different levels of satiation following different
   developmental treatments. 4. Spiders reared under food restriction
   matured slower and at a smaller size than spiders reared in ad lib
   conditions. Spiders reared on a restricted diet were more aggressive
   towards prey and built webs structured for prey capture, while spiders
   reared on an ad lib diet were less aggressive and built safer webs.
   Developmental treatment affected which traits were plastic as adults:
   restricted spiders built safer webs when their adult condition
   increased, while ad lib spiders reduced their aggression when their
   adult condition increased. The amount of individual variation in
   behaviour and web structure varied with developmental treatment. Spiders
   reared on a restricted diet exhibited consistent variation in all
   aspects of foraging behaviour and web structure, while spiders reared on
   an ad lib diet exhibited consistent individual variation in aggression
   and web weight only. 5. Developmental experience affected the average
   life history, behaviour and web structure of spiders, but also shaped
   the amount of phenotypic variation observed among individuals.
   Surprisingly, developmental experience also determined the particular
   way in which individuals plastically adjusted their behaviour and web
   structure to changes in adult condition.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining the remarkable variation in socially monogamous females'
   extrapair (EP) behaviour revealed by decades of molecular paternity
   testing remains an important challenge. One hypothesis proposes that
   restrictive environmental conditions (e.g. extreme weather, food
   scarcity) limit females' resources and increase EP behaviour costs,
   forcing females to reduce EP reproductive behaviours. For the first
   time, we tested this hypothesis by directly quantifying within-pair and
   EP behaviours rather than inferring behaviour from paternity. We
   evaluated whether warmer sea surface temperatures depress total
   pre-laying reproductive behaviours, and particularly EP behaviours, in
   socially paired female blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii). Warm waters
   in the Eastern Pacific are associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation
   and lead to decreased food availability and reproductive success in this
   and other marine predators. With warmer waters, females decreased their
   neighbourhood attendance, total copulation frequency and laying
   probability, suggesting that they contend with restricted resources by
   prioritizing self-maintenance and committing less to reproduction,
   sometimes abandoning the attempt altogether. Females were also less
   likely to participate in EP courtship and copulations, but when they
   did, rates of these behaviours were unaffected by water temperature.
   Females' neighbourhood attendance, total copulation frequency and EP
   courtship probability responded to temperature differences at the
   between-season scale, and neighbourhood attendance and EP copulation
   probability were affected by within-season fluctuations. Path analysis
   indicated that decreased EP participation was not attributable to
   reduced female time available for EP activities. Together, our results
   suggest that immediate time and energy constraints were not the main
   factors limiting females' infidelity. Our study shows that El Nino
   conditions depress female boobies' EP participation and total
   reproductive activity. In addition to increasing general
   self-maintenance and reproductive costs, warm waters may increase costs
   specific to EP behaviours including divorce, reduced male parental care,
   or pathogen exposure. Our results suggest that female boobies
   strategically refrained from EP behaviours to avoid these or other
   longer-term costs, rather than being compelled by immediate constraints.
   This study demonstrates that current environmental conditions affect
   females' mating decisions, contributing to variation in EP behaviours,
   even in a long-lived, iteroparous species that can buffer against
   temporary adversity.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated diet and feeding behavior of the acrobatic cavy Kerodon
   acrobata, a rare caviomorph rodent endemic from the Cerrado (Brazilian
   savannah). We tested whether its trophic niche breadth varies between
   seasons and whether this species shows seasonal differences in food
   resource use. Feeding behavior was observed through observations of
   foraging activities in dry forest associated with limestone outcroppings
   in central Brazil. K. acrobata showed a generalist diet, feeding on
   leaves from at least 16 native plant families, also consuming flowers
   and fruits collected directly from plants or litterfall as well as
   branches, sprouts, and bark. The diversity of feeding behavior
   categories did not differ significantly between rainy and dry seasons.
   The trophic niche breadth considering the plant species consumed,
   however, decreased during the dry season, when this rodent relied mainly
   on fallen flowers of Handroanthus serratifolius (Caricaceae; about 44 \%
   of the identified feeding records). The diet of the acrobatic cavy was
   influenced by the availability of falling leaves and flowers during the
   dry season, when the animals focused their foraging activities on
   litterfall. The animals seemed not to extend their behavioral repertoire
   of foraging in the dry season; instead, they seasonally changed their
   resource exploitation strategy by altering the proportions of items used
   and the plant species consumed. The trophic niche breadth and plastic
   feeding behavior of the acrobatic cavies may explain their persistence
   in disturbed habitats. Their close relationship with the forests studied
   indicates the vulnerability of K. acrobata to activities that may
   threaten the integrity of dry forest areas.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged consumption of ketogenic diets (KD) has reported
   neuroprotective benefits. Several studies suggest MD interventions could
   be useful in the management of neurological and developmental disorders.
   Alterations in the Engrailed (En) genes, specifically Engrailed 2 (En2),
   have neurodevelopmental consequences and produce autism-related
   behaviors. The following studies used En2 knockout (MO; En2(-/-)), and
   wild-type (WT; En2(+/+)), male mice fed either KD (80\% fat, 0.1\%
   carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10\% fat, 70\% carbohydrates). The
   objective was to determine whether a MD fed from weaning at postnatal
   day (PND) 21 to adulthood (PND 60) would alter brain monoamines
   concentrations, previously found dysregulated, and improve social
   outcomes. In WT animals, there was an increase in hypothalamic
   norepinephrine content in the KD-fed group. However, regional monoamines
   were not altered in KO mice in MD-fed compared with CD-fed group. In
   order to determine the effects of juvenile exposure to KD in mice with
   normal blood ketone levels, separate experiments were conducted in mice
   removed from the KD or CD and fed standard chow for 2 days (PND 62). In
   a three-chamber social test with a novel mouse, MO mice previously
   exposed to the KD displayed similar social and self-grooming behaviors
   compared with the WT group. Groups previously exposed to a KD,
   regardless of genotype, had more c-Fos-positive cells in the cingulate
   cortex, lateral septal nuclei, and anterior bed nucleus of the stria
   terminalis. In the novel object condition, MO mice previously exposed to
   MD had similar behavioral responses and pattern of c-Fos
   immunoreactivity compared with the WT group. Thus, juvenile exposure to
   MD resulted in short-term consequences of improving social interactions
   and appropriate exploratory behaviors in a mouse model that displays
   autism-related behaviors. Such findings further our understanding of
   metabolic-based therapies for neurological and developmental disorders.

Abstract = {{The study aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of the German

   population sample (N = 2,507; age mean = 48.79, SD = 18.11; range 14 to
   94 years; 55.5\% women) using the SHI. All participants answered the
   German SHI, the short form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-15),
   the ultra-brief Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety
   (PHQ-4), and provided sociodemographic information. The one-factorial
   structure of the SHI was replicated using a confirmatory factor
   analysis. Internal consistency coefficients were sufficient and in line
   with previous studies. Almost half of the sample (49\%) acknowledged at
   least one self-harming behavior over the life-span, most frequently
   indirect forms of self-harm. The rate of participants who engaged in at
   least one SHI behavior was higher among men than women (51.6\% vs.
   46.9\%, respectively, chi(2) = 5.38, p = 0.020). Higher SHI scores were
   related to younger age, male gender, living alone, more symptoms of
   anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), higher impulsivity scores (BIS-15), and
   suffering from obesity grade 2. Women engaged more often in discreet
   forms of self-harm than men, e.g., preventing wounds from healing,
   exercising an injury, starving, and abusing laxatives. In terms of other
   indirect self-harming behaviors, men admitted more often driving
   recklessly, being promiscuous and losing a job on purpose, while women
   reported more frequently engaging in emotionally abusive relationships.
   With respect to direct self-harm, women were more likely to endorse
   suicide attempts and cutting, while men admitted more often
   head-banging. The findings suggest that self-harm constitutes a common

Abstract = {{Selection may favour individuals of the same population to differ
   consistently in nutritional preference, for example, because optimal
   diets covary with morphology or personality. We provided Southern field
   crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) with two synthetic food sources

   whether individuals were repeatable in carbohydrate and protein intake

   was correlated with its average daily intake of protein, and (iii)
   whether short-term changes in intake of carbohydrates coincided with
   changes in intake of protein within individuals. Intake rates were
   individually repeatable for both macronutrients. However, individuals
   differed in their relative daily intake of carbohydrates versus proteins

Title = {{Towards evenly distributed grazing patterns: including social context in
   sheep management strategies}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background. A large proportion of natural grasslands around the world is
   exposed to overgrazing resulting in land degradation and biodiversity
   loss. Although there is an increasing effort in the promotion of
   sustainable livestock management, rangeland degradation still occurs
   because animals' foraging behaviour is highly selective at different
   spatial scales. The assessment of the ecological mechanisms modulating
   the spatial distribution of grazing and how to control it has critical
   implications for long term conservation of resources and the
   sustainability of livestock production. Considering the relevance of
   social interactions on animals' space use patterns, our aim was to
   explore the potential effects of including animals' social context into
   management strategies using domestic sheep grazing in rangelands as case
   study.
   Methods. We used GPS data from 19 Merino sheep (approximately 10\% of
   the flock) grazing on three different paddocks (with sizes from 80 to
   1000 Ha) during a year, to estimate resource selection functions of
   sheep grazing in flocks of different levels of heterogeneity. We
   assessed the effects of sheep class (i.e., ewes, wethers, and hoggets),
   age, body condition and time since release on habitat selection
   patterns.
   Results. We found that social rank was reflected on sheep habitat use,
   where dominant individuals (i.e., reproductive females) used more
   intensively the most preferred areas and low-ranked (i.e., yearlings)
   used less preferred areas. Our results showed that when sheep grazed on
   more heterogeneous flocks, grazing patterns were more evenly distributed
   at all the paddocks considered in this study. On the other hand, when
   high-ranked individuals were removed from the flock, low-ranked sheep
   shifted their selection patterns by increasing the use of the most
   preferred areas and strongly avoided to use less preferred sites (i.e.,
   a highly selective grazing behaviour).
   Discussion. Although homogenization and segregation of flocks by classes
   are common practices to increase flock productivity, we are proposing an
   alternative that employs behavioural interactions in heterogeneous
   flocks to generate more evenly distributed grazing patterns. This
   practice can be combined with other practices such as rotational grazing
   and guardian dogs (to decrease mortality levels that may be generated by
   sheep grazing on more risky habitats). This does not imply any
   modifications of livestock stocking rates and densities or any
   additional investments for labour and materials. Considering livestock
   behaviour is critical for the design of sustainable management practices
   that balance landscape conservation and livestock productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Both men and women are vulnerable to weight gain during the
   college years, and this phenomenon is linked to an increased risk of
   several chronic diseases and mortality. Technology represents an
   attractive medium for the delivery of weight control interventions
   focused on college students, given its reach and appeal among this
   population. However, few technology-mediated weight gain prevention
   interventions have been evaluated for college students.
   Objective: This study examined a new technology-based, social
   media-facilitated weight gain prevention intervention for college
   students.
   Methods: Undergraduates (n = 58) in two sections of a public university
   course were allocated to either a behavioral weight gain prevention
   intervention (Healthy Weight, HW; N = 29) or a human papillomavirus
   (HPV) vaccination awareness intervention (control; N = 29). All students
   were enrolled, regardless of initial body weight or expressed interest
   in weight management. The interventions delivered 8 lessons via
   electronic newsletters and Facebook postings over 9 weeks, which were
   designed to foster social support and introduce relevant educational
   content. The HW intervention targeted behavioral strategies to prevent
   weight gain and provided participants with a Wi-Fi-enabled scale and an
   electronic physical activity tracker to facilitate weight regulation. A
   repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine
   within-and between-group differences in measures of self-reported weight
   control practices and objectively measured weight. Use of each
   intervention medium and device was objectively tracked, and intervention
   satisfaction measures were obtained.
   Results: Students remained weight stable (HW: -0.48+1.9 kg; control:
   -0.45+1.4 kg), with no significant difference between groups over 9
   weeks (P =. 94). However, HW students reported a significantly greater
   increase in the number of appropriate weight control strategies than did
   controls (2.1+4.5 vs -1.1+3.4, respectively; P =. 003) and there was no
   increase in inappropriate weight control behaviors (P =. 11). More than
   90\% of students in the HW arm opened the electronic newsletters each
   week, and the average number of Facebook interactions (comments and
   likes) per student each week was 3.3+1.4. Each self-monitoring device
   was initialized by 90\% of HW students. On average, they used their
   physical activity tracker for 23.7+15.2 days and their Wi-Fi scale for
   14.1+13.1 days over the 9 weeks. HW students rated the intervention
   favorably.
   Conclusions: The short-term effect of this technology-based weight gain
   prevention intervention for college students is promising and merits
   evaluation over a longer duration to determine whether engagement and
   behavioral improvements positively affect weight outcomes and can be
   maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological studies of species with wide distribution range and high
   commercial value, such as the banded murex Hexaplex trunculus (Linnaeus,
   1758), provide information on stock structure, which is the basis for
   understanding fish population dynamics and enable resource assessment
   for fisheries management. In the present study, we examined
   morphological variation among Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of
   H. trunculus using multivariate analysis. Our results supported the
   existence of four distinguishable stocks (Atlantic, Alboran, Western
   Mediterranean and Eastern Mediterranean), correctly classified 71.7\% of
   specimens, and indicated significant degrees of variation in
   morphometric characteristics between regions. Examination of the
   contribution of each morphometric variable to the principal components
   and canonical functions indicated that differences among samples seemed
   to be associated with the shell and aperture length and width. Samples
   from the Atlantic Ocean and the Alboran Sea had the largest shell size
   and the greatest morphometric divergence. This strong morphometric
   differentiation appears to be associated with local environmental
   factors (exposure on the rocky shores, food availability and predation)
   and oceanographic current barriers.}},

Abstract = {{Threat-sensitive behavioral trade-offs allow prey animals to balance the
   conflicting demands of successful predator detection and avoidance and a
   suite of fitness-related activities such as foraging, mating, and
   territorial defense.Here, we test the hypothesis that background
   predation level and reproductive status interact to determine the form
   and intensity of threat-sensitive behavioral decisions of wild-caught
   female Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata. Gravid and nongravid
   guppies collected from high-and low-predation pressure populations were
   exposed to serial dilutions of conspecific chemical alarm cues. Our
   results demonstrate that there was `no effect of reproductive status on
   the response of females originating from a low-predation population,
   with both gravid and nongravid guppies exhibiting strong anti-predator
   responses to the lowest concentration of alarm cues tested. Increasing
   cue concentrations did not result in increases in response intensity.
   Conversely, we found a significant effect of reproductive status among
   guppies from a high-predation population. Nongravid females from the
   high-predation population exhibited a strong graded (proportional)
   response to increasing concentrations of alarm cue. Gravid females from
   the same high-predation population, however, shifted to a nongraded
   response. Together, these results demonstrate that accrued reproductive
   assets influence the threat-sensitive behavioral decisions of prey, but
   only under conditions of high-ambient predation risk.}},

Title = {{Nectar chemistry modulates the impact of an invasive plant on native
   pollinators}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Invasive species are considered a main driver of pollinator declines,
   yet the direct effects of invasive alien plants on pollinators are
   poorly understood.
   2. Abundant, invasive plant species can provide a copious nectar
   resource for native pollinators. However, the nectar of some plants
   contains secondary compounds, usually associated with defence against
   herbivores. The impacts of these compounds on pollinators are often
   unknown.
   3. We compared how consumption of grayanotoxin I and III, natural
   secondary compounds in the nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum L.,
   affected three native bee species: a honeybee, (Apis mellifera L.), a
   solitary mining bee (Andrena carantonica, Perez) and a bumblebee,
   (Bombus terrestris, L.).
   4. Survival of the solitary bee and the bumblebee species was not
   affected by either grayanotoxin, but honeybees were similar to 20x more
   likely to die when fed solutions containing grayanotoxin I. Furthermore,
   solitary bees were deterred from feeding and exhibited malaise
   behaviours indicative of sublethal toxicity in response to consumption
   of grayanotoxin I. In contrast, grayanotoxins did not affect bumblebee
   survival or behaviour, even when bees were subjected to multiple
   stressors (parasite infection or food stress).
   5. Our experiments suggest that while R. ponticum provides abundant
   floral nectar, it is only available as a food resource to pollinators
   that tolerate grayanotoxins. Pollinators whose health is negatively
   affected by grayanotoxins may experience negative impacts from R.
   ponticum invasion directly (if they consume R. ponticum nectar) or
   indirectly (if native floral resources are replaced by R. ponticum).
   6. Our study makes a novel comparison of the effects of a natural nectar
   secondary compound on three pollinator species and clearly demonstrates
   drastic variation in the responses of different key pollinator taxa to a
   nectar toxin. Our findings are thus in congruence with literature
   demonstrating the varying effects of invasive plant chemistry on native
   foliar herbivores, and our work demonstrates that nectar chemistry
   should be taken into account when determining the impacts of plant
   invasion for native pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{High concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a chemical
   compound released by lysed phytoplankton, may indicate high rates of
   grazing by zooplankton and may thus be a foraging cue for planktivorous
   fishes. Previous studies have shown that some planktivorous fishes and
   birds aggregate or alter locomotory behavior in response to this
   chemical cue, which is likely adaptive because it helps them locate
   prey. These behavioral responses have been demonstrated in juveniles and
   adults, but no studies have tested for effects on larval fish. Larvae
   suffer from high mortality rates and are vulnerable to starvation. While
   larvae are generally thought to be visual predators, they actually have
   poor vision and cryptic prey. Thus, larval fish should benefit from a
   chemical cue that provides information on prey abundance. We reared
   larval sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, for one week and supplemented
   feedings with varying concentrations of DMSP to test the hypothesis that
   DMSP affects larval survival. Ecologically relevant DMSP concentrations
   increased larval survival by up to 70 \%, which has implications for
   production in aquaculture and recruitment in nature. These results
   provide a new tool for increasing larval production in aquaculture and
   also suggest that larvae may use DMSP as an olfactory cue. The release
   of DMSP may be a previously unappreciated mechanism through which
   phytoplankton affect larval survival and recruitment.}},

   ungulates to encounters with lions}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Prey mortality depends on the likelihood of encountering a predator and
   of being killed following such an encounter. While the proactive
   responses of large herbivores to the risk of predation have been well
   documented, the reactive responses of prey following encounters have
   been less well studied and restricted mostly to northern temperate
   ecosystems. We postulated that the reactive response should depend on
   the habitat selection of the prey species as well as the hunting tactic
   (cursorial versus stalking) of the predator. We investigated the
   reactive responses of a selective grazer, the blue wildebeest,
   Connochaetes taurinus, and a generalist grazer, the plains zebra, Equus
   quagga, to encounters with lions, Panthera leo, their main predator, in
   Kruger National Park. We used simultaneous global positioning system
   (GPS) locations of prey and predators to identify encounters and assess
   their frequency and characteristics (e.g. time of day). We compared both
   the immediate response (stay or flee) and subsequent movement (remain in
   the habitat patch or relocate) of the two ungulate species following
   encounters with lions. Despite being more predictably located in open
   short grass areas, wildebeest encountered lions no more frequently than
   zebra. However, being more selective for these particular habitat types,
   wildebeest more often stayed near the encounter site than zebra.
   Specifically, wildebeest were less likely to leave when located in more
   open areas with short grass providing both high-quality food and little
   concealment for stalking lions. We suggest that this is because
   wildebeest incur higher risks and greater feeding costs than zebra
   should they relocate, owing to their narrower preference for areas of
   short grass. Our findings show how the adaptive responses of wildebeest
   and zebra following encounters with their major predator depend on their
   habitat requirements. (c) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Animal models of obesity are numerous and diverse in terms of
   identifying specific neural and peripheral mechanisms related to
   obesity; however, they are limited when it comes to behavior. The
   standard behavioral measure of food intake in most animal models occurs
   in a free-feeding environment. While easy and cost-effective for the
   researcher, the free-feeding environment omits some of the most
   important features of obesity-related food consumption namely,
   properties of food availability, such as effort and delay to obtaining
   food. Behavior economics expands behavioral measures of obesity animal
   models by identifying such behavioral mechanisms. First, economic demand
   analysis allows researchers to understand the role of effort in food
   procurement, and how physiological and neural mechanisms are related.
   Second, studies on delay discounting contribute to a growing literature
   that shows that sensitivity to delayed food- and food-related outcomes
   is likely a fundamental process of obesity. Together, these data expand
   the animal model in a manner that better characterizes how environmental
   factors influence food consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Chelating agents, such as small peptides, can decrease free
   iron content and increase iron bioavailability. They may have promising
   therapeutic potential and may prevent the pro-oxidant effects of low
   molecular weight iron. Hairtail is a species of fish that is rich in
   easily digestible proteins. We extended this strategy for iron delivery
   by using an enzymatic hydrolysate of hairtail as the chelating agent and
   found that the ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides have anti-anaemic
   activity in Sprague-Dawley rats with anaemia.
   RESULTS: The anti-anaemic activity of ferrous-chelating hairtail
   peptides prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of the hairtail and ferrous
   chelation was studied in rat models of iron deficiency anaemia. After
   the end of the 35 d experiment, we noted significant differences in
   haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, haemoglobin distribution width,
   and ferritin concentrations between those animals supplemented with
   ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides and FeSO4 and healthy animals. There
   were no negative side effects on the animals' growth or behaviour. There
   was no obvious inflammation in the intestinal mucosa lamina propria and
   no unbalance of intestinal flora.
   CONCLUSION: The novel ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides may be a
   suitable fortificant for improving iron-deficiency status. Our findings
   demonstrated that this multi-tracer technique has many applications in
   nutritional research. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Title = {{Caddisfly behavioral responses to drying cues in temporary ponds:
   implications for effects of climate change}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{619-630}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aquatic organisms that live at high latitudes and elevations are
   especially vulnerable to climate-change induced alterations in snowpack,
   snowmelt, and evaporation rates, all of which affect basin filling and
   drying dates. Extraordinarily early drying events in shallow ponds and
   wetlands at our study sites prompted us to conduct 2 mesocosm
   experiments to document how proximate cues of drying modify agonistic
   behaviors among larvae of the caddisfly, Asynarchus nigriculus. Larvae
   are mainly detritivores but can be extremely aggressive and engage in
   mob cannibalism, perhaps to obtain a dietary supplement that hastens
   escape from drying basins. In one experiment, we manipulated caddisfly
   density to simulate the effects of crowding during pond drying. In a 2nd
   experiment, we reduced water levels and manipulated a protein supplement
   that mimics the dietary benefits of cannibalism. We quantified the
   effects of those manipulations on aggressive behaviors that are
   precursors to cannibalism and on development time to pupation. Frequency
   and duration of agonistic encounters increased as a function of larval
   density and, independent of density, were higher in drying than
   nondrying treatments, especially in the absence of a protein supplement.
   Pupation occurred earlier in high- than low-density treatments and
   earlier with than without a protein supplement. In contrast, the timing
   of pupation was not accelerated in drying compared with nondrying
   treatments, which might reflect the extreme diel temperature
   fluctuations in drying ponds, hence suboptimal growth conditions. Our
   findings provide evidence that declining water levels and crowding serve
   as cues that enable caddisflies to adjust behavior and development in
   the face of habitat drying. Early drying events observed in recent years
   may exceed the limits of this flexibility and portend the demise of
   populations in temporary habitats that historically supported this
   species.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{83-100}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies have examined how predator diets influence prey
   responses to predation risk, but the role predator diet plays in
   modulating prey responses remains equivocal. We reviewed 405
   predator-prey studies in 109 published articles that investigated
   changes in prey responses when predators consumed different prey items.
   In 54 \% of reviewed studies, prey responses were influenced by predator
   diet. The value of responding based on a predator's recent diet
   increased when predators specialized more strongly on particular prey
   species, which may create patterns in diet cue use among prey depending
   upon whether they are preyed upon by generalist or specialist predators.
   Further, prey can alleviate costs or accrue greater benefits using diet
   cues as secondary sources of information to fine tune responses to
   predators and to learn novel risk cues from exotic predators or alarm
   cues from sympatric prey species. However, the ability to draw broad
   conclusions regarding use of predator diet cues by prey was limited by a
   lack of research identifying molecular structures of the chemicals that
   mediate these interactions. Conclusions are also limited by a narrow
   research focus. Seventy percent of reviewed studies were performed in
   freshwater systems, with a limited range of model predator-prey systems,
   and 98 \% of reviewed studies were performed in laboratory settings.
   Besides identifying the molecules prey use to detect predators, future
   studies should strive to manipulate different aspects of prey responses
   to predator diet across a broader range of predator-prey species,
   particularly in marine and terrestrial systems, and to expand studies
   into the field.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Cardiovascular and metabolic traits (CMT) are influenced by
   complex interactive processes including diet, lifestyle, and genetic
   predisposition. The present study investigated the interactions of these
   risk factors in relation to CMTs in the Turkish population.
   Methods: We applied bootstrap agglomerative hierarchical clustering and
   Bayesian network learning algorithms to identify the causative
   relationships among genes involved in different biological mechanisms
   (i.e., lipid metabolism, hormone metabolism, cellular detoxification,
   aging, and energy metabolism), lifestyle (i.e., physical activity,
   smoking behavior, and metropolitan residency), anthropometric traits
   (i.e., body mass index, body fat ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio), and
   dietary habits (i.e., daily intakes of macro- and micronutrients) in
   relation to CMTs (i.e., health conditions and blood parameters).
   Results: We identified significant correlations between dietary habits
   (soybean and vitamin B12 intakes) and different cardiometabolic diseases
   that were confirmed by the Bayesian network learning algorithm. Genetic
   factors contributed to these disease risks also through the pleiotropy
   of some genetic variants (i.e., F5 rs6025 and MTR rs180508). However, we
   also observed that certain genetic associations are indirect since they
   are due to the causative relationships among the CMTs (e.g., APOC3
   rs5128 is associated with low-density lipoproteins cholesterol and, by
   extension, total cholesterol).
   Conclusions: Our study applied a novel approach to integrate various
   sources of information and dissect the complex interactive processes

   upper stomach of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus larva}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Digestive cells are present in all metazoans and provide the
   energy necessary for the whole organism. Pancreatic exocrine cells are a
   unique vertebrate cell type involved in extracellular digestion of a
   wide range of nutrients. Although the organization and regulation of
   this cell type is intensively studied in vertebrates, its evolutionary
   history is still unknown. In order to understand which are the elements
   that define the pancreatic exocrine phenotype, we have analyzed the
   expression of genes that contribute to specification and function of
   this cell-type in an early branching deuterostome, the sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.
   Results: We defined the spatial and temporal expression of sea urchin
   orthologs of pancreatic exocrine genes and described a unique population
   of cells clustered in the upper stomach of the sea urchin embryo where
   exocrine markers are co-expressed. We used a combination of perturbation
   analysis, drug and feeding experiments and found that in these cells of
   the sea urchin embryo gene expression and gene regulatory interactions
   resemble that of bona fide pancreatic exocrine cells. We show that the
   sea urchin Ptf1a, a key transcriptional activator of digestive enzymes
   in pancreatic exocrine cells, can substitute for its vertebrate ortholog
   in activating downstream genes.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our study is the first to show with molecular
   tools that defining features of a vertebrate cell-type, the pancreatic
   exocrine cell, are shared by a non-vertebrate deuterostome. Our results
   indicate that the functional cell-type unit of the vertebrate pancreas
   may evolutionarily predate the emergence of the pancreas as a discrete
   organ. From an evolutionary perspective, these results encourage to
   further explore the homologs of other vertebrate cell-types in
   traditional or newly emerging deuterostome systems.}},

   origin of novel pathways. Here, we investigate the function of the
   hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a highly conserved pathway best
   understood for its role in patterning anterior/posterior (A/P) polarity
   of diverse traits, in the developmental evolution of beetle horns, an
   evolutionary novelty, and horn polyphenisms, a highly derived form of
   environment-responsive trait induction. We show that interactions among
   pathway members are conserved during development of Onthophagus horned
   beetles and have retained the ability to regulate A/P polarity in
   traditional appendages, such as legs. At the same time, the Hh signaling
   pathway has acquired a novel and highly unusual role in the
   nutrition-dependent regulation of horn polyphenisms by actively
   suppressing horn formation in low-nutrition males. Down-regulation of Hh
   signaling lifts this inhibition and returns a highly derived sigmoid
   horn body size allometry to its presumed ancestral, linear state. Our
   results suggest that recruitment of the Hh signaling pathway may have
   been a key step in the evolution of trait thresholds, such as those
   involved in horn polyphenisms and the corresponding origin of
   alternative phenotypes and complex allometries.}},

Abstract = {{Several genera belonging to the nematode family Diplogastridae show
   characteristic dimorphism in their feeding structures; specifically,
   they have microbial feeding stenostomatous and predatory eurystomatous
   morphs. A diplogastrid satellite model species, Pristionchus pacificus,
   and its close relatives have become a model system for studying this
   phenotypic plasticity, with intensive physiological and structural
   studies having been undertaken. However, the many other species that are
   morphologically and phylogenetically divergent from P. pacificus have
   not been examined to date. In the present study, the detailed stomatal
   structure and induction of dimorphism in Neodiplogaster acaloleptae were
   examined. N. acaloleptae has a fungal feeding stenostomatous morph and a
   predatory eurystomatous morph. The predatory morph was induced by
   starvation, high population density, and coculturing with its potential
   prey, Caenorhabditis elegans. The feeding behavior of the stenostomatous
   and eurystomatous morphs of N. acaloleptae was confirmed, demonstrating
   that 1) the stomatal and pharyngeal movements of the two morphs were
   basically identical, and 2) the stomatal elements were protracted to cut
   open the hyphae and/or prey to feed when a N. acaloleptae flips its
   dorsal movable tooth dorsally and tilts its subventral stegostomatal
   cylinder ventrally, forming a pair of scissors to cut the food source.
   The stoma morphology of N. acaloleptae with a single movable tooth and a
   long stoma is markedly different from that of Pristionchus, which has
   two movable teeth and a short stoma. It is, however, similar to that of
   Mononchoides, tentatively a sister to Neodiplogaster.}},

Abstract = {{Animals use the sense of vision to scan their environment, respond to
   threats, and locate food sources. The neural computations underlying the
   selection of a particular behavior, such as escape or approach, require

   example, avoiding novel visual objects reduces predation risk but
   negatively affects foraging success. Zebrafish larvae approach small,
   moving objects ({''}prey'') and avoid large, looming objects
   ({''}predators''). We found that this binary classification of objects
   by size is strongly influenced by feeding state. Hunger shifts
   behavioral decisions from avoidance to approach and recruits additional
   prey-responsive neurons in the tectum, the main visual processing
   center. Both behavior and tectal function are modulated by signals from
   the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis and the serotonergic system.

Abstract = {{Understanding the decisions that animals make in the presence of
   predation risk can reveal their assessment of current and future
   reproductive options. The wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, has a
   conspicuous courtship display that is an indicator of male quality. In
   an initial experiment, we determined that male courtship was highly
   repeatable and correlated with symmetry. We then used symmetry as an
   indicator of quality to explore the reactions of males when presented
   with simulated predation risk and an attractive virgin female. There
   were no differences in courtship features between risk and no risk
   treatments unless we took into account male quality. High-quality males
   reduced courtship intensity under risk conditions suggesting that they
   estimated their long-term fitness prospects as strong. This response is
   consistent with the asset protection principle, which suggests that
   animals with high value traits should behave cautiously. Low-quality
   males courted at high levels under predation risk, which seemed to be
   reckless attempts to attract females. This response is analogous to the
   ``desperado effect,{''} which is one explanation for vigorous fighting
   by inferior animals in contests. Although females used behavior to
   select males when no predator information was present, they seemed to
   use symmetry in the presence of predator cues. The ability of females to
   select the most attractive males suggests that they can accurately
   assess male quality under laboratory conditions. High courting
   ``desperado{''} males may occasionally be selected in more complex
   environments and/or when they are in competition with other males.}},

Abstract = {{How animals trade-off food availability and predation threats is a
   strong determinant of animal activity and behavior; however, the
   majority of work on this topic has been on individual animals, despite
   the modulating effect the presence of conspecifics can have on both
   foraging and predation risk. Although these environmental factors (food
   and predation threat) vary spatially within habitats, they also vary
   temporally, and in marine habitats, this can be determined by not only
   the diel cycle but also the tidal cycle. Humbug damselfish, Dascyllus
   aruanus, live in small groups of unrelated individuals within and around
   branching coral heads, which they collectively withdraw into to escape a
   predation threat. In this study, we measured the proportion of
   individuals in the colony that were outside the coral head before and
   after they were scared by a fright stimulus and compared the responses
   at high tide (HT) and low tide (LT). We found that a greater proportion
   of the shoal emerged after the fright stimulus at HT and in larger

   of emergence over time and discovered the rate of emergence was faster

Abstract = {{Soft sediments in coastal shallow waters constitute nursery habitats for
   juveniles of several flatfishes. The quality of a nursery is defined by
   its capacity to optimize the growth and the survival of juvenile fish.
   The influence of biotic factors, such as food availability, is poorly
   studied at the scale of a nursery ground. Whether food availability
   limits juvenile survival is still uncertain. A spatial approach is used
   to understand the influence of food availability on the distribution of
   juvenile fish of various benthic and demersal species in the Bay of
   Vilaine (France), a productive nursery ground. We quantified the spatial
   overlap between benthic macro-invertebrates and their predators
   (juvenile fish) to assess if the latter were spatially covering the most
   productive areas of the Bay. Three scenarios describing the shapes of
   the predator prey spatial relationship were tested to quantify the
   strength of the relationship and consequently the importance of food
   availability in determining fish distribution. Our results underline
   that both.food availability and fish densities vary greatly over the
   nursery ground. When considering small organisational levels (e.g., a
   single fish species), the predator prey spatial relationship was not
   dear, likely because of additional environmental effects not identified
   here; but at larger organisational level (the whole juvenile fish
   community), a strong overlap between the fish predators and their prey
   was identified. The evidence that fish concentrate in sectors with high
   food availability suggests that either food is the limiting factor in
   that nursery or/and fish display behavioural responses by optimising
   their energetic expenditures associated with foraging. Further
   investigations are needed to test the two hypotheses and to assess the
   impact of benthic and demersal juvenile fish in the food web of coastal
   nurseries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities can impact animal communities by altering species
   interactions. The influence of forest harvesting on the interaction
   between threatened boreal caribou, moose, and wolves constitutes a
   classic example. When conifer forests are logged, clear-cuts are
   colonized by deciduous vegetation that provides high-quality food for
   moose. Subsequent changes in wolf distribution alter predation risk for
   caribou. Given that primary productivity varies along latitudinal
   gradients, the effects of logging on moose-caribou-wolf interactions
   could also vary moving northwards. Empirical evidence, however, is
   lacking and current recommendations for caribou conservation are fixed
   over space. We assessed whether the impact of logging activities on
   caribou-moose-wolf interactions varies with latitude. We estimated
   deciduous vegetation availability from satellite imagery, and followed
   all three species with GPS collars to evaluate their habitat selection.
   We found that the availability of deciduous vegetation in logged stands
   decreased along a 400-km latitudinal gradient. The probability of
   caribou occurrence remained low in clear-cuts, regardless of deciduous
   vegetation availability. Moose and wolves increased their selection for
   clear-cuts as they contained more deciduous vegetation. Accordingly, the
   relative co-occurrence probability of moose and wolves was strongly
   associated with clear-cuts at low latitudes, but weakly so at high
   latitudes. Clear-cuts should therefore attract moose and wolves more
   strongly to prime boreal caribou habitat at lower latitudes, and caribou
   predation risk should follow similar geographical patterns. Conservation
   planning should account for geographical patterns in the risk faced by
   threatened populations because the effectiveness of strategies developed
   from average patterns can decrease over space, in consistent manner. (C)

   dietary fat. Rather than simply decreasing the consumption of total fat,
   it is suggested that the consumption of saturated and trans fatty acid
   is less than 7\% and 1\%, respectively, of total daily calories. To
   reduce serum total triglycerides, the consumption of dietary
   carbohydrates is advised not to take excessive, and in particular a
   reduction in the consumption of simple sugars. The consumption of
   dietary fiber, which is rich in foods such as whole grains and
   vegetables, is recommended at 25 grams per day. Also, based on studies
   on the relationship between disease and dietary patterns, it is advised
   to maintain a diverse and balanced diet that includes vegetables,
   fruits, dairy products and whole grains, rather than a diet consisting

Abstract = {{Analysing population genomic data from killer whale ecotypes, which we
   estimate have globally radiated within less than 250,000 years, we show
   that genetic structuring including the segregation of potentially

   bottlenecks during founder events, likely promoting ecological
   divergence and genetic drift resulting in a wide range of genome-wide

   Functional enrichment analyses provided evidence for regional genomic
   divergence associated with habitat, dietary preferences and post-zygotic

Abstract = {{The ways in which animal societies respond to threat has enormous
   consequences for their success. In the present study, we investigated
   how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus
   dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how
   their responses change with experience with important predators,
   Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a
   mixture of `bold' and `shy' personality types exhibited twice as much
   defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony
   defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience
   with predators for `mixed' colonies than for either monotypic
   composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals
   were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus,
   colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to
   experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally
   observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to
   determine which individual traits were associated with task
   participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology
   and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level,
   with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the
   attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making.
   Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting
   participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between
   colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence
   that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in
   situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively
   associated with colony persistence during attacks. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to
   different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether
   these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare.
   Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive
   success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the
   exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests
   and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour
   (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness
   were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal
   component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the
   females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in
   two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014
   we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our
   results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected
   by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which
   may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female
   reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was
   only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at
   the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was
   additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food
   availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and
   explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We
   conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of
   the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive
   impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food
   availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of
   personality on reproductive success differed between changing
   environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that
   different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by
   varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Individuals within groups benefit when they are phenotypically and
   behaviourally similar. Despite this, mixed-species aggregations are
   found among a wide range of animal taxa and are known to provide
   advantages in terms of enhanced foraging efficiency and predator
   avoidance. However, little is known about individual level interactions
   within these groups or the mechanisms mediating their structure.
   Diet-derived chemical cues can mediate within-species associations in
   fish, but it is not known whether they serve a similar function across
   species. To investigate this, we created mixed-species groups of
   sympatric three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and nine-spined
   (Pungitius pungitius) sticklebacks and manipulated the diet of the
   constituent group members. We found that three-spined sticklebacks did
   not associate more frequently with conspecifics over heterospecifics
   when all animals received the same diet, suggesting that
   species-specific cues did not influence association patterns. However,
   when group members were fed different diets, they interacted with
   heterospecifics fed on the same diet more than with conspecifics from a
   different diet treatment. This study demonstrates the importance of
   chemical cues as a possible mechanism for establishing familiarity, and
   thereby mediating within-group structure even between individuals in
   mixed-species aggregations. Understanding these underlying mechanisms
   has significant implications for our understanding of other social
   dynamics, including social learning and information transfer.
   Mixed-species groupings are common among animals, although we have a
   poor understanding of how these groups are structured, what mediates
   interactions between group members, and what the function of such groups
   is. In a study using two co-occurring stickleback species, we show that
   fish preferred to associate with shoal members fed the same diet as
   themselves, irrespective of their species. This is most likely mediated
   by diet-derived chemical cues and may allow fish to avoid detection by
   predators or forage alongside individuals with similar dietary
   preferences. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning non-random
   associations in mixed-species groups has significant implications for
   our understanding of other social dynamics, including social learning
   and information transfer.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesize that anorexia nervosa (AN) poses a physiological stress.
   Therefore, the way an individual copes with stress may affect AN
   vulnerability. Since prenatal stress (PNS) exposure alters stress
   responsivity in offspring this may increase their risk of developing AN.
   We tested this hypothesis using the activity based anorexia (ABA) rat
   model in control and PNS rats that were characterized by either
   proactive or passive stress-coping behavior.
   We found that PNS passively coping rats ate less and lost more weight
   during the ABA paradigm. Exposure to ABA resulted in higher baseline
   corticosterone and lower insulin levels in all groups. However, leptin
   levels were only decreased in rats with a proactive stress-coping style.
   Similarly, ghrelin levels were increased only in proactively coping ABA
   rats. Neuropeptide Y (Npy) expression was increased and
   proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) expression was decreased in all rats exposed
   to ABA. In contrast, agouti related peptide (Agrp) and orexin (Hctr)
   expression were increased in all but the PNS passively coping ABA rats.
   Furthermore, DNA methylation of the orexin gene was increased after ABA
   in proactive coping rats and not in passive coping rats.
   Overall our study suggests that passive PNS rats have innate impairments
   in leptin and ghrelin in responses to starvation combined with prenatal
   stress associated impairments in Agrp and orexin expression in response
   to starvation. These impairments may underlie decreased food intake and
   associated heightened body weight loss during ABA in the passively
   coping PNS rats. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{620-632}},

Abstract = {{Development is a continuous process during which individuals gain
   information about their environment and adjust their phenotype
   accordingly. In many natural systems, individuals are particularly
   sensitive to early life experiences, even in the absence of later
   constraints on plasticity. Recent models have highlighted how the
   adaptive use of information can explain age-dependent plasticity. These
   models assume that information gain and phenotypic adjustments either
   cannot occur simultaneously or are completely independent. This
   assumption is not valid in the context of growth, where finding food
   results both in a size increase and learning about food availability.
   Here, we describe a simple model of growth to provide proof of principle
   that long-term effects of early life experiences can arise through the
   coupled dynamics of information acquisition and phenotypic change in the
   absence of direct constraints on plasticity. The increase in
   reproductive value from gaining information and sensitivity of behavior
   to experiences declines across development. Early life experiences have
   long-term impacts on age of maturity, yet-due to compensatory changes in
   behavior-our model predicts no substantial effects on reproductive
   success. We discuss how the evolution of sensitive windows can be
   explained by experiences having short-term effects on informational and
   phenotypic states, which generate long-term effects on life-history
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat selection is a complex process, which involves behavioural
   decisions guided by the multiple needs and constraints faced by
   individuals. Climate-induced changes in environmental conditions may
   alter those trade-offs and resulting habitat use patterns.
   2. In this study, we investigated the effect of sea temperature on
   habitat selection and habitat use of acoustically tagged Atlantic cod
   (Gadus morhua) at the Norwegian Skagerrak coast.
   3. Significant relationships between ocean temperature and habitat
   selection and use were found. Under favourable sea temperature
   thresholds (< 16 degrees C), cod selected vegetated habitats, such as
   eelgrass and macroalgae beds, available in shallow areas. Selection for
   those habitats was especially high at night, when cod tended to ascend
   to shallower areas, presumably to feed. Selection and use of those
   habitats decreased significantly as temperature rose. Under increased
   sea surface temperature conditions, cod were absent from vegetated
   shallow habitats, both during the day and night, and selected instead
   non-vegetated rocky bottoms and sand habitats, available in deeper,
   colder areas.
   4. This study shows the dynamic nature of habitat selection and strongly
   suggests that cod in this region have to trade off food availability
   against favourable temperature conditions. Future increases in ocean
   temperature are expected to further influence the spatial behaviour of
   marine fish, potentially affecting individual fitness and population

Abstract = {{Phenological advances and trophic mismatches are frequently reported
   ecological consequences of climate warming. Trophic mismatches occur
   when phenological responses to environmental conditions differ among
   trophic levels such that the timing of resource demand by consumers
   becomes decoupled from supply. We used 25 years of demographic
   measurements of a migratory songbird (the black-throated blue warbler
   Setophaga caerulescens) to compare its breeding phenology to the
   phenology of both its caterpillar prey and the foliage on which
   caterpillars feed. Caterpillar biomass in this forest did not show a
   predictable seasonal pulse. Nest initiation by warblers in this northern
   hardwood forest was therefore not timed to coincide with a peak in food
   availability for nestlings. Nonetheless, timing of first clutches was
   strongly associated with spring leaf expansion (slope +/- SE = 0.56 +/-
   0.08 days per day of change in leaf phenology, R-2 = 0.66). Warblers
   adjusted the timing of breeding to early springs mainly by shortening
   the interval between arrival and clutch initiation, but this likely has
   limits because recent early springs are approaching the relatively
   inflexible dates when birds arrive on the breeding grounds. Although the
   timing of first nests did not match 1:1 with leaf-out phenology, the
   adjustments in breeding time maximized mean annual reproductive success.
   Nest predation had the greatest effect on annual reproductive success,
   but the ability of nesting warblers to appropriately track leaf
   phenology accounted for effects on annual reproductive success
   comparable to the influence of variation in caterpillar abundance and
   conspecific density. Nesting phenology in black-throated blue warblers
   was generally well matched to the timing of leaf-out, even though the
   match was not 1:1. Without measurements of reproductive success, these
   unequal phenological shifts might otherwise have been interpreted as
   having negative ecological consequences.}},

Abstract = {{In the face of starvation, animals will engage in high-risk behaviors
   that would normally be considered maladaptive. Starving rodents, for

   involves circuits that link innate feeding, aggression and fear.
   Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are
   critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain
   regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping
   techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a
   subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the
   amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,

Abstract = {{Obesity is a persistent and pervasive problem, particularly in
   industrialized nations. It has come to be appreciated that the metabolic
   health of an individual can influence brain function and subsequent
   behavioral patterns. To examine the relationship between metabolic
   phenotype and central systems that regulate behavior, we tested rats
   with divergent metabolic phenotypes (Low Capacity Runner: LCR vs. High
   Capacity Runner: HCR) for behavioral responses to the conflict between
   hunger and environmental novelty using the novelty suppressed feeding
   (NSF) paradigm. Additionally, we measured expression of mRNA, for
   peptides involved in energy management, in response to fasting.
   Following a 24-h fast, LCR rats showed lower latencies to begin eating
   in a novel environment compared to HCR rats. A 48-h fast equilibrated
   the latency to begin eating in the novel environment. A 24-h fast
   differentially affected expression of cocaine-amphetamine regulated
   transcript (CART) mRNA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), where 24-h of
   fasting reduced CART mRNA in LCR rats. Bilateral microinjections of CART
   55-102 peptide into the NAc increased the latency to begin eating in the
   NSF paradigm following a 24-h fast in LCR rats. These results indicate
   that metabolic phenotype influences how animals cope with the conflict
   between hunger and novelty, and that these differences are at least
   partially mediated by CART signaling in the NAc. For individuals with
   poor metabolic health who have to navigate food-rich and stressful
   environments, changes in central systems that mediate conflicting drives
   may feed into the rates of obesity and exacerbate the difficulty
   individuals have in maintaining weight loss. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

   cuticular bacterial transmission from exposed individuals to susceptible

   the interactions of resting individuals of known behavioural types, we
   assessed whether individuals assorted according to their behavioural
   traits. We found that individuals preferentially interacted with
   individuals of unlike behavioural phenotypes. We next applied a green
   fluorescent protein-transformed cuticular bacterium, Pantoea sp., to
   individuals and allowed them to interact with an unexposed colonymate
   for 24 h. We found evidence for transmission of bacteria in 55\% of
   cases. The likelihood of transmission was influenced jointly by the
   behavioural phenotypes of both the exposed and susceptible individuals:
   transmission was more likely when exposed spiders exhibited higher
   `boldness' relative to their colony-mate, and when unexposed individuals
   were in better body condition. Indirect transmission via shared silk
   took place in only 15\% of cases. Thus, bodily contact appears key to
   transmission in this system. These data represent a fundamental step

Abstract = {{We examine the mechanistic basis and wider implications of adopting a

   processes, for example if maintenance and repair processes in the period
   up to reproduction are traded off against later decline in function. A
   life course model places ageing in the context of the attainment of peak
   capacity for a body system, starting in early development when
   plasticity permits changes in structure and function induced by a range
   of environmental stimuli, followed by a period of decline, the rate of
   which depends on the peak attained as well as the later life conditions.
   Such path dependency in the rate of ageing may offer new insights into
   its modification. Focusing on musculoskeletal and cardiovascular
   function, we discuss this model and the possible underlying mechanisms,
   including endothelial function, oxidative stress, stem cells and
   nutritional factors such as vitamin D status. Epigenetic changes induced
   during developmental plasticity, and immune function may provide a
   common mechanistic process underlying a life course model of ageing. The
   life course trajectory differs in high and low resource settings. New
   insights into the developmental components of the life course model of
   ageing may lead to the design of biomarkers of later chronic disease
   risk and to new interventions to promote healthy ageing, with important
   implications for public health.}},

   adaptation to diet shifts in the ladybird Cryptolaemus montrouzieri}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite the broad diet range of many predatory ladybirds,
   the mechanisms involved in their adaptation to diet shifts are not
   completely understood. Here, we explored how a primarily coccidophagous
   ladybird Cryptolaemus montrouzieri adapts to feeding on aphids.
   Results: Based on the lower survival rate, longer developmental time,
   and lower adult body weight and reproduction rate of the predator, the
   aphid Megoura japonica proved being less suitable to support C.
   montrouzieri as compared with the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri. The
   results indicated up-regulation of genes related to ribosome and
   translation in fourth instars, which may be related to their suboptimal
   development. Also, several genes related to biochemical transport and
   metabolism, and detoxification were up-regulated as a result of
   adaptation to the changes in nutritional and non-nutritional (toxic)
   components of the prey.
   Conclusion: Our results indicated that C. montrouzieri succeeded in
   feeding on aphids by regulation of genes related to development,
   digestion and detoxification. Thus, we argue that these candidate genes
   are valuable for further studies of the functional evolution of
   ladybirds led by diet shifts.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, the nontrivial cost of ejaculate production has led
   males to evolve prudent reproductive strategies in the form of
   precopulatory mating bias and/or cryptic ejaculate allocation.
   Behaviours determining male reproductive success, such as courtship and
   aggression, also impose substantial costs potentially selecting for
   plasticity in these traits. Here, using laboratory-adapted populations
   of Drosophila melanogaster, we investigated whether males show
   plasticity in these behaviours in response to the changes in their
   perception of future risk of competition (generated by varying the
   number of rivals). We show that males exhibited nonlinear plasticity in
   their aggressive behaviour. Males subjected to intermediate risk were
   found to show the maximum level of aggression compared to those
   subjected to low and high risk. Such plasticity in aggression did not
   lead to any variation in mating success but significantly increased the
   cost of reproduction. We also found a similar trend in courtship
   behaviour. While our results on copulation duration confirmed the
   previously reported plasticity, we did not find any effect of the
   treatment on mating latency. To the best of our knowledge this is the
   first empirical evidence showing plasticity in aggression in response to
   perceived risk of future competition and its relation to the cost of

Abstract = {{Rates of innovative foraging behaviours and success on problem-solving
   tasks are often used to assay differences in cognition, both within and
   across species. Yet the cognitive features of some problem-solving tasks
   can be unclear. As such, explanations that attribute cognitive
   mechanisms to individual variation in problem-solving performance have
   revealed conflicting results. We investigated individual consistency in
   problem-solving performances in captive-reared pheasant chicks,
   Phasianus colchicus, and addressed whether success depends on cognitive
   processes, such as trial-and-error associative learning, or whether
   performances may be driven solely via noncognitive motivational
   mechanisms, revealed through subjects' willingness to approach, engage
   with and persist in their interactions with an apparatus, or via
   physiological traits such as body condition. While subjects'
   participation and success were consistent within the same problems and
   across similar tasks, their performances were inconsistent across
   different types of task. Moreover, subjects' latencies to approach each
   test apparatus and their attempts to access the reward were not
   repeatable across trials. Successful individuals did not improve their
   performances with experience, nor were they consistent in their
   techniques in repeated presentations of a task. However, individuals
   that were highly motivated to enter the experimental chamber were more
   likely to participate. Successful individuals were also faster to
   approach each test apparatus and more persistent in their attempts to
   solve the tasks than unsuccessful individuals. Our findings therefore
   suggest that individual differences in problem-solving success can arise

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{231-239}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The rate at which infants develop can vary within species. This
   variation may be due to differences between infants in their nutritional
   intake and physiology, or the ability of females to adjust the amount
   and timing of maternal investment to maximize their lifetime
   reproductive success. This is the first primate study that uses a large
   sample size and multivariate analyses to investigate whether variation
   in early infant development (measured visually using durations of natal
   coat stages) is explained by differences in infanticide pressure,
   predation pressure or feeding competition among mothers. We recorded the
   number of days that infants took to transition through each of the two
   natal coat stages (white to grey: N = 32; grey to black-and-white: N =
   22), as well as through their entire natal coats (white to
   black-and-white: N = 38) in a population of wild ursine colobus, Colobus
   vellerosus. Infant males, which are at greater risk of infanticidal
   attacks, transitioned coat colours earlier than females, and infants in
   multimale groups, where infanticide occurs more frequently, transitioned
   earlier than infants in unimale groups. Variation in group size did not
   affect natal coat durations, which suggests that the intensity of
   predation risk and feeding competition do not influence development.
   Instead of terminating investment in offspring before birth, as in the
   `Bruce effect', females may invest more heavily in infants after birth
   in order to speed up infant development and reduce the time period
   during which offspring are the most vulnerable to infanticide. Mothers
   may therefore have flexible means of exerting choice over maternal
   investment in relation to infanticide risk. However, the extent to which
   mothers and infants are responsible for adjusting the speed of
   development is unknown. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Appetitive traits and general temperament traits
   have both been correlated with adiposity and obesity in children.
   However, very few studies have tested structural models to identify the
   links between temperament, appetitive traits and adiposity in children.
   A validated structural model would help suggesting mechanisms to explain
   the impact of temperament on body mass index (BMI). In this study, we
   used Rothbart's heuristic definition of temperament as a starting point
   to define four appetitive traits, including two appetite reactivity
   dimensions (Appetite Arousal and Appetite Persistence) and two
   dimensions of self-regulation in eating (Self-regulation In Eating
   Without Hunger and Self-regulation in Eating Speed). We conducted a
   cross-sectional study in young adolescents to validate a structural
   model including these four appetitive traits, Effortful Control (a
   general temperament trait) and adiposity.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: A questionnaire assessing the four appetitive trait
   dimensions and Effortful Control was completed by adolescents from 10 to
   14 years old (n = 475), and their BMI-for-age was calculated (n = 441).
   In total, 74\% of the study participants were normal weight, 26\% were
   overweight and 8\% were obese. We then used structural equation
   modelling to test the structural model.
   RESULTS: We identified a well-fitting structural model (Comparative Fit
   Index = 0.91; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.04) that
   supports the hypothesis that Effortful Control impacts both dimensions
   of self-regulation in eating, which in turn are linked with both
   appetite reactivity dimensions. Moreover, Appetite Persistence is the
   only appetitive trait that was significantly related to adiposity (B =
   0.12; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that Effortful Control is related to
   adiposity through the mediation of an individual's `eating temperament'
   (appetite reactivity and self-regulation in eating). Results suggest
   that young adolescents who exhibit high appetite reactivity but a low
   level of self-regulation in eating are at higher risk for excess
   adiposity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite many advances in management and housing of dairy calves, 1 in 10
   US dairy heifers die before weaning. A better understanding of the
   internal and external stimuli that contribute to the physiological and
   behavioral responses of calves to stressors is needed to reduce the risk
   of morbidity and mortality. Feeding calves their first meal is crucial,
   as successful passive transfer reduces the risk of mortality and
   morbidity. Sexually dimorphic immune and stress responses appear to be
   present in young cattle, but more research is needed to determine if
   this is caused by human bias for female calves. After that first
   feeding, 1 in 10 heifers and most bull calves in the United States are
   transported to specialized calf-raising facilities, yet information is
   lacking on the newborn calf stress response during transit. Whether
   calves are raised on site or at a calf ranch, individual housing systems
   are commonly used in the United States to reduce the risk of pathogen
   exposure and provide individual feeding and health-care. However,
   health, growth, and social implications may be present for calves in
   alternative systems with greater space allowance than conventional
   systems or group housing. Disbudding and castration are typically
   performed at an early age for dairy calves during the pre-wean stage.
   These stressors often take place when the calf has decreased passive
   transfer of Ig and immunity is developing. Availability of pain
   mitigation through anesthetics and analgesics is limited, but evidence
   indicates that analgesics attenuate suppressed leukocyte function during
   these procedures. Solid-feed intake is a primary measure for determining
   weaning readiness, but some milk replacer formulas may influence the
   calf's oral behaviors before weaning; therefore, alternate weaning
   methods may need to coincide with alternate milk replacer, formulas. The
   calf's behavioral and stress response at weaning may influence its
   immunity during the transition from individual to group housing
   (commingling). Alternate commingling strategies and nutritional
   supplements may help with this transition, but more research is needed
   to explore feasible alternatives. Optimizing the calf's health and
   well-being at these early stages may improve its long-term health and
   welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Responsive feeding has been identified as important in preventing
   overconsumption by infants. However, this is predicated on an assumption
   that parents recognise and respond to infant feeding cues. Despite this,
   relatively little is understood about how infants engage parental
   feeding responses. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to
   identify what is known about infant communication of hunger and
   satiation and what issues impact on the expression and perception of
   these states. A search of Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO,
   Science Direct and Maternal and Infant care produced 27 papers.
   Eligibility criteria included peer reviewed qualitative and/or
   quantitative publications on feeding behaviours, hunger, and
   satiation/satiety cues of typically developing children in the first
   2years of life. Papers published between 1966 and 2013 were included in
   the review. The review revealed that feeding cues and behaviours are
   shaped by numerous issues, such as infants' physical attributes,
   individual psychological factors and environmental factors. Meanwhile,
   infant characteristics, external cues and mothers' own characteristics
   affect how feeding cues are perceived. The existing literature provides
   insights into many aspects of hunger and satiation in infancy; however,
   there are significant gaps in our knowledge. There is a lack of
   validated tools for measuring hunger and satiation, a need to understand
   how different infant characteristics impact on feeding behaviour and a
   need to extricate the respective contributions of infant and maternal
   characteristics to perceptions of hunger and satiation. Further research
   is also recommended to differentiate between feeding driven by liking
   and that driven by hunger.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the prevalence and incidence of
   traditional eating disorders (EDs, e.g., anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia
   nervosa and binge eating disorder (BED)) in individuals with childhood
   onset neuropsychiatric disorders, including
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). The aim of the present study was to examine the
   prevalence of EDs and eating pathology in young adults and adults with
   ADHD and/or ASD, and to investigate the relationship between EDs and
   associated symptoms, on the one hand, and other psychiatric disorders,
   intelligence, and BMI, on the other hand, in this population.
   Methods: In an outpatient setting, 228 consecutively referred adults
   were neuropsychiatrically evaluated and assessed with regard to
   intelligence (WAIS-III), psychiatric comorbidities (SCID-I), personality
   disorders (SCID-II), eating disorders (SCID-I) and eating pathology
   (Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)).
   Results: For the entire sample, a total of 18 individuals (7.9\%) had a
   current or previous eating disorder, with AN and BED being the most
   frequent. The male:female ratio was 1:2.5. According to EAT, 10.1\% of
   the individuals scored within the range of severely disturbed eating
   behavior, and 13\% moderately disturbed eating behavior. Individuals
   with ADHD more often affirmed eating pathology such as focusing on
   thoughts of calories and body dissatisfaction compared to individuals
   with ASD.
   Conclusions: Eating disorder symptomatology seems to be overrepresented
   in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders compared with the general
   population. The gender ratio for EDs in adults with neuropsychiatric
   disorders is not nearly as skewed as in the general population. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The study of primates living in novel environments represents an
   interesting context in which to examine patterns of behavioral and
   ecological flexibility. Our research focused on an understudied,
   anthropogenically introduced primate population living in Florida, USA:
   the Silver River rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). To better understand
   how this population has adapted to life in Florida's riparian woodlands,
   we collected data on the diet and size of the rhesus macaque population
   and its encounters with boaters along the Silver River from January to
   May 2013. Using scan sampling and all-occurrences sampling, we collected
   166 h of diet data and 105 h of human-macaque encounter data,
   respectively. We confirmed previous reports that four social groups
   comprise the Silver River macaque population, totaling 118 individuals.
   The Silver River macaques predominantly consumed leaves and other
   vegetative plant parts (87.5 \%), with ash trees serving as a staple
   food (66.5 \% of feeding records). Although human-macaque encounters
   were frequent (80 \% of 611 boats observed), only a small proportion of
   boats (11.5 \%) provisioned the macaques. Motorized boats (e.g., pontoon
   and motor boats) were more likely to provision, while kayaks and canoes
   were more likely to move in close proximity of the macaques situated at
   the river's edge. Our results indicate that the Silver River macaques
   have adjusted to life in the New World by adopting a temperate-dwelling
   feeding strategy and by incorporating locally available foods (e.g.,
   sedges) into their diet. They have also learned that the river's edge
   provides opportunities to receive provisions from boaters. However,
   because the rate of provisioning is low, these foods likely play a
   filler fallback role. Given that provisioning and direct contact between
   macaques and boaters are infrequent but proximity to the macaques is a
   concern, our findings have important implications for the management of
   the human-macaque interface along the Silver River and beyond.}},

   conclusions of the meta-analysis. The percentage of fish in the diet was
   greater for otters occupying standing water than for those occupying
   flowing water; was higher for otters in waterbodies overgrown by reed
   vegetation; and varied depending on the type of surrounding land use.
   However, the results of the meta-analysis varied depending on which of
   the two most common methods of diet analysis were used: percentage
   biomass or relative frequency of occurrence (RFO). We showed that the
   plasticity of otter feeding behaviour might be explained by the various
   habitats occupied by otters. Habitat differences reflected in otters'
   diets might have importance for the maintenance and conservation of
   local populations of this species. The high diversity of methods used by
   researchers to report the results of dietary studies precludes full
   comparisons and synthesis. This demonstrates the importance of
   unification of reporting. Moreover, the conclusions reached by the
   authors of any particular study might be highly dependent on the method
   they applied. Thus, care should be taken when comparing ecological
   studies based on different methods.}},

Abstract = {{1. Novel hosts present phytophagous insects with nutritional challenges
   which can cause host-associated divergence. 2. The performance of the
   Bog gum-Victorian metapopulation of Ctenarytaina bipartita Burckhardt et
   al. (Psylloidea:Aphalaridae), a psyllid whose range is being expanded by
   tree planting, on five species and genotypes of Eucalyptus endemic to
   south-eastern Australia was quantified. Settling of females on two
   non-hosts was also tested. 3. Female C. bipartita exhibited significant
   host-associated plasticity in proctiger length (the body part used for
   oviposition into apical buds). Psyllids with longer wings and proctigers
   arose from a primary host. Fecundity varied significantly among hosts
   and was highest on a novel host. Hosts did not differ significantly in
   free amino acids (FAAs) but did differ in concentrations of essential
   amino acids (EAAs). However, nymphs did not differ significantly in
   EAAs. Surprisingly, fecundity was not related to total FAAs,
   availability of EAAs or concentrations of EAAs but was related to
   concentrations of four non-EAAs. Mean fecundity per host was also
   positively related to the relative abundance of galloyl groups
   (associated with hydrolysable tannins). 4. Leaf age was more important
   to settling than eucalypt species; females settled on young leaves but
   this response was not related to leaf water content. 5. Planting the
   rare Eucalyptus kitsoniana in new habitats will expand the range of Bog
   gum-Victorian C. bipartita and provide a bridge for the colonisation of
   novel eucalypts with buds suitable for oviposition. Host expansion by
   this metapopulation is not constrained by nutritional quality and may
   result in morphological divergence.}},

Abstract = {{Child care facilities are prime locations for the transmission of

   (2) to determine what measures providers are taking to prevent the
   spread of infectious disease.
   This is a descriptive study. We used the Dillman total design method to
   survey a random sample of licensed family and residential child care
   providers. We used a 29-item questionnaire to ask about awareness of
   cytomegalovirus and other infectious diseases, knowledge of how to
   control spread of these diseases, sources of information, personal hand
   hygiene behaviors, and demographics. The response rate was 68.6 \%.
   Awareness of infectious diseases ranged from 12.8 to 99.4 \%; 18.5 \%
   `had' heard of CMV. Respondent's primary sources of information were
   health care providers and the Internet. Self-report of hand hygiene
   behavior was high. Providers do not know how to appropriately sanitize
   surfaces to reduce spread of disease.
   Awareness of CMV and how to prevent transmission of infectious disease
   is low. Intervening with child care providers and parents through child

Abstract = {{Maternal nutritional status (MNS) is a strong predictor of growth and
   development in the first 1000 days of life and may influence
   susceptibility to non-communicable diseases in adulthood. However, the
   role of nutrition during this window of developmental plasticity in
   Africa is unclear. This paper reviews published data to address whether
   maternal nutrition during the first 1000 days is important for Africa,
   with a focus on MNS and its associations with fetal growth and birth,
   neonatal and infant outcomes. A systematic approach was used to search
   the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google
   Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciSearch and Cochrane Library. In all, 26
   studies met the inclusion criteria for the specific objectives. MNS in
   Africa showed features typical of the epidemiological transition: higher
   prevalences of maternal overweight and obesity and lower underweight,
   poor diet quality 1 and high anaemia prevalence. Maternal body mass
   index and greater gestational weight gain (GWG) were positively
   associated with birth weight; however, maternal overweight and obesity
   were associated with increased risk of macrosomia and intrauterine
   growth restriction. Maternal anaemia was associated with lower birth
   weight. Macro- and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy were
   associated with improvements in GWG, birth weight and mortality risk.
   Data suggest poor MNS in Africa and confirms the importance of the first
   1000 days as a critical period for nutritional intervention to improve
   growth, birth outcomes and potential future health risk. However, there
   is a lack of data beyond birth and a need for longitudinal data through
   infancy to 2 years of age.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits is increasingly a
   focus for animal researchers, for which fish have become important
   models. Almost all of this work has been done in the context of
   evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability
   and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding
   conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree
   to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming
   performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context
   dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability
   (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability)
   and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when
   attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors
   such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia,
   flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in
   fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could
   alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve
   the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater
   understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to
   forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate
   change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited
   by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time
   scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in
   technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and
   biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased
   quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative
   traits, which so far lag behind measures of repeatability of behavioural
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{Copepod mating is a complex behavioral interplay between males and
   females. But successful mating also requires a physiological component
   in terms of eggand spermatophore production. In striking contrast to the
   extensive literature on copepod egg production, costs of spermatophore
   production has largely been ignored. This article explores the energetic
   demands in male copepod reproduction, testing how food and predation
   risk influence spermatophore production. Moreover, we analyse swimming
   behavior to test if predation risk and food act on reproductive
   investments via behavioral responses. We found that spermatophore
   production depends strongly on food availability. The copepods increased
   grazing rates with predation risk when food was limited, and video
   analyses revealed that males spend less time swimming in presence of a
   risk cue. A review of the few available spermatophore production rates
   suggests that food limits spermatophore production for copepods at
   large. Apparently, potential encounter rates with mates or predators did
   not influence spermatophore production. However, the reduced activity
   indicates a trade-off between risk avoidance and mate encounter,
   potentially influencing mating rates. This study shows that males invest
   considerable resources in each spermatophore, with implications for
   mating strategies and population dynamics in copepods, the most abundant
   metazoans on earth.}},

Abstract = {{Generalist predators typically have broad diets, but their diets may
   become constrained when one species of prey becomes disproportionately

   predators exhibit stereotypic relationships with pulsed prey resources.
   We used telemetry data from 959 woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus

   (Canis latrans Say, 1823), and 55 black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas,

   caribou neonates on the island of Newfoundland. We examined the
   similarity of patterns of habitat use between caribou and their
   predators across time and related this similarity to interspecific
   spatiotemporal co-occurrence and mortality risk for caribou neonates.
   The similarity in habitat use between coyotes and caribou mirrored
   variation in juvenile hazard risk, but had weak association with actual
   co-occurrence with caribou. Bears and caribou exhibited less similarity
   in habitat use during the calving season than coyotes and caribou. The
   relationship between habitat use of bear and caribou did not correspond
   with either co-occurrence patterns or overall risk for caribou neonates.
   Our work illustrates how risk for a prey species can be shaped

Abstract = {{Background: Sedentary time is an independent risk factor for chronic

   determine whether imposed sedentary time would alter typical behaviors

   sedentary-intervention (SIT, n = 8) group. SIT participants attended
   monitored sedentary sessions (8 wk, 10 h/wk). Assessments including diet

   There were no differences (P > .05) between CON and SIT groups for step
   counts or time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous physical
   activity when comparing a week during imposed sedentary time (week 4) to
   baseline and week 9. At week 4, caloric intake was not different from

Abstract = {{Animals reduce their exposure to predation often at the cost of
   nutritional inputs. A variety of predator avoidance strategies exist,
   but species generally exist along a spectrum with some primarily
   utilizing behavioral responses to avoid predation and others relying
   more on morphological defenses to deter predation. North American
   porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) possess a well-developed predator
   deterrent strategy (i.e., quills). During the winter, porcupines enter a
   nutritional bottleneck where they principally rely on endogenous stores
   to survive winter. We hypothesized that porcupine behavior in winter
   would, then, be primarily driven by nutritional demands rather than
   predation risk. To test this trade-off between perceived risk of
   predation and nutritional stress, we analyzed the length and sinuosity
   of movement patterns, relative to nutritional condition (urinary urea:
   creatinine), snow conditions (depth, density), and a risk landscape
   (predation risk and refuges). As predicted, the sinuosity of movement
   paths was unrelated to any of our variables, but we detected a strong
   correlation between lengths of movements with risk landscape.
   Specifically, the length of porcupine movement declined as the average
   risk of predation increased, and the presence of refuge trees in their
   movement path was positively related to path length. Thus, even for
   animals possessing extreme morphological defenses effective at deterring
   predation, and during a period of nutritional stress, movement and
   behavior are nevertheless driven by perceived predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Food choice has profound implications for the relative intakes of water
   and salts, and thus for an animal's physiological state. Discrimination
   behaviors with respect salt intake have been documented in a number of

   2-choice experiment designed to examine the influence of dietary salt
   content and freshwater availability in food discrimination behaviors in
   red knots Calidris canutus (Aves: Scolopacidae) that feed on mud snails
   Peringia ulvae (Gastropoda: Hydrobiidae) whose body fluids have either
   relatively low (25\%) or high (42\%) salinity. Birds ate more and spent
   longer time foraging on low-salinity mud snails when their salt gland
   sizes-an indicator of excretory capacity-were relatively small and when
   they were deprived of freshwater. However, as they enlarged salt
   glands-following a prolonged exposure to salty diet without access to
   freshwater-and regained access to freshwater, their preference for
   low-salinity prey disappeared. Such a change of preference illustrates
   the context dependency of discrimination. As the birds were able to
   maintain salt-water balance-inferred from plasma sodium
   concentration-under all conditions, changes in salinity preferences may
   occur without measurable physiological signs of osmotic stress. Our
   results highlight the importance of ecological context for understanding

Abstract = {{Parasites can increase their host's predation susceptibility. It is a
   long-standing puzzle, whether this is caused by host manipulation, an
   evolved strategy of the parasite, or by side effects due to, for
   example, the parasite consuming energy from its host thereby changing
   the host's trade-off between avoiding predation and foraging toward
   foraging. Here, we use sequential infection of three-spined sticklebacks
   with the cestode Schistocephalus solidus so that parasites have a
   conflict of interest over the direction of host manipulation. With true
   manipulation, the not yet infective parasite should reduce rather than
   enhance risk taking because predation would be fatal for its fitness; if
   host behavior is changed by a side effect, the 2 parasites would add
   their increase of predation risk because both drain energy. Our results
   support the latter hypothesis. In an additional experiment, we tested
   both infected and uninfected fish either starved or satiated. True host
   manipulation should act independently of the fish's hunger status and
   continue when energy drain is balanced through satiation. Starvation and
   satiation affect the risk averseness of infected sticklebacks similarly
   to that of uninfected starved and satiated ones. Increased energy drain

Abstract = {{Many birds have advanced their spring migration and breeding phenology
   in response to climate change, yet some long-distance migrants appear
   constrained in their adjustments. In addition, bird species with long
   generation times and those in higher trophic positions may also be less
   able to track climate-induced shifts in food availability. Migratory
   birds of prey may therefore be particularly vulnerable to climate change
   because: 1) most are long-lived and have relatively low reproductive
   capacity, 2) many feed predominately on insectivorous passerines, and 3)
   several undertake annual migrations totaling tens of thousands of
   kilometers. Using multi-decadal datasets for 14 raptor species observed
   at six sites across the Great Lakes region of North America, we detected
   phenological shifts in spring migration consistent with decadal climatic
   oscillations and global climate change. While the North Atlantic and El
   Nino Southern Oscillations exerted heterogeneous effects on the
   phenology of a few species, arrival dates more generally advanced by
   1.18 d per decade, a pattern consistent with the effects of global
   climate change. After accounting for heterogeneity across observation
   sites, five of the 10 most abundant species advanced the bulk of their
   spring migration phenology. Contrary to expectations, we found that
   long-distance migrants and birds with longer generation times tended to
   make the greatest advancements to their spring migration. Such results
   may indicate that phenotypic plasticity can facilitate climatic
   responses among these long-lived predators.}},

   in sexual signaling within a variety of contexts, however fewer
   experiments have examined individual-level variation in the extent of
   signaling plasticity and the causes of this variation. In this study we
   examined the influence of size and physical condition on the magnitude
   of signaling plasticity using a gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) study
   system. We quantified signaling plasticity by recording male calling
   behavior first in the absence and then in the presence of a sexually
   receptive female. For one call property, call length, we found that both
   weight and condition had a significant influence on the magnitude of
   plasticity. Smaller males, and males in higher condition exhibited the
   greatest degree of plasticity. We discuss several possible explanations
   for this pattern and provide suggestions for future work to examine the
   consequences of this plasticity and the potential interactive effects of
   multiple biotic and abiotic contexts on signaling plasticity. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Predation risk can strongly constrain how individuals use time and
   space. Grouping is known to reduce an individual's time investment in
   costly antipredator behaviours. Whether grouping might similarly provide
   a spatial release from antipredator behaviour and allow individuals to
   use risky habitat more and, thus, improve their access to resources is
   poorly known. We used mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti, to test the
   hypothesis that grouping facilitates the use of high-risk habitat. We
   provided two habitats, one darker, low-risk and one lighter, high-risk,
   and measured the relative time spent in the latter by solitary larvae
   versus larvae in small groups. We tested larvae reared under different
   resource levels, and thus presumed to vary in body condition, because
   condition is known to influence risk taking. We also varied the degree
   of contrast in habitat structure. We predicted that individuals in
   groups should use high-risk habitat more than solitary individuals
   allowing for influences of body condition and contrast in habitat
   structure. Grouping strongly influenced the time spent in the high-risk
   habitat, but, contrary to our expectation, individuals in groups spent
   less time in the high-risk habitat than solitary individuals.
   Furthermore, solitary individuals considerably increased the proportion
   of time spent in the high-risk habitat over time, whereas individuals in
   groups did not. Both solitary individuals and those in groups showed a
   small increase over time in their use of riskier locations within each
   habitat. The differences between solitary individuals and those in
   groups held across all resource and contrast conditions. Grouping may,
   thus, carry a poorly understood cost of constraining habitat use. This
   cost may arise because movement traits important for maintaining group
   cohesion (a result of strong selection on grouping) can act to
   exaggerate an individual preference for low-risk habitat. Further
   research is needed to examine the interplay between grouping, individual
   movement and habitat use traits in environments heterogeneous in risk
   and resources. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In 2012, yoga was practiced by 20 million Americans, of whom
   82\% were women. A recent literature review on prenatal yoga noted a
   reduction in some pregnancy complications (ie, preterm birth, lumbar
   pain, and growth restriction) in those who practiced yoga; to date,
   there is no evidence on fetal response after yoga.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the acute changes in maternal and
   fetal response to prenatal yoga exercises using common standardized
   tests to assess the well-being of the maternal-fetal unit.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single, blinded, randomized controlled
   trial. Uncomplicated pregnancies between 28 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks with a
   nonanomalous singleton fetus of women who did not smoke, use narcotics,
   or have prior experience with yoga were included. A computer-generated
   simple randomization sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio was used to
   randomize participants into the yoga or control group. Women in the yoga
   group participated in a 1-time, 1 hour yoga class with a certified
   instructor who taught a predetermined yoga sequence. In the control
   group, each participant attended a 1-time, 1 hour PowerPoint
   presentation by an obstetrician on American Congress of Obstetricians
   and Gynecologists recommendations for exercise, nutrition, and obesity
   in pregnancy. All participants underwent pre- and postintervention
   testing, which consisted of umbilical and uterine artery Doppler
   ultrasound, nonstress testing, a biophysical profile, maternal blood
   pressure, and maternal heart rate. A board-certified maternal-fetal
   medicine specialist, at a different tertiary center, interpreted all
   nonstress tests and biophysical profile data and was blinded to group
   assignment and pre- or post-intervention testing. The primary outcome
   was a change in umbilical artery Doppler systolic to diastolic ratio.
   Sample size calculations indicated 19 women per group would be
   sufficient to detect this difference in Doppler indices (alpha, 0.05;
   power, 80\%). Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of
   variance, a chi(2), and a Fisher exact test. A value of P<.05 was
   considered significant.
   RESULTS: Of the 52 women randomized, 46 (88\%) completed the study.
   There was no clinically significant change in umbilical artery systolic
   to diastolic ratio (P=.34), pulsatility index (P=.53), or resistance
   index (P=.66) between the 2 groups before and after the intervention.
   Fetal and maternal heart rate, maternal blood pressure, and uterine
   artery Dopplers remained unchanged over time. When umbilical artery
   indices were individually compared with gestational age references,
   there was no difference between those who improved or worsened between
   the groups.
   CONCLUSION: There was no significant change in fetal blood flow acutely
   after performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy. Yoga can be
   recommended for low-risk women to begin during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{The transition between shallow and mesophotic coral reef communities in
   the tropics is characterized by a significant gradient in abiotic and
   biotic conditions that could result in potential trade-offs in energy
   allocation. The mesophotic reefs in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands
   have a rich sponge fauna with significantly greater percent cover of
   sponges than in their respective shallow reef communities, but
   relatively low numbers of spongivores. Plakortis angulospiculatus, a
   common sponge species that spans the depth gradient from shallow to
   mesophotic reefs in the Caribbean, regenerates faster following
   predation and invests more energy in protein synthesis at mesophotic
   depths compared to shallow reef conspecifics. However, since P.
   angulospiculatus from mesophotic reefs typically contain lower
   concentrations of chemical feeding deterrents, they are not able to
   defend new tissue from predation as efficiently as conspecifics from
   shallow reefs. Nonetheless, following exposure to predators on shallow
   reefs, transplanted P. angulospiculatus from mesophotic depths developed
   chemical deterrence to predatory fishes. A survey of bioactive extracts
   indicated that a specific defensive metabolite, plakortide F, varied in
   concentration with depth, producing altered deterrence between shallow
   and mesophotic reef P. angulospiculatus. Different selective pressures
   in shallow and mesophotic habitats have resulted in phenotypic
   plasticity within this sponge species that is manifested in variable
   chemical defense and tissue regeneration at wound sites.}},

Abstract = {{Current models indicate that an organism's sensitivity to risk may be
   heavily influenced by the trade-off between current and future
   reproduction. Individuals that have fewer future reproductive
   opportunities are expected to show more risky behavior as they have less
   to lose if captured by a predator (the asset protection principle). In
   this study, we examined the effects of age and physical condition on
   risk taking behavior during sexual signaling in the gray treefrog (Hyla
   versicolor) to test the prediction that older and poor condition males
   will take greater risks than their younger or higher-condition
   counterparts. In accordance with these predictions, we found that males
   in low physical condition resumed signaling activity more rapidly
   following a simulated predator attack than their higher-condition
   counterparts, although this effect was only apparent in one of two study
   years. Further, males that resumed calling early did not offset their
   risk of detection by predators via reduced calling effort. Contrary to
   our predictions, we did not find age to be a significant predictor of
   risk taking in male signaling behavior. We conclude with a discussion of
   possible explanations for the discrepancy observed between years and
   highlight the potential reproductive consequences of variation in risk

Abstract = {{Within the broad discourses of environmental change, sustainability
   science, and anthropogenic Earth-surface systems, a focused body of work
   involves the coupled economic and physical dynamics of developed
   shorelines. Rapid rates of change in coastal environments, from wetlands
   and deltas to inlets and dune systems, help researchers recognize,
   observe, and investigate coupling in natural (non-human) morphodynamics
   and biomorphodynamics. This same intrinsic quality of fast-paced change
   also makes developed coastal zones exemplars of observable coupling
   between physical processes and human activities. In many coastal
   communities, beach erosion is a natural hazard with economic costs that
   coastal management counters through a variety of mitigation strategies,
   including beach replenishment, groynes, revetments, and seawalls. As
   cycles of erosion and mitigation iterate, coastline change and
   economically driven interventions become mutually linked. Emergent
   dynamics of two-way economic-physical coupling is a recent research
   discovery. Having established a strong theoretical basis, research into
   coupled human-coastal systems has passed its early proof-of-concept
   phase. This paper frames three major challenges that need resolving in
   order to advance theoretical and empirical treatments of human-coastal
   systems: (1) codifying salient individual and social behaviors of
   decision-making in ways that capture societal actions across a range of
   scales (thus engaging economics, social science, and policy
   disciplines); (2) quantifying anthropogenic effects on alongshore and
   cross-shore sediment pathways and long-term landscape evolution in
   coastal zones through time, including direct measurement of cumulative
   changes to sediment cells resulting from coastal development and
   management practices (e.g., construction of buildings and artificial
   dunes, bulldozer removal of overwash after major storms); and (3)
   reciprocal knowledge and data exchange between researchers in coastal
   morphodynamics and practitioners of coastal management. Future research
   into human-coastal systems can benefit from decades of interdisciplinary
   work on the complex dynamics of common-pool resources, from
   computational efficiency and new techniques in numerical modeling, and
   from the growing catalog of high-resolution geospatial data for natural
   and developed coastlines around the world. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{The alcohol harm paradox: using a national survey to explore how alcohol
   may disproportionately impact health in deprived individuals}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Internationally, studies show that similar levels of alcohol
   consumption in deprived communities (vs. more affluent) result in higher
   levels of alcohol-related ill health. Hypotheses to explain this alcohol
   harm paradox include deprived drinkers: suffering greater combined
   health challenges (e.g. smoking, obesity) which exacerbate effects of
   alcohol harms; exhibiting more harmful consumption patterns (e.g.
   bingeing); having a history of more harmful consumption; and
   disproportionately under-reporting consumption. We use a bespoke
   national survey to assess each of these hypotheses.
   Methods: A national telephone survey designed to test this alcohol harm
   paradox was undertaken (May 2013 to April 2014) with English adults (n =
   6015). Deprivation was assigned by area of residence. Questions examined
   factors including: current and historic drinking patterns; combined
   health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass); and
   under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special
   occasion drinking). For each factor, analyses examined differences
   between deprived and more affluent individuals controlled for total
   alcohol consumption.
   Results: Independent of total consumption, deprived drinkers were more
   likely to smoke, be overweight and report poor diet and exercise.
   Consequently, deprived increased risk drinkers (male >168-400 g, female
   >112-280 g alcohol/week) were >10 times more likely than non-deprived
   counterparts to drink in a behavioural syndrome combining smoking,
   excess weight and poor diet/exercise. Differences by deprivation were
   significant but less marked in higher risk drinkers (male >400 g, female
   >280 g alcohol/week). Current binge drinking was associated with
   deprivation independently of total consumption and a history of bingeing
   was also associated with deprivation in lower and increased risk
   drinkers.
   Conclusions: Deprived increased/higher drinkers are more likely than
   affluent counterparts to consume alcohol as part of a suite of health
   challenging behaviours including smoking, excess weight and poor
   diet/exercise. Together these can have multiplicative effects on risks
   of wholly (e.g. alcoholic liver disease) and partly (e.g. cancers)
   alcohol-related conditions. More binge drinking in deprived individuals
   will also increase risks of injury and heart disease despite total
   alcohol consumption not differing from affluent counterparts. Public
   health messages on how smoking, poor diet/exercise and bingeing escalate
   health risks associated with alcohol are needed, especially in deprived
   communities, as their absence will contribute to health inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{Personality disorders are common, and the core problems of interpersonal
   dysfunction and social disturbance are difficult to treat. One area
   gaining international attention is the impact that diet and nutrients
   can have on psychiatric/psychological symptoms. There are no empirical
   studies studying the specific relationship between nutrition and
   personality disorders. A systematic search revealed longitudinal studies
   following malnourished children, either during pregnancy or in early
   life that reported malnourishment is a risk factor that can express as
   maladaptive behaviours later in life. Other studies show associations
   between nutrient intake and personality styles. A small body of
   literature reveals a potential benefit of consuming nutrients
   therapeutically in order to address behaviours often associated with
   personality disorders. If we consider the broad patterns of behaviour
   that typify personality disorders, such as cognition, affectivity,
   interpersonal functioning and impulse control, there is a research
   rationale for studying the role that nutrition could play in protecting
   against the development of these problems as well as possibly modifying
   them. Whether it is too late to intervene with nutrition once the
   pathological behaviours are entrenched is unknown. Given the dearth of
   good evidence-based treatments currently available for people with
   personality disorders, it is an area worth investing in. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Many organisms must move among habitats to fulfill life history
   requirements. Fish movements have been widely studied and tend to be
   either fine-scale (i.e., routine) and governed by factors such as food
   availability and cover, or broad-scale and associated with spawning
   migrations. However, movements of invasive fishes in non-native
   ecosystems are comparatively poorly understood despite the often
   critical importance of fish movement and dispersal for invasion success.
   We examined invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) movements
   using acoustic telemetry to monitor the timing, distance, and direction
   of fish movements and assessed movements in relation to seasonal,
   annual, environmental, and individual factors in the Wabash River
   (Indiana, USA), a largely unregulated Midwestern river. Silver Carp
   exhibited highly variable movements that could be rapid and large in
   magnitude; however, tagged individuals remained stationary most of the
   time. Despite high variability, several trends emerged, indicating the
   importance of backwater habitats, avoidance of small tributaries, and
   tendencies of tagged fish to exhibit directed spring and fall
   broad-scale movements. Summer movements were smaller in magnitude,
   characterized by lower movement rates, and evenly split between upstream
   and downstream directions, although tagged Silver Carp moved more
   frequently during summer months. Our results indicate that specific
   seasons (i.e., spring and early fall) and locations (i.e., backwaters)
   are likely targets for Silver Carp control in the Wabash River and
   should also be useful targets for early detection and control in other
   largely unconstrained rivers over a broad geographic range (e.g., Great
   Lakes tributaries and upper Mississippi River mainstem and tributaries).}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera:
   Lymantriidae), a generalist species, frequently encounter spatial and
   temporal variations in diet quality. Such variation favoured the
   evolution of high behavioural and physiological plasticity which,
   depending on forest stand composition, enables more or less successful
   exploitation of the environment. Even in mixed oak stands, a suitable
   habitat, interspecific and intraspecific host quality variation may
   provoke significant variation in gypsy moth performance and,
   consequently, defoliation severity. To elucidate the insufficiently
   explored relationship between gypsy moth and oaks (Fagaceae), we carried
   out reciprocal switches between Turkey oaks (Quercus cerris L.) and less
   nutritious Hungarian oaks (Quercus frainetto Ten.) (TH and HT groups),
   under controlled laboratory conditions, and compared larval performance
   between the switched larvae and larvae continuously fed on either Turkey
   oak (TT) or Hungarian oak (HH). We found that larval traits were most
   strongly affected by among-tree variation in oak quality and identity of
   the host consumed during the fourth instar. Switching from Turkey to
   Hungarian oak (TH) led to a longer period of feeding, decrease of mass
   gain, growth, and consumption rate, lower efficiency of food use and
   nutrient conversion, and increase of protease and amylase activities.
   Larvae exposed to the reverse switch (HT) attained values of these
   traits characteristic for TT larvae. It appeared that the lower growth
   in the TH group than in the TT group was caused by both behavioural
   (consumption, pre-ingestive) and metabolic (post-digestive) effects from
   consuming oaks. Multivariate analyses of growth, consumption, and
   efficiency of food use revealed that early diet experience influenced
   the sensitivity of themost examined traits to less suitableHungarian
   oaks, suggesting the development of behavioural and physiological
   adjustments. Our results indicate that lower risks of defoliation by
   gypsy mothmight be expected inmixed stands with a higher proportion of
   Hungarian oak.}},

Abstract = {{Background Many young children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) do
   not consume a healthful diet; exactly why this occurs despite T1DM
   education remains poorly understood.
   Objective This study describes parents' perceptions of healthful eating
   for T1DM in young children and identifies factors related to parents'
   dietary management.
   Design A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was performed. Parents
   completed a questionnaire, 3-day weighed diet record, and a
   semi-structured interview regarding their perceptions of healthful
   eating for T1DM and their dietary management practices.
   Participants/setting Twenty-three families, recruited from a pediatric
   diabetes clinic in the midwestern United States between February 2012
   and April 2013, participated. Eligible families had a child with T1DM
   who was 1 to 6 years old, at least 6 months from diagnosis, and was
   following an intensive insulin regimen.
   Statistical analyses performed Mean scores and percentages were
   calculated from the diet diaries and parent questionnaires, and parents'
   interviews were coded to identify common themes.
   Results Results showed that while parents may believe they know what
   constitutes a healthful diet for T1DM, they do not always feed their
   child a healthful diet. Parent-identified barriers to healthful eating
   included limited time to prepare homemade meals, perceived higher costs
   of healthier foods, the influence of peers on children's food
   preferences, and picky eating. Parents also discussed a desire not to
   limit their child's diet or make their child ``feel different,{''} which
   many parents said often led them to give into their child's requests for
   less healthful food options.
   Conclusions Parents of young children with T1DM identified several
   barriers to healthful eating that are common for all parents, such as
   time constraints, expense, and child food preferences. However, unique
   themes emerged, including parents' desire not to limit their child's
   diet or make their child ``feel different.{''} Nutrition components of
   T1DM education should include psychological and behavioral strategies to
   help parents manage these unique concerns.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{298}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Daily activity patterns in mammals depend on food availability,
   reproductive stage, habitat selection, intraspecific interactions and
   predation risk, among other factors. Some mammals exhibit behavioral
   plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to
   environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red
   fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized
   environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human
   interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock).
   We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of
   the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera
   traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European
   wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g.
   distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and
   habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and
   nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox
   activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with
   prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when
   rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms
   seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is
   high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher
   levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high
   predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study
   shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are
   determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex
   behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies
   should consider different factors simultaneously for a better
   understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fully understand factors that affect animals during their
   annual cycle, it is important to measure physiological and behavioral
   responses to environmental conditions in multiple seasons. We tested the
   hypothesis that corticosterone levels (CORT) are affected by spatial and
   temporal variations in marine environmental conditions by measuring
   levels in the feathers (grown outside of the breeding season) and blood
   (collected during the breeding season) of an abundant North Pacific
   seabird, the rhinoceros anklet Cerorhinca monocerata. Birds involved in
   our study bred on three widely dispersed colonies in three years in
   which oceanographic conditions differed markedly. Combined nitrogen
   (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope values in blood
   differed among colonies, while values in feathers did not, suggesting
   that individuals from the three colonies were segregated during the
   breeding season (as expected from foraging range around breeding
   colonies), but not during the nonbreeding period (as expected from
   genetic homogeneity). CORT showed the same pattern of dichotomy; of
   particular note, but contrary to our a priori prediction, blood CORT
   levels were higher in anklets that bred on a colony in which early
   chlorophyll-a bloom in local waters suggested good feeding conditions,
   than in anklets that bred on a colony with later local chlorophyll a
   bloom. Also contrary to prediction, feather CORT was higher in a year
   featuring favorable, cold-water La Nina conditions than in a year of
   unfavorable, warm-water El Nino conditions; values in a third, moderate
   year were intermediate. We conclude that CORT levels are affected by
   spatiotemporal variation in marine environmental conditions, but
   relationships appear to depend heavily on context and thus require
   careful interpretation and more study.}},

Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{The effects of social and ecological stressors on female reproductive
   success vary among species and, in mammals, previous reviews have
   identified no clear patterns. However, few studies have simultaneously
   examined the relation between social rank and stressors and the
   relationships among rank, stressors and reproductive success. We used a
   long-term data set to study free-living facultatively social
   yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, to isolate the
   relationship between female social dominance rank and faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels (our measure of basal stress) in
   adult females. In addition, we examined whether rank and FGM levels were
   associated with reproductive success by quantifying the probability of
   an individual successfully weaning a litter and, for those who did,
   litter size. Highranking females had lower FGM levels and larger
   litters. However, females with the highest FGM levels were significantly
   more likely to wean a litter. Importantly, body condition (as measured
   by previous year's mass) was also positively associated with breeding
   and with weaning larger litters. Thus, although low-ranking females
   probably experienced more social stressors than high-ranking females and
   although adult females often delayed their first reproduction until they
   were of a sufficient mass, our results suggest that elevated baseline
   FGM levels failed to mediate reproductive suppression. Perhaps, in
   species like marmots that have only a single chance per year to
   reproduce, reproductive suppression should be rare. These results
   highlight the importance of social status, body condition and predator
   abundance on determining reproductive success in highly seasonal
   breeders. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The maternal environment influences a broad range of phenotypic outcomes
   for offspring, with anxiety like behavior being particularly susceptible
   to maternal environmental perturbations. Much less is known regarding
   paternal environmental influences. To investigate this, adult male rats
   were exposed to 25\% calorie restriction (CR) or glucocorticoid
   elevation (CORT; 200 mu g/ml of corticosterone in drinking water) for 6
   weeks prior to breeding. Elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF),
   predator odor (cat urine), and acoustic startle/pre-pulse inhibition
   (AS/PPI) were characterised in the adult male offspring. Plasma
   concentrations of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRF),
   adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and serum lepin were characterised
   in both sires and offspring. Maternal care received by litters was
   additionally observed. Expectedly, CR and CORT treatment attenuated
   weight gain, whilst only CR induced anxiolytic behavior in the EPM. The
   adult offspring sired by CR males also demonstrated a reduction in
   weight gain, food intake and serum leptin levels when compared to
   controls. Moreover, CR offspring demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile
   in the EPM and OF, enhanced habituation to the AS pulse, reduced PPI,
   but no alteration to predator odor induced defensiveness compared to
   control. CORT offspring failed to demonstrate any behavioral differences
   from controls, however, exhibited a trend towards reduced ACTH and
   leptin concentration. Collectively, the results indicate that a
   reduction in calories in males prior to conception can affect the
   behavior of adult offspring. The phenotypic transmission of CR
   experiences from fathers to the progeny could potentially be mediated
   epigenetically. The role of glucocorticoid elevation and maternal care
   are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are
   well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been
   considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager
   population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal
   variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of
   initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality
   and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity.
   Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly.
   Residual lifespan increased by 57 \% when colonies were penned for 20
   days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory.
   Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into
   the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation
   did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population
   size declined when mortality exceeded 4 \% per day. Experimental
   increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to
   foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These
   results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers
   that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the
   well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained
   not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing
   at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker
   depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks,
   opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by
   inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger
   workers.}},

Abstract = {{The functional response describes the relationship between feeding rate

   Consuming Beans}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Bean consumption can reduce chronic disease risk and improve nutrition
   status. Consumer knowledge of bean health benefits could lead to
   increased intakes. Low-income women have poorer health and nutrition,
   but their level of knowledge about bean health benefits is unknown.
   Beans are a familiar food of reasonable cost in most settings and are
   cultural staples for Hispanics and other ethnicities. Study objectives
   were to assess awareness of bean health benefits among low-income women,
   and to evaluate any differences by acculturation status for Hispanic
   women in the Southwestern United States.
   Methods
   A convenience sample of 406 primarily Mexican-origin (70\%) low-income
   women completed a survey on knowledge of bean health benefits and
   general food behaviors. Principal components analysis of responses
   identified two summary scale constructs representing ``bean health
   benefits{''} and ``food behaviors.{''} Acculturation level was the main
   independent variable in chi-square or ANOVA.
   Results
   survey completion rate was 86\% (406/471). Most women agreed or strongly
   agreed that beans improved nutrition (65\%) and were satiating (62\%).
   Over 50\% answered `neutral' to statements that beans could lower LDL
   cholesterol (52\%), control blood glucose (56\%) or reduce cancer risk
   (56\%), indicating indifference or possible lack of knowledge about bean
   health benefits. There were significant differences by acculturation for
   beliefs that beans aid weight loss and intestinal health. Scores on the
   bean health benefits scale, but not the food behavior scale, also
   differed by acculturation.
   Conclusions
   Limited resource women have a favorable view of the nutrition value of
   beans, but the majority did not agree or disagreed with statements about
   bean health benefits. Greater efforts to educate low-income women about
   bean health benefits may increase consumption and improve nutrition.}},

   perturbation of the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy, induced by
   administration of non-absorbable antibiotics to pregnant dams,

   length polymorphism analyses of fecal bacterial composition showed that
   the relative abundance of the bacterial order Lactobacillales was lower

   control offspring (42.1 +/- 6.2\%) at P24, while the relative abundance
   of the bacterial family Clostridium subcluster XIVa was higher in
   offspring born from antibiotic-treated dams (34.2 +/- 5.0\%) than in
   control offspring (16.4 +/- 3.3\%). Offspring born from
   antibiotic-treated dams exhibited low locomotor activity in both
   familiar and novel environments, and preferred to explore in the
   peripheral area of an unfamiliar field at postnatal week 4. At postnatal
   weeks 7-8, no difference was observed in the level of locomotor activity

   while the tendency for the offspring from antibiotic-treated dams to be
   less engaged in exploring the inside area was still observed. The
   behavioral phenotypes of the offspring from antibiotic-treated dams at
   postnatal week 4 could be rescued to a considerable extent through
   fostering of these offspring by normal dams from postnatal day 1.
   Although the detailed underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated,

   support autonomy in children}},
Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: In pediatric hemophilia, caregivers are facing unique
   challenges to adherence and self-care in children and adolescents with
   hemophilia. Hemophilia treatment requires adequate prophylaxis and
   on-demand treatment, as well as a clear behavioral strategy to limit
   risk-taking in terms of physical exercise and diet. Medication adherence
   rates of hemophilia patients have been reported to decrease during late
   childhood and adolescence. In the developing child, moving safely from
   parent-care to self-care is one of the greatest challenges of
   integrative care within this domain. There is a clear need for
   initiatives designed to increase an individual's motivation for
   treatment and self-care activities.
   Discussion: Among motivational approaches, the self-determination
   perspective offers a useful framework to explain how the transition to
   self-care can be facilitated. We discuss how motivation regarding
   hemophilia treatment may be increased through parental autonomy support
   and we offer examples of applied communication techniques to facilitate
   autonomy-supportive caregiving. Although it has not yet been tested in
   the context of hemophilia, these communication techniques could
   potentially help caregivers promote adherence and self-care in children.
   Summary: Confronted by unique challenges to adherence and self-care,
   caregivers of children with hemophilia should move from an exclusive
   focus on illness-management education to an integrative strategy,
   including motivation-enhancing communication. The self-determination
   perspective provides important proximal objectives (e.g. autonomy
   support) to maintain optimal adherence in adolescents as they move from
   parent-care to self-care. Future research initiatives should address the
   practice of these communication techniques and evaluate them in the
   context of hemophilia.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing recognition that the gut microbiota plays a central role

   HA7 diet (OS-HA7) for 6 week and monitored for weight, behavior and
   fecal microbiota composition. Animals fed an HA7 diet displayed
   comparable weight gain over the feeding period to that recorded for
   NCS-fed animals while OS-HA7 displayed a lower weight gain as compared
   to either NCS or HA7 animals (ANOVA p = 0.0001; NCS:HA7 p = 0.244;
   HA7:OS-HA7 p<0.0001; NCS:OS-HA7 p<0.0001). Analysis of fecal microbiota
   using 16s rRNA gene taxonomic profiling revealed that each diet
   corresponded with a unique gut microbiota. The distribution of taxonomic
   classes was dynamic over the 6 week feeding period for each of the
   diets. At the end of the feeding periods, the distribution of taxa
   included statistically significant increases in members of the phylum
   Proteobacteria in OSHA7NCS:OS-HA7 p = 1.000; HA7:OS-HA7 p = 0.0001) as
   well as entries in the open arm (ANOVA p = 0.039; NCS:HA7 p = 0.041;
   HA7:OS-HA7 p = 0.221; NCS:OS-HA7 p = 1.000). Open-field behavior, a
   measure of general locomotion and exploration, revealed statistically
   significant differences between groups in locomotion as a measure of
   transitions across quadrant boundaries. Additionally, the open-field
   assay revealed decreased exploration as well as decreased rearing in HA7
   and OS-HA7 fed mice demonstrating a consistent pattern of increased
   anxiety-like behavior among these groups. Critically, behavior was not
   correlated with weight. These results indicate that diets based on
   resistant starch can be utilized to produce quantifiable changes in the
   gut microbiota and should be useful to ``dial-in{''} a specific
   microbiome that is unique to a particular starch composition. However,
   undesirable effects can also be associated with resistant starch,
   including lack of weight gain and increased anxiety-like behaviors.
   These observations warrant careful consideration when developing diets
   rich in resistant starch in humans and animal models. fed mice, while
   the Verrucomicrobia increased in HA7 fed mice over that of mice fed
   OS-HA7. At the class level, members of the class Bacilli decreased in
   the OS-HA7 fed group, and Actinobacteria, which includes the genus
   Bifidobacteria, was enriched in the HA7 fed group compared to the
   control diet. Behavioral analysis revealed that animals demonstrated
   profound anxiety-like behavior as observed by performance on the
   elevated-plus maze with time spent by the mice in the open arm (ANOVA p

Abstract = {{The pig is an excellent model to study human eating behaviour and its
   neurobiological determinants. The pig is omnivorous and has a digestive
   system that closely resembles that of humans. Furthermore, the
   establishment of eating behaviour and food preferences in the pig
   follows the same rules and influences as those identified in humans. It
   is thus possible to observe similar behavioural responses related to
   food in both species, like for instance spontaneous attractions for
   certain basic flavours, or the development of preferences that have been
   conditioned or learned through individual experiences or signals
   perceived in the environment or transmitted by the mother. In addition,
   the brain of pigs and humans shares common developmental, anatomical and
   functional features, thus enabling precise explorations via the use of
   modern techniques of brain functional imaging. The neurobiological
   mechanisms underlying the development of food preferences or aversions
   have been described in the pig model, as well as some neurocognitive
   abnormalities associated with obesity or the chronic consumption of
   deleterious diets. Therefore, the pig can be used as a pertinent model
   to explore new therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain
   stimulation, to fight against obesity and eating disorders. The pig
   model thus offers many opportunities for exploratory and preclinical
   biomedical research in the field of food and nutritional neurosciences.}},

Abstract = {{Rather diverse than formal education, the informal education does not
   fit generally into the templates proposed by the actual compulsory
   curricula, but proposes various activities open not just to pupils and

   education tries to enrich the formal and non-formal education, without
   the necessity concerning the recognition of the learning activities
   supported by a degree or by a diploma. Usually, the informal education
   takes into consideration the pedagogical influences on each individual

   particular living environment social, cultural, political, economic,

Title = {{Food neophobia and ethnic food consumption intention An extension of the
   theory of planned behaviour}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2781-2797}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to serve as groundwork to
   investigate the determinants of ethnic food consumption intention in the
   context of developing markets. Using the theory of planned behaviour as
   the underlying basis, it is aimed to explain the effect of attitude,
   subjective norm and perceived behaviour control on consumption intention
   towards Dayak food. Since Dayak food is relatively unfamiliar compared
   to conventional food in Malaysia, food neophobia is incorporated into
   the model so as to assess its moderation effect on every postulated
   relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach via
   self-administered questionnaire was adopted. In all, 300 copies of the
   questionnaire were distributed to non-Dayak Malaysians, and 211 usable
   copies were subsequently collected, suggesting that non-response bias
   was not a major issue. A post hoc Harman single-factor analysis was also
   performed to ensure the variance in the data was not explained by one
   single factor, thus addressing the common method bias. Structural
   equation modelling using partial least squares approach was then
   utilized to assess the relationships of variables under investigation
   and the moderation effect of food neophobia.
   Findings - After ensuring the data have acceptable reliability and
   validity, structural model assessment was performed to test the
   hypotheses. The findings show that attitude, subjective norm and
   perceived behavioural control all have positive effect on consumption
   intention of non-Dayak Malaysians towards Dayak food. However, food
   neophobia is only found to have a moderation effect on the relationship
   between subjective norm and consumption intention.
   Research limitations/implications - First, the sample is largely
   consisted of college and university students in Malaysia who are
   believed to be more daring to try new things, including new food. Second
   and more importantly, the dearth of literature and empirical studies on
   Dayak food and ethnic food in Malaysia might have actually pointed to
   the limitation in using only quantitative questionnaire in the study. As
   salient beliefs are the antecedents in the theory of planned behaviour,
   knowing consumers' specific beliefs about Dayak food would have provided
   a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of consumption intention
   and the moderating effect of food neophobia.
   Practical implications - The moderation effect of food neophobia on the
   relationship between subjective norm and consumption intention towards
   Dayak food implies the importance of recommendations and favourable
   word-of-mouth from the significant ones, such as family members and
   peers, to make people willing to try and consume it. This corresponds to
   earlier findings pertaining to the collectivistic culture in Malaysia.
   Unlike countries with individualistic cultures, Malaysians tend to
   conform to the consumption choices of significant others. This implies
   that those whom they hold in high regard, are able to influence them
   both positively and negatively through their advice or opinions.
   Originality/value - The present study has not only extended the use of
   theory of planned behaviour in the context of Dayak food consumption
   intention in a developing country, but it has also deepened the theory
   by incorporating food neophobia as the moderator to provide additional
   theoretical explanation to ethnic food consumption intention. Given the
   wealth of Asian culture, and its significant role in the global
   marketplace, the understanding of ethnic food consumption intention of
   the local and foreign consumers using the extended theory of planned
   behaviour would contribute knowledge not only to consumer behaviour, but
   also to food and service industry and tourism.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{45-46}},
Pages = {{2829-2837}},
Abstract = {{Individual nutritional status may increase marginal foraging costs and
   potentially drive animal foraging strategies. Here, we investigated how
   it might affect foraging strategies of the shelter-building spider
   Hingstepeira folisecens (Hingston 1932) (Araneidae). This spider can
   catch prey using two strategies with different relative costs: `pulling'
   (higher energy expenditure) and `pursuing' (lower energy expenditure).
   We conducted experiments by offering prey at a fixed distance from the
   shelter entrance to investigate if spiders with lower nutritional status
   would exhibit riskier but less costly foraging behaviours more
   frequently than spiders with better status. The nutritional status did
   not affect the foraging behaviours adopted by H. folisecens.
   Additionally, the frequency of both foraging behaviours was similar.
   Therefore, our results did not provide any evidence that individual
   nutritional status is a factor driving the selection of foraging
   behaviours in H. folisecens. We suggest that the malnourished spiders
   should adopt additional strategies to compensate for the costs of
   pulling behaviour, especially when prey is far from the shelter.
   Furthermore, it is possible that other factors, like relative prey size
   in relation to web size, can help us to understand the threshold that
   determines when such individuals must adopt one of two possible
   behaviours.}},

Journal = {{OBESITY FACTS}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The global obesity epidemic continues, new approaches are
   needed to understand the causes. We analyzed data from an evolutionary
   perspective, stressing developmental plasticity.
   Methods: We present diachronical height, weight, and BMI data for
   702,902 Swiss male conscripts aged 18-20 years, a representative,
   standardized and unchanged data source.
   Results: From 1875 to 1879, the height distribution was slightly
   left-skewed; 12.1\% of the conscripts were underweight, overweight and
   obesity were rare. The BMI-to-height relationship was positive but not
   linear, and very short conscripts were particularly slim. Since the
   1870s, Swiss conscripts became taller, a trend that markedly slowed in
   the 1990s. In contrast, weight increased in two distinct steps at the
   end of the 1980s and again after 2002. Since 2010, BMI did not increase
   but stabilized at a high level.
   Conclusions: The body of young men adapted differently to varying living
   conditions over time: First, less investment in height and weight under
   conditions of undernutrition and food uncertainty; second, more
   investment in height under more stable nutritional conditions; third,
   development of obesity during conditions of plateaued height growth,
   overnutrition, and decreasing physical activity. This example
   contributes to the evaluation of hypotheses on human developmental

Abstract = {{The long-term weight management of obesity remains a very difficult
   task, associated with a high risk of failure and weight regain. However,
   many people report that they have successfully managed weight loss
   maintenance in the long term. Several factors have been associated with
   better weight loss maintenance in long-term observational and randomized
   studies. A few pertain to the behavioral area (eg, high levels of
   physical activity, eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet; frequent
   self-monitoring of weight), a few to the cognitive component (eg,
   reduced disinhibition, satisfaction with results achieved, confidence in
   being able to lose weight without professional help), and a few to
   personality traits (eg, low novelty seeking) and patient-therapist
   interaction. Trials based on the most recent protocols of lifestyle
   modification, with a prolonged extended treatment after the weight loss
   phase, have also shown promising long-term weight loss results. These
   data should stimulate the adoption of a lifestyle modification-based
   approach for the management of obesity, featuring a nonphysician
   lifestyle counselor (also called ``lifestyle trainer{''} or ``healthy
   lifestyle practitioner{''}) as a pivotal component of the
   multidisciplinary team. The obesity physicians maintain a primary role

   decision for drug treatment or bariatric surgery, as possible more
   intensive, add-on interventions to lifestyle treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves complex cognitive abilities,
   including risky decision-making; the modulation of this brain area is
   shown to alter the way people take risks. Yet, neuromodulation of the
   PFC in relation to risk-taking behavior remains relatively less
   well-studied. Moreover, the psychological variables that influence such
   neuromodulation remain poorly understood. To address these issues, 16
   participants took part in 3 experimental sessions on separate days. They
   received: (i) left anodal-right cathodal transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS); (ii) left cathodal-right anodal stimulation; or
   (iii) sham stimulation while they completed two risk-taking tasks. They
   also measured on several cognitive-affective abilities and personality
   traits. It was revealed that left cathodal-right anodal stimulation led
   to significantly reduced risk-taking under a context of haste. The
   reduction of risk-taking (relative to sham) correlated with state and
   trait impulsivity, such that the effect was larger in more impulsive
   individuals. For these individuals, the tDCS effect size was considered
   to be large (generalized partial eta(2) >.17). The effect of
   prefrontal-neuromodulation in reducing risk-taking was influenced by
   baseline impulsivity, reflecting a state-dependent effect of
   neuromodulation on the PFC. The results of this study carry important
   insights into the use of neuromodulation to alter higher cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral

   temperature and food intake independently or interactively affected the

   behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely
   more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant
   temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred
   thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed
   individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food
   intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we
   demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on
   behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently
   affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these
   factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e.,
   multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert
   multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of
   individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food

Abstract = {{Global chaotic analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been

   healthy men aged between 18 and 35 years old. Volunteers were instructed
   not to drink alcohol, caffeine or other autonomic nervous system (ANS)
   stimulants for 24 hours before the evaluation. Volunteers performed
   physical exercise on treadmill with intensity of 6.0 km/hour + 1\% slope
   in the first five minutes for physically ``warming up{''}. This was then
   followed by 25 minutes with intensity equivalent to 60\% of V-max, with
   the same slope according to the Conconi threshold. HRV was analyzed in
   the following periods: (a) control protocol; the 10-minute periods
   before the performance of the exercise and (b) the 10-minute periods
   after the performance of the exercise. Both periods of exercise were
   analyzed by the chaotic global techniques. The number of RR-intervals

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the factors affecting
   intentions to purchase food through the internet. Based on the available
   literature - more specifically, on Ajzen's (1985) theory of planned
   behaviour and Grunert and Ramus' model (2004) - this study proposes and
   tests a model of planned food purchases via the internet.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study was conducted among
   403 respondents. Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling.
   Findings - The main results demonstrated that attitude and perceived
   difficulty are the antecedents of purchase intentions. Perceived risk
   had a negative relationship with attitude. With respect to lifestyle,
   novelty was positively related to attitude, and freshness was negatively
   related. In addition, novelty had only an indirect effect on intention,
   which was mediated by attitude. A wired lifestyle had a positive
   relationship with attitude, and a negative relationship with perceived
   difficulty.
   Originality/value - This study operationalizes and improves Grunert and
   Ramus' (2004) model of intention to buy food over the internet, by
   developing, testing and presenting a more comprehensive model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{16-26}},

Abstract = {{Binary choice experiments under natural solar radiation were used to
   test short-term behavioral responses of freshwater calanoid copepods to
   ultraviolet radiation (UV). Responses of the nine species from 15
   populations spanning North and South America included both UV attraction
   and UV avoidance, and varied among habitats, species and populations.
   Copepods from more transparent lakes were more attracted to UV than
   those from less transparent lakes. When individuals were pre-exposed in
   the laboratory to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the
   presence and absence of UV, those pre-exposed to UV spent more time in
   the high UV environment than those exposed to PAR alone. However, these
   differences disappeared after 150 min, suggesting that the responses
   were short term and mediated in part by ambient UV conditions. Copepods
   represent a large proportion of the biomass of zooplankton in many
   aquatic ecosystems, and their ability to detect and respond behaviorally
   to UV may enable them to use this ubiquitous environmental cue to
   regulate their water column position. The use of UV as a habitat
   selection cue may permit copepods to exploit optimal food environments
   or limit overlap with less UV-tolerant competitors, predators or
   parasites, while minimizing damage resulting from longer term UV

Journal = {{AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Abstract = {{Early developmental conditions can have a strong influence on the life
   history. Fire salamanders represent an interesting system due to their
   biphasic life cycle consisting of an aquatic larval stage and a
   subsequent terrestrial stage. The environment experienced as larvae
   affects growth, age at metamorphosis and behaviour. In particular, diet
   restrictions can cause developmental stress. However, the impact of such
   developmental stress on the growth and behaviour in a long-lived
   amphibian are not yet well studied. We manipulated the early diet of
   sibling pairs of fire salamander larvae. One sibling was raised under
   food-restriction and the other was raised under conditions of abundant
   food. We report long-term effects on growth and exploratory behaviour;
   exploratory behaviour was tested in two sessions, first as young
   juveniles and later as sub-adults. We found that food-restricted
   conditions during early development affected exploratory behaviour.
   Early deficits in body mass and body size were compensated later in
   life, by approximately 18 months of age. When morphological differences
   were compensated, the initial differences in exploratory behaviour also
   disappeared. Thus, compensation not only led to an alignment of body
   parameters but was also accompanied by an adjustment in exploratory
   behaviour. No cost of compensation was detected, but future research
   will need to verify whether the potential costs of compensation are
   negligible in slow-growing salamanders or whether they are shifted to
   later life stages. Our study provides novel insights into the life
   history of fire salamanders and reveals that early larval conditions
   have effects on individuals long after metamorphosis.}},

Title = {{The psychiatric, psychological and addiction evaluation in bariatric
   surgery candidates: What should we assess, why and how?}},
Journal = {{PRESSE MEDICALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-39}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bariatric surgery is indicated in obese patients with a BMI >= 40
   kg/m(2) or >= 35 kg/m(2) with serious comorbidities, in second intention
   in patients who failed to achieve significant weight loss after a
   well-managed medical, nutritional and psychotherapeutic treatment for 6
   to 12 months, and in patients who are aware of the consequences of
   bariatric surgery and who agree with a long term medical and surgical
   follow-up. Such a treatment requires a preoperative multidisciplinary
   assessment and management, which includes a mandatory consultation with
   a psychiatrist or a psychologist that should be member of the
   multidisciplinary staff and participate in these staffs.
   Although one of this consultation's aim is to screen for the few
   patients who for which surgery is contra-indicated, in most cases, the
   main aim of this assessment is to screen for and manage psychiatric and
   psychopathologic disorders that could be temporary contra-indication,
   because these disorders could lead to poorer postoperative outcome when
   untreated. By explaining to the patient how these disorders could affect
   postoperative outcome and which benefits he could retrieve from their
   management, the patient will increase his motivation for change and he
   will be more likely to seek professional help for these disorders. In
   all cases, a systematic examination of the patient's personality and
   his/ her ability to understand the postoperative instructions is
   essential before surgery because clinicians should check that the
   patient is able to be adherent to postoperative instructions. In
   addition to clinical interview, use of self-administered questionnaires
   before the consultation might help to determine which psychiatric or
   psychopathologic factors should be more closely screened during the
   consultation.
   Psychiatric disorders and addictions are highly prevalent in this
   population (e. g., mood and anxiety disorders, binge eating disorder,
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addictions, personality
   disorders, pathological personality traits and dimensions), and when
   untreated, they can lead to poorer postoperative outcome (postoperative
   occurrence of psychiatric disorders, poorer quality of life, and
   sometimes to poorer weight loss or excessive weight rebound when the
   disorder is present during the postoperative period). A complementary
   training in addiction medicine is helpful given the higher risk for
   addictions in this population.
   Given that this evaluation is often the first meeting with a
   psychiatrist, an empathic and motivational approach is helpful to
   improve the patient's ability to request for a future psychiatric
   consultation during the follow-up.
   Some conditions are required for a high quality assessment: the
   objectives and expectations of the consultation should be systematically
   explained to the patient prior to the consultation by the physician who
   enquires for the assessment; it needs time; the psychiatrist should
   systematically be member of the multidisciplinary staff and should take
   part in regular multisciplinary staff meetings; patients should be seen
   alone to assess his/her readiness to change. After the consultation, a
   contact with the physician who enquires for the assessment should be
   systematic (e. g., use of a medical letter that sum up the main
   conclusions of the consultation; participation in regular
   multisciplinary staff meetings).}},

Title = {{Supplementation of Korean Red Ginseng improves behavior deviations in
   animal models of autism}},
Journal = {{FOOD \& NUTRITION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous
   neurodevelopmental disorders that primarily display social and
   communication impairments and restricted/repetitive behaviors. ASD
   prevalence has increased in recent years, yet very limited therapeutic
   targets and treatments are available to counteract the incapacitating
   disorder. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) is a popular herbal plant in South
   Korea known for its wide range of therapeutic effects and nutritional
   benefits and has recently been gaining great scientific attention,
   particularly for its positive effects in the central nervous system.
   Objectives: Thus, in this study, we investigated the therapeutic
   potential of KRG in alleviating the neuro-behavioral deficits found in
   the valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mice models of ASD.
   Design: Starting at 21 days old (P21), VPA-exposed mice were given daily
   oral administrations of KRG solution (100 or 200 mg/kg) until the
   termination of all experiments. From P28, mice behaviors were assessed
   in terms of social interaction capacity (P28 - 29), locomotor activity
   (P30), repetitive behaviors (P32), short-term spatial working memory
   (P34), motor coordination (P36), and seizure susceptibility (P38).
   Results: VPA-exposed mice showed sociability and social novelty
   preference deficits, hyperactivity, increased repetitive behavior,
   impaired spatial working memory, slightly affected motor coordination,
   and high seizure susceptibility. Remarkably, long-term KRG treatment in
   both dosages normalized all the ASD-related behaviors in VPA-exposed
   mice, except motor coordination ability.
   Conclusion: As a food and herbal supplement with various known benefits,
   KRG demonstrated its therapeutic potential in rescuing abnormal
   behaviors related to autism caused by prenatal environmental exposure to
   VPA.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in documenting and explaining the existence
   of marked intraspecific variation in metabolic rate in animals, with
   fishes providing some of the best-studied examples. After accounting for
   variation due to other factors, there can typically be a two to
   three-fold variation among individual fishes for both standard and
   maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR). This variation is reasonably
   consistent over time (provided that conditions remain stable), and its
   underlying causes may be influenced by both genes and developmental
   conditions. In this paper, current knowledge of the extent and causes of
   individual variation in SMR, MMR and aerobic scope (AS), collectively
   its metabolic phenotype, is reviewed and potential links among
   metabolism, behaviour and performance are described. Intraspecific
   variation in metabolism has been found to be related to other traits:
   fishes with a relatively high SMR tend to be more dominant and grow
   faster in high food environments, but may lose their advantage and are
   more prone to risk-taking when conditions deteriorate. In contrast to
   the wide body of research examining links between SMR and behavioural
   traits, very little work has been directed towards understanding the
   ecological consequences of individual variation in MMR and AS. Although
   AS can differ among populations of the same species in response to
   performance demands, virtually nothing is known about the effects of AS
   on individual behaviours such as those associated with foraging or
   predator avoidance. Further, while factors such as food availability,
   temperature, hypoxia and the fish's social environment are known to
   alter resting and MMRs in fishes, there is a paucity of studies
   examining how these effects vary among individuals, and how this
   variation relates to behaviour. Given the observed links between
   metabolism and measures of performance, understanding the metabolic
   responses of individuals to changing environments will be a key area for
   future research because the environment will have a strong influence on
   which animals survive predation, become dominant and ultimately have the
   highest reproductive success. Although current evidence suggests that
   variation in SMR may be maintained within populations via
   context-dependent fitness benefits, it is suggested that a more
   integrative approach is now required to fully understand how the
   environment can modulate individual performance via effects on metabolic
   phenotypes encompassing SMR, MMR and AS.}},

Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article shows how an interaction between economic constraints and
   children's taste preferences shapes low-income families' food decisions.
   According to studies of eating behavior, children often refuse
   unfamiliar foods 8 to 15 times before accepting them. Using 80
   interviews and 41 grocery-shopping observations with 73 primary
   caregivers in the Boston area in 2013-2015, I find that many low-income
   respondents minimize the risk of food waste by purchasing what their
   children like often calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. High-income
   study participants, who have greater resources to withstand the cost of
   uneaten food, are more likely to repeatedly introduce foods that their
   children initially refuse. Several conditions moderate the relationship
   between children's taste aversion and respondents' risk aversion,
   including household-level food preferences, respondents' conceptions of
   adult authority, and children's experiences outside of the home.
   Low-income participants' risk aversion may affect children's taste
   acquisition and eating habits, with implications for socioeconomic
   disparities in diet quality. This article proposes that the cost of
   providing children a healthy diet may include the possible cost of foods
   that children waste as they acquire new tastes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{1. Body condition indices, measures of body `plumpness' or mass relative
   to frame size, are often used as a proxy for lipid reserves or
   fitness-related traits of animals and assumed to be positively related
   to fitness.
   2. The quantification and analysis of body condition indices has been
   the subject of debate for decades. Here, we summarize three additional
   concerns with the use of body condition indices.
   3. First, body condition index is often poorly correlated with lipid
   content in animals. Second, even if body condition index and lipid
   content are correlated, lipid content of an animal may not be the most
   important aspect of body composition influencing fitness. Finally,
   neither body condition index nor lipid reserves are likely to be
   directly positively related to fitness in animals, as many animals
   homeostatically regulate intermediate levels of condition index or lipid
   reserves, with both higher and lower values incurring fitness costs.
   4. A wide range of analytical methods, including some relatively
   inexpensive and simple measures, are available for more detailed
   measures of animal body composition or fitness-related traits. Replacing
   body condition indices with more direct measures of body composition -
   even relatively simple measures - can inform understanding of the
   physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses in a wide range of

Abstract = {{A key aspect of cooperation is partner choice: choosing the best
   available partner improves the chances of a successful cooperative
   interaction and decreases the likelihood of being exploited. However, in
   studies on cooperation subjects are rarely allowed to freely choose
   their partners. Group-living animals live in a complex social
   environment where they can choose among several social partners
   differing in, for example, sex, age, temperament, or dominance status.
   Our study investigated whether wild Barbary macaques succeed to
   cooperate using an experimental apparatus, and whether individual and
   social factors affect their choice of partners and the degree of
   cooperation. We used the string pulling task that requires two monkeys
   to manipulate simultaneously a rope in order to receive a food reward.
   The monkeys were free to interact with the apparatus or not and to
   choose their partner. The results showed that Barbary macaques are able
   to pair up with a partner to cooperate using the apparatus. High level
   of tolerance between monkeys was necessary for the initiation of
   successful cooperation, while strong social bond positively affected the
   maintenance of cooperative interactions. Dominance status, sex, age, and
   temperament of the subjects also affected their choice and performance.
   These factors thus need to be taken into account in cooperative
   experiment on animals. Tolerance between social partners is likely to be
   a prerequisite for the evolution of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Prey use chemical cues from predation events to obtain information about
   predation risk to alter their phenotypes. Though we know how many prey
   respond to predators, we still have a poor understanding of the
   processes and chemical cues involved during a predation event. We
   examined how gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) altered their
   behavior and morphology when raised with cues from different stages of
   predator attack, predators fed different amounts of prey, and predators
   consuming different combinations of treefrog tadpoles or snails
   (Helisoma trivolvis). We found that starved predators and predators fed
   snails induced no defensive responses whereas tadpoles exposed to a
   predator consuming gray treefrogs induced greater hiding, lower
   activity, and relatively deeper tails. We also found that the tadpoles
   did not respond to crushed, chewed, or digested conspecifics, but they
   did respond to consumed (i.e., chewed plus digested) conspecifics. When
   we increased the treefrog biomass consumed by predators, tadpoles
   frequently increased their defenses when only tadpoles were consumed and
   always increased their defenses when the total diet biomass was held
   constant via the inclusion of snails. When predators experienced
   temporal variation in diet composition, including cues from snails to
   cause additional digestive cues or chemical noise, there was no effect
   on tadpole phenotypes. Our results suggest that amphibian prey rely on
   cues from both chewing and digestion of conspecifics and that the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{41-47}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Past risk-sensitive foraging studies commonly manipulated delay to
   reward and reward magnitude, but recent risk-sensitive foraging research
   revealed that changes in reward quality resulted in changes in a
   forager's preference for a variable or fixed return. However, no studies
   have investigated the effects of changes in reward quality and delay to
   reward on risk sensitivity. Therefore, the current experiment was
   designed to explore rats' preference for a variable or fixed option when
   delay to reward and reward quality were manipulated. Using a
   within-subjects, ABACADA design, rats (N = 10) choose between a variable
   and constant option that delivered six food pellets but the amount of
   sugar (i.e. reward quality) and delay to reward differed per condition.
   In each baseline condition, pellets were 100\% sugar and delivered after
   a 2 s mean delay. Subjects displayed a significant preference for the
   variable option in all baseline conditions. In condition B, pellets were
   20\% sugar, delivered after a 2 s mean delay, and rats were risk
   indifferent. In condition C, rats displayed a significant preference for
   the variable option when delay was 10 s and reward quality was 100\%.
   Finally, in condition D, subjects showed the strongest variable option
   responses among all treatments when both reward quality and delay to
   reward were manipulated (i.e. 20\% sugar pellets and 10 s mean delay).
   Preference was assessed relative to the daily energy budget rule, the
   scalar utility theory and the sequential choice model. The sequential
   choice model provided the most comprehensive and accurate prediction of
   subjects' preferences. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{The success of new food technologies largely depends on consumers'
   behavioral responses to the innovation. In Eastern Africa, and Uganda in
   particular, a technology to process matooke into flour has been
   introduced with limited success. We measure and apply the Food
   technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS) to this specific case. This technique
   has been increasingly used in consumer research to determine consumers'
   fear for foods produced by novel technologies. Although it has been
   successful in developed countries, the low number and limited scope of
   past studies underlines the need for testing its applicability in a
   developing country context. Data was collected from 209 matooke
   consumers from Central Uganda. In general, respondents are relatively
   neophobic towards the new technology, with an average FTNS score of
   58.7\%, which hampers the success of processed matooke flour. Besides
   socio-demographic indicators, `risk perception', `healthiness' and the
   `necessity of technologies' were key factors that influenced consumer's
   preference of processed matooke flour. Benchmarking the findings against
   previous FTNS surveys allows to evaluate factor solutions, compare
   standardized FTNS scores and further lends support for the
   multidimensionality of the FTNS. Being the first application in a
   developing country context, this study provides a case for examining
   food technology neophobia for processed staple crops in various regions
   and cultures. Nevertheless, research is needed to replicate this method
   and evaluate the external validity of our findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Freshwater fishes utilising seasonally available habitats within annual
   migratory circuits time movements out of such habitats with changing
   hydrology, although individual attributes of fish may also mediate the
   behavioural response to environmental conditions. We tagged juvenile
   Arctic grayling in a seasonally flowing stream on the Arctic Coastal
   Plain in Alaska and recorded migration timing towards overwintering
   habitat. We examined the relationship between individual migration date,
   and fork length (FL) and body condition index (BCI) for fish tagged in
   June, July and August in three separate models. Larger fish migrated
   earlier; however, only the August model suggested a significant
   relationship with BCI. In this model, 42\% of variability in migration
   timing was explained by FL and BCI, and fish in better condition were
   predicted to migrate earlier than those in poor condition. Here, the
   majority (33\%) of variability was captured by FL with an additional 9\%
   attributable to BCI. We also noted strong seasonal trends in BCI
   reflecting overwinter mass loss and subsequent growth within the study
   area. These results are interpreted in the context of size and energetic
   state-specific risks of overwinter starvation and mortality (which can
   be very high in the Arctic), which may influence individuals at greater
   risk to extend summer foraging in a risky, yet prey rich, habitat. Our
   research provides further evidence that heterogeneity among individuals
   within a population can influence migratory behaviour and identifies
   potential risks to late season migrants in Arctic beaded stream habitats
   influenced by climate change and petroleum development.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Non-lethal management of wildlife, both ``problem wildlife{''} and pest
   species, to protect crops and threatened species is becoming
   increasingly important as non-human animals and humans come into closer
   proximity. A particularly promising approach is to apply predator scents
   to manipulate the cost/benefit ratio that influences the behavioral
   decisions made by prey and other predators about where to forage or
   rest. However, such olfactory manipulations are not always successful.
   Using insights from size-structured food webs, we develop a novel
   integrative model of the information that animals acquire from
   eavesdropping on predator and conspecific scents. We show how animals
   can use the information content in predator scents to derive knowledge
   of other predators and competitors and thus influence their decision to
   stay in or leave an area. This model framework clarifies how predator
   scents can influence all trophic levels, from interference competition
   directed at smaller predators, to predation and herbivory, and exploits
   direct and indirect pathways to promote landscapes of fear that
   influence spatial and temporal patch use in target animals. We
   illustrate how the application of this conceptual model can focus future
   research to enhance the use of predator scent-based deterrents in
   conservation and management. This integrated model shows great promise

Abstract = {{Background The idiopathic variety of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in India
   particularly in Kerala state was earlier called `tropical pancreatitis'
   with peculiar features: early age of onset, severe malnutrition,
   diabetes and poor prognosis. A change in disease phenotype and behaviour
   has been observed recently.
   Objective To review the changing profile of CP in India and examine its
   relationship with environmental influences and socio-economic
   development.
   Methods Relevant studies on CP in India were reviewed along with social
   and economic parameters in Kerala over the past 4 decades.
   Results There has been a definite change in the phenotype of CP in India
   with onset in mid twenties, better nutritional status, and a much better
   prognosis compared with the reports in 1970s. Genetic susceptibility due
   to genetic mutations particularly in SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC, and CLDN2/MORC4
   genes is the most important factor and not malnutrition or dietary
   toxins for idiopathic CP suggesting the term `tropical pancreatitis' is
   a misnomer. We observed a close relationship between socio-economic

   Daphnia magna}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Increased population density may lead to a decrease in energy available
   for growth and reproduction via effects on the activity level of
   individuals. Whilst this may be of particular importance for organisms
   that compete for defendable resources and/or have a high frequency of
   social interactions, it is less obvious how individual activity should
   covary with population density when food resources are not defendable or
   direct interactions among individuals are negligible. Based on
   observations that there is a general negative relationship between
   population density and metabolism it has been suggested that organisms
   actively reduce activity under increased density to accommodate an
   expected decrease in food availability. However, in the absence of
   direct activity measurements the validity of this hypothesis is unclear.
   Here we test for such anticipatory adjustments of activity levels in the
   planktonic cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus, a filter feeder whose food
   resources are not defendable, meaning that density responses can be
   evaluated in the absence of direct interactions. We tested for changes
   in activity in response to two separate density cues, one being the
   direct physical and visual stimuli resulting from being in the vicinity
   of conspecifics ('direct density experiment'), and the other being the
   detection of olfactory cues in their environment ('olfactory cue
   experiment'). Ten genetically distinct clones were used to evaluate the
   potential for genetic variation in these responses. Our measures of
   activity were highly repeatable, and there was significant variation in
   activity among clones. Furthermore, this clonal variation was consistent
   in the `direct density' and `olfactory cue' experiments. The estimated
   evolvability of the trait (1.3-3.2\%) was within the range typically
   observed in behavioural traits. However, there was no indication that
   the activity level of individuals respond to population density, either
   directly to actual density or to olfactory cues representing high
   density. In this case, the energetic influence of density on population
   dynamics is sufficiently described by effects on per capita resource
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental stressors including protein malnutrition (PMN) during

   addresses the larger window from gestation to F1 generation, a new model
   of intra-generational PMN. Naive Sprague Dawley (SD) dams
   pre-gestationally switched to LP (8\% protein) or HP (20\% protein)
   diets for 45 days were bred and maintained throughout gestation on same

   Intra-generational PMN induced poor habituation-with-time in novel

Abstract = {{Social relationships are fundamental to animals living in complex
   societies {[}1-3]. The extent to which individuals base their decisions
   around their key social relationships, and the consequences this has on
   their behavior and broader population level processes, remains unknown.
   Using a novel experiment that controlled where individual wild birds
   (great tits, Parus major) could access food, we restricted mated pairs
   from being allowed to forage at the same locations. This introduced a
   conflict for pair members between maintaining social relationships and
   accessing resources. We show that individuals reduce their own access to
   food in order to sustain their relationships and that individual
   foraging activity was strongly influenced by their key social
   counterparts. By affecting where individuals go, social relationships
   determined which conspecifics they encountered and consequently shaped
   their other social associations. Hence, while resource distribution can
   determine individuals' spatial and social environment {[}4-8], we
   illustrate how key social relationships themselves can govern broader
   social structure. Finally, social relationships also influenced the
   development of social foraging strategies. In response to forgoing
   access to resources, maintaining pair bonds led individuals to develop a
   flexible ``scrounging{''} strategy, particularly by scrounging from
   their pair mate. This suggests that behavioral plasticity can develop to
   ameliorate conflicts between social relationships and other demands.
   Together, these results illustrate the importance of considering social
   relationships for explaining behavioral variation due to their
   significant impact on individual behavior and demonstrate the
   consequences of key relationships for wider processes.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian disturbance often yields stream amphibian declines, yet some

   Understanding behaviors of individuals that select to occupy degraded
   habitat provides important insight into amphibian declines and may
   identify effective targets for management. Our objective was to evaluate
   whether fine-scale habitat selection behaviors and responses to
   environmental cues differed between individuals inhabiting disturbed
   versus undisturbed habitats. Specifically, we evaluated habitat
   selection and movement biases by larval Desmognathus quadramaculatus
   (Black-bellied Salamanders) from streams with and without riparian
   forest cover to different habitat cues. In a laboratory setting, we
   observed habitat selection with respect to light, a potential predator,
   and refuge, and also recorded exploratory movement to determine if
   salamanders occupying deforested stream reaches exhibited bold
   behavioral syndromes. We found that salamanders did not exhibit
   correlated behaviors indicative of bold or shy behavioral syndromes, but
   individuals from deforested stream reaches were less responsive to
   light. Secondly, we evaluated reactive behaviors by exposing salamanders
   to different light regimes. Individuals from deforested reaches
   exhibited greater reactivity to match their habituated light regime.
   Individuals originating from deforested habitats had relatively poor
   body conditions, indicating that individuals from deforested streams may
   experience additional costs relative to those from forested habitats.
   Despite demonstrated declines in abundance of aquatic salamanders
   following riparian disturbance, our results indicated that individuals
   that exhibit high behavioral plasticity are capable of inhabiting
   altered stream habitats and may represent the future of populations in

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Three factors potentially facilitating avian urban colonisation are: (a)
   inherent suitability for city environments, (b) limited resource overlap
   with residents, achieved through resource partitioning or outcompeting
   residents for shared resources, and (c) behavioural flexibility
   permitting innovative resource exploitation. We examined the foraging
   ecology and nest site choice of the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala)
   in urban parks in Melbourne, Australia to elucidate which of these three
   factors was likely to be instrumental in facilitating occupancy of this
   urban habitat by this native honeyeater. The Noisy Miner was relatively
   unspecialised in its nest site choice in parks, suggesting that the many
   suburban parks with branching eucalypts probably provide lots of
   suitable nest sites for this species. Park-dwelling Noisy Miners
   appeared to be superior competitors for food to most cohabiting bird
   species. They were never targets of interspecific aggression, but quite
   often initiated it against 16 other bird species. Most interactions were
   attacks and/or chases and 74\% displaced the target species' member. In
   Melbourne's parks, Noisy Miners foraged for invertebrates mainly: (a) in
   the subcanopy on foliage, using hanging and reaching behaviours, and (b)
   on the ground on bark litter and grass, gleaning in a standing posture.
   Several cohabiting bird species also gleaned invertebrates on the ground
   in a similar manner, but all also commonly used other behaviours when
   foraging on this substrate. No cohabiting species that foraged
   extensively in the sub-canopy fed substantially on invertebrates there.
   Thus Noisy Miners could successfully inhabit Melbourne's parks
   apparently at least partly because: (i) nest site choice was relatively
   unspecialised; (ii) they flexibly exploited food resources at ground
   level, unlike exurban conspecifics; (iii) they aggressively dominated
   possible heterospecific food competitors at ground level; and (iv) they
   probably experienced fairly limited dietary overlap with cohabiting bird
   species.}},

   Objective Using a cross-sectional study design, we aimed to explore both
   dieticians' and patients' adoption of SDM behaviours in dietetic
   consultations regarding the nutritional treatment of dyslipidaemia.
   Methods Twenty-six dieticians working in local health clinics in the
   Quebec City metropolitan area were each asked to identify one
   dyslipidaemic patient they would see in an upcoming consultation. Based
   on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), questionnaires were designed
   to study two targeted SDM behaviours: `to discuss nutritional treatment
   options for dyslipidaemia' and `to discuss patients' values and
   preferences about nutritional treatment options for dyslipidaemia'.
   These questionnaires were administered to the dietician-patient dyad
   individually before the consultation. Associations between TPB
   constructs (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control)
   towards behavioural intentions were analysed using Spearman's partial

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Previous theoretical studies suggest that a species' landscape should
   influence the evolution of its dispersal characteristics, because
   landscape structure affects the costs and benefits of dispersal.
   However, these studies have not considered the evolution of boundary
   crossing, that is, the tendency of animals to cross from habitat to
   nonhabitat ({''}matrix{''}). It is important to understand this
   dispersal behavior, because of its effects on the probability of
   population persistence. Boundary-crossing behavior drives the rate of
   interaction with matrix, and thus, it influences the rate of movement
   among populations and the risk of dispersal mortality. We used an
   individual-based, spatially explicit model to simulate the evolution of
   boundary crossing in response to landscape structure. Our simulations
   predict higher evolved probabilities of boundary crossing in landscapes
   with more habitat, less fragmented habitat, higher-quality matrix, and
   more frequent disturbances (i.e., fewer generations between local
   population extinction events). Unexpectedly, our simulations also
   suggest that matrix quality and disturbance frequency have much stronger
   effects on the evolution of boundary crossing than either habitat amount
   or habitat fragmentation. Our results suggest that boundary-crossing
   responses are most affected by the costs of dispersal through matrix and
   the benefits of escaping local extinction events. Evolution of optimal
   behavior at habitat boundaries in response to the landscape may have

Abstract = {{Obesity is associated with a range of health outcomes that are of
   clinical and public health significance, including cancer. Herein, we
   summarize epidemiologic and preclinical evidence for an association
   between obesity and increased risk of breast and prostate cancer
   incidence and mortality. Moreover, we describe data from observational
   studies of weight change in humans and from calorie-restriction studies
   in mouse models that support a potential role for weight loss in
   counteracting tumor-promoting properties of obesity in breast and
   prostate cancers. Given that weight loss is challenging to achieve and
   maintain, we also consider evidence linking treatments for
   obesity-associated co-morbidities, including metformin, statins and
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with reduced breast and prostate
   cancer incidence and mortality. Finally, we highlight several challenges
   that should be considered when conducting epidemiologic and preclinical
   research in the area of obesity and cancer, including the measurement of
   obesity in population-based studies, the timing of obesity and weight
   change in relation to tumor latency and cancer diagnosis, and the
   heterogeneous nature of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Given
   that obesity is a complex trait, comprised of behavioral, epidemiologic
   and molecular/metabolic factors, we argue that a transdisciplinary
   approach is the key to understanding the mechanisms linking obesity and
   cancer. As such, this review highlights the critical need to integrate
   evidence from both epidemiologic and preclinical studies to gain insight
   into both biologic and non-biologic mechanisms contributing to the
   obesity-cancer link.}},

Title = {{Symbiont transmission entails the risk of parasite infection}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Like many animals, firebugs (Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae) rely on
   behavioural adaptations to successfully endow their offspring with
   microbial mutualists. To transmit the nutritionally beneficial
   Coriobacteriaceae symbionts, female firebugs smear egg surfaces with
   symbiont-containing faecal droplets that are subsequently ingested by
   newly hatched nymphs through active probing to initiate infection.
   Alternatively, the symbionts can be acquired horizontally through
   contact with faeces of infected conspecifics. Here, we report that these
   adaptations ensuring successful transmission of bacterial symbionts
   among firebugs are exploited by the specialized trypanosomatid parasite
   Leptomonas pyrrhocoris. Using comparative transcriptomics, fluorescence
   in situ hybridization (FISH) and controlled bioassays, we demonstrate
   that the transmission cycle of L. pyrrhocoris mirrors that of the
   bacterial mutualists, with high efficiency for both vertical and
   horizontal transmission. This indicates that the parasite capitalizes on
   pre-existing behavioural adaptations (egg smearing and probing) to
   facilitate its own transfer within host populations, adaptations that
   likely evolved to initiate and maintain an association with beneficial
   gut symbionts. Thus, the transmission of mutualistic microbes across
   host generations can entail a significant risk of co-transmitting
   pathogens or parasites, thereby exerting selective pressures on the host
   to evolve more specific mechanisms of transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Omnivorous arthropods make dietary choices according to the environment
   in which they forage, mainly availability/quality of plant and/or prey
   resources. Such decisions and their subsequent impacts on life-history
   traits may be affected by the availability of nutrients and water to
   plants, that is, through bottom-up forces. By setting up arenas for
   feeding behavior observation as well as glasshouse cages for plant
   preference assessment, we studied effects of the presence of prey
   (Lepidoptera eggs) and nitrogen/water availability to host tomato plants
   on the foraging behavior and life-history traits in the omnivorous
   predator Macrolophus pygmaeus (Heteroptera: Miridae). In the absence of
   prey, the predator fed equally on the plants treated with various levels
   of nitrogen and water. In the presence of prey, however, the feeding
   rate on plants decreased when the plant received low water input. The
   feeding rate on prey was positively correlated with feeding rate on
   plants; that is, prey feeding increased with plant feeding when the
   plants received high water input. Moreover, plants receiving high water
   input attracted more M.pygmaeus adults compared with those receiving low
   water input. For M.pygmaeus fitness, the presence of prey enhanced its
   fertility and longevity, but the longevity decreased when plants
   received low compared with high water input. In conclusion, the
   omnivorous predator may be obliged to feed on plants to obtain water,
   and plant water status may be a limiting factor for the foraging
   behavior and fitness of the omnivorous predator.}},

Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The deleterious effect of competition for space and food in animals
   increases with increasing population density. In contrast, familiarity
   towards conspecifics can relax the intensity of interference
   competition. Here, we hypothesized that familiarity towards conspecifics
   mitigates the effect of density-dependent growth and dispersal behaviour
   in territorial animals. To test this, wild-captured juvenile brown trout
   were subjected to two consecutive laboratory experiments. First, growth
   and fin erosion were measured for 40 d in a 2 x 2 factorial design
   manipulating density and familiarity. The density was manipulated via
   size of experimental tanks, while per capita food abundance and fish
   number was constant. All fish were subsequently exposed to an emergence
   test, giving them the option to leave their group and disperse to a
   novel unoccupied environment. The results show that familiarity
   increases growth and decreases the level of fin erosion (i.e. proxy of
   intensity of aggressive interactions). We found no significant effect of
   population density on growth rate. However, there was a tendency towards
   higher fin erosion in fish kept under high density. The growth of
   individuals was also affected by their size rank within the group, with
   the largest individuals in each group growing disproportionally faster
   than the rest of the group, probably due to their high social rank.
   However, the second and third fish in the size rank did not grow
   significantly faster and tended to suffer higher mortality than the rest
   of the group. During the emergence test, the largest individuals in the
   familiar groups left the shelter either as the first (six of 12 groups)
   or last (five of 12 groups) individual in the group, while no such
   pattern was observed in unfamiliar groups. Our results suggest that
   individuals in familiar groups receive less aggression and stress (i.e.
   fin damage) and grow faster than fish in unfamiliar groups. The
   mechanisms indicated in this laboratory study may be especially
   important in highly fecund organisms like fish which undergo
   density-dependent bottlenecks during early life.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Group-foraging animals can coordinate their activities by performing
   positive signals that increase foraging or inhibitory signals that
   decrease recruitment when foragers detect danger. However, it is unclear
   whether foragers tune their excitatory and inhibitory signalling
   according to food value and predation risk. We therefore studied the
   signals that honeybee foragers perform before and after being attacked
   by live predators (wasps and spiders) or a robo-predator at a nectar
   source. Predator attacks significantly reduced recruitment dancing and
   increased stop signalling, which inhibits dancing for the dangerous
   resource. Attack equally reduced dancing for all sucrose concentrations.
   However, foragers factored travel costs into their positive signalling.
   At the feeder with greater travel cost (100 m), bees danced less when
   they responded more severely to attacks. At the low travel cost feeder
   (1 m), there was no significant effect of attack response severity upon
   dancing. Attacks increased inhibitory signal production. Live and
   robo-predator attacks elicited 131-fold more stop signals from foragers
   as compared to control treatments of freshly dead predators that did not
   attack. However, food profitability, distance and sucrose concentration
   did not alter stop signalling. We suggest that this pattern may
   generally characterize excitatory/inhibitory signal pairs in group
   foraging. Foragers tune positive signalling (recruitment) to food
   quality and peril, and this is countered by an inhibitory signal that is
   tuned to danger but not resource value. (C) 2015 The Association for the

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{113-119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Precopulatory sexual cannibalism is an extreme form of sexual conflict
   because it has the potential to eliminate current and future
   reproductive success for males. Several female factors such as body
   condition, mating status and orientation are predicted to impact the
   likelihood of cannibalism, and males are expected to respond to these
   factors by altering their approach behaviours in ways that minimize the
   chance of being attacked (i.e. slower approach and greater distance at
   mounting). We used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid
   Pseudomantis albofimbriata to test whether and how certain female risk
   factors affect male approach and mating behaviour. We created three
   different risk treatments by manipulating female body condition, mating
   status and orientation, and recorded the frequency of cannibalism, male
   mating success, male approach behaviours and copulation duration. As
   predicted, female body condition and mating status had an effect on the
   frequency of sexual cannibalism, and cannibalized males had
   significantly lower mating success than noncannibalized males. Female
   orientation was the least important factor in determining the rate of
   sexual cannibalism in this system, with no significant difference
   between front-and rear-facing females. Contrary to what we predicted,
   male P. albofimbriata did not alter/shape their approach or mating
   behaviours relative to any of the proposed female risk factors of sexual
   cannibalism. There was also no difference in copulation duration between
   cannibalized and noncannibalized males. Future studies that investigate
   the effect of sexual cannibalism on postcopulatory male mating
   strategies will provide better clarification of the costs and benefits
   of sexual cannibalism in this system and will also be useful in
   understanding why males do not respond to the risk of sexual cannibalism
   in a precopulatory scenario. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Although dietary habits can affect colorectal cancer (CRC)
   survivors' health, it is unclear how familiar survivors are with dietary
   guidelines, what they believe about healthy eating and alcohol
   consumption, and what hinders healthy dietary habits after cancer. This
   study assessed CRC survivors' familiarity with dietary guidelines, their
   eating and drinking habits, and perceived facilitators and barriers to
   healthy eating after cancer, including social support and self-efficacy
   for maintaining a healthy diet and limiting alcohol.
   Methods: A total of 593 individuals (50\% female; mean age, 74 years)
   diagnosed with CRC approximately 6 years prior to study entry in early
   2010 were identified through California Cancer Registry records and
   participated in a cross-sectional mailed survey assessing health
   behavior after cancer (46\% adjusted response rate). Analyses were
   conducted in 2014-2015.
   Results: Survivors were most familiar with and most likely to
   follow-recommendations to choose low-fat foods; 15\% had never heard of
   recommendations to limit alcohol. Survivors were more aware of
   recommendations involving messages to limit/avoid versus approach/choose
   certain foods. The most common barrier to a healthy diet involved the
   effort required (26\%). Survivors received more family/friend support
   and provider recommendations for healthy eating than limiting alcohol.
   Conclusions: Results provide an overview of awareness of and adherence
   to dietary recommendations among CRC survivors, highlighting the need
   for increasing awareness of recommendations that are especially relevant
   for survivors. Suggestions are made for modifying diet-related messages
   to facilitate comprehension and recall among CRC survivors, and
   increasing awareness among groups with the lowest awareness levels.

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate, in a representative sample of high
   school students, the psychometric characteristics of the Italian version
   of the CEBRACS scale (Rahal et al., 2011), a questionnaire investigating
   compensatory eating behaviors correlated with alcohol consumption. These
   behaviors are adopted to make up for calories consumed through the
   drinking of alcohol and/or to enhance the intoxicative effects of
   alcohol. Study participants were selected from an initial sample of 965
   students. Out of the 965 youths originally recruited, 640 (376 males and
   264 females) reported drinking alcohol over the previous 3 months, and
   were considered eligible for the purpose of the study. The following
   questionnaires were administered: CEBRACS, Alcohol Use Disorders
   Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders, 1993), and the Eating Disorder
   Inventory-3 (EDI-3) (Garner, 2004). Test/retest reproducibility was
   evaluated on a subgroup of 189 youths. The factorial structure, internal
   consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of CEBRACS
   were evaluated. Factor analysis of inter-item correlation indicated 5
   factors as being better suited to describe data, with an estimated
   68.85\% variance: ``Alcohol Effect, ``Laxative Use{''}, ``Dietary
   Restraint and Exercise{''}, ``Diuretic Use{''}, ``Restriction and
   Vomiting{''}. A high degree of reproducibility and homogeneity (ICC =
   0.806; Cronbach's Alpha = 0.886) of the scale was detected. A
   significant correlation was revealed between CEBRACS, the three eating
   disorder risk scales comprised in EDI-3 and scores and clinical risk
   yielded by AUDIT. The overall reliability and validity of the CEBRACS
   scale was confirmed in an extensive sample of Italian students,
   highlighting a satisfactory construct validity, good internal
   consistency and good degree of reproducibility. In view of the relevance
   of the problem, associated with serious health risks, a more widespread
   investigation of the phenomenon should be conducted using evaluation

Abstract = {{Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is an important risk factor for
   cardiovascular disease and affects worldwide population. Current

   phenotypic plasticity and refers to the adjustment of a phenotype in
   response to environmental stimuli without genetic change, following a

Abstract = {{Understanding space use remains a major challenge for animal ecology,
   with implications for species interactions, disease spread, and
   conservation. Behavioural type (BT) may shape the space use of
   individuals within animal populations. Bolder or more aggressive
   individuals tend to be more exploratory and disperse further. Yet, to
   date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal
   depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent
   space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern
   Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS)
   tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays,
   and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge
   resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that
   lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the
   neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other
   conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially
   aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to
   ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of
   these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when
   food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For
   example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the
   season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these
   predictors. These findings highlight a commonly overlooked source of
   heterogeneity in animal space use and improve our mechanistic
   understanding of processes leading to behaviourally driven disease
   dynamics and social structure.}},

Abstract = {{Many echinoderm larvae exhibit phenotypic plasticity: a change in

   phenotypic plasticity in the larvae of the crown-of-thorns seastar
   Acanthaster planci, an opportunistic boom-and-bust species with larvae
   that have a strong response to food conditions. The increased predation
   pressure resulting from outbreaks (population explosions) of A. planci
   is deleterious to coral reefs, but the link between population outbreaks
   and larval ecology is poorly understood. We hypothesised that the larvae
   of A. planci would have a different morphological profile in the
   oligotrophic conditions typical of tropical waters than in the eutrophic
   conditions associated with increased nutrients. We predicted that larvae
   reared in low food conditions would increase their ciliated band length
   to enhance feeding potential. Larvae were fed algal concentrations
   representing starvation (0 cells ml(-1)), low food (oligo trophic; 1000
   cells ml(-1)), high food (eutrophic; 10 000 cells ml(-1)) or excessive
   food (100 000 cells ml(-1)) conditions. A phenotypic response was
   evident. Larvae in the 2 high food treatments had a shorter ciliated
   band length relative to body size. Conversely, larvae in the starvation
   and low food treatments had longer ciliated bands relative to body size,
   a change that would enhance particle capture capacity and facilitate
   larval success. This plastic response of the larvae of A. planci could
   have flow-on effects to adult populations, potentially facilitating

Title = {{Individual honey bee (Apis cerana) foragers adjust their fuel load to
   match variability in forage reward}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Animals may adjust their behavior according to their perception of risk.
   Here we show that free-flying honey bee (Apis cerana) foragers mitigate
   the risk of starvation in the field when foraging on a food source that
   offers variable rewards by carrying more `fuel' food on their outward
   journey. We trained foragers to a feeder located 1.2 km from each of
   four colonies. On average foragers carried 12.7\% greater volume of
   fuel, equivalent to 30.2\% more glucose when foraging on a variable
   source (a random sequence of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 M sucrose solution,
   average sucrose content 1.5 M) than when forging on a consistent source
   (constant 1.5 M sucrose solution). Our findings complement an earlier
   study that showed that foragers decrease their fuel load as they become
   more familiar with a foraging place. We suggest that honey bee foragers
   are risk sensitive, and carry more fuel to minimize the risk of
   starvation in the field when a foraging trip is perceived as being
   risky, either because the forager is unfamiliar with the foraging site,
   or because the forage available at a familiar site offers variable
   rewards.}},

Title = {{Costs of Foraging Predispose Animals to Obesity-Related Mortality when
   Food Is Constantly Abundant}},
Journal = {{PLoS One}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Obesity is an important medical problem affecting humans and animals in
   the developed world, but the evolutionary origins of the behaviours that
   cause obesity are poorly understood. The potential role of occasional
   gluts of food in determining fat-storage strategies for avoiding
   mortality have been overlooked, even though animals experienced such
   conditions in the recent evolutionary past and may follow the same
   strategies in the modern environment. Humans, domestic, and captive
   animals in the developed world are exposed to a surplus of calorie-rich
   food, conditions characterised as `constant-glut'. Here, we use a
   mathematical model to demonstrate that obesity-related mortality from
   poor health in a constant-glut environment should equal the average
   mortality rate in the `pre-modern' environment when predation risk was
   more closely linked with foraging. It should therefore not be surprising
   that animals exposed to abundant food often over-eat to the point of
   ill-health. Our work suggests that individuals tend to defend a given
   excessive level of reserves because this level was adaptive when gluts
   were short-lived. The model predicts that mortality rate in
   constant-glut conditions can increase as the assumed health cost of
   being overweight decreases, meaning that any adaptation that reduced
   such health costs would have counter-intuitively led to an increase in
   mortality in the modern environment. Taken together, these results imply
   that efforts to reduce the incidence of obesity that are focussed on
   altering individual behaviour are likely to be ineffective because
   modern, constant-glut conditions trigger previously adaptive behavioural
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to apply a protocol to evaluate the welfare of
   horses used for reproduction purposes and to compare the welfare
   conditions of two management types. A protocol adapted to the equine
   species was carried out by direct observation of 45 indicators in two
   subpopulations (49 stabled stallions and 43 broodmares in semi-freedom).
   Welfare assessment included behaviour, health, and the way in which
   animals responded to two different managements. Results revealed
   significant differences (P <= 0.05) of animal welfare under different
   management conditions. Regarding the individual area's safety and
   dimensions, the assessment showed that only in stallions the individual
   area was insufficient (85\%) with a higher risk of injury (20.54\%). In
   terms of feeding regime, a higher percentage of stallions left feed
   crumbs (26.19\%) and presented increased scores of body condition
   (42.86\%). In addition, abnormal behaviour was only observed on 8.16\%
   of the housed animals. Health indicators showed higher incidence of
   lameness (41.68\%), pain in the back (62.79\%) and tail broken hairs
   (27.66\%) in stallions; while the severity of injuries in the neck and
   back (55.81\%) was higher in females as well as the rate of nasal
   discharge (11.63\%). The methodology for evaluating welfare allowed to
   determine the incidence of health problems and behavioural responses,

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Approximately 10\% of U.S. infants and toddlers are
   considered overweight. Hispanic infants persistently show higher
   prevalence rates for being overweight compared to other infants. Little
   is known about factors promoting excessive infant weight gain in
   Latinos.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe multidimensional factors
   and maternal feeding practices that may correlate with infant
   overfeeding in Latina mothers.
   Methods: Participants were 62 low-income immigrant Latina mothers and
   their infants. Study measures were: acculturation; maternal feeding
   beliefs and practices; food availability; temperament; 24-hour dietary
   recall; and infant's weight-for-height z score.
   Results: In regression models adjusted for infant's age, healthier
   feeding practices were significantly predicted by maternal education and
   infant's age. Most mothers preferred feeding their infants either
   formula or a combination of breast milk and formula. A significant
   proportion of the infants were overweight or obese and yet some mothers
   displayed difficulty recognizing this problem.
   Conclusion: Future intervention efforts should focus primarily on the
   promotion of healthy feeding practices that discourage overfeeding and
   support exclusive breastfeeding among this ethnic group. (C) 2015

Journal = {{Ecology and Evolution}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4747-4756}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The mere presence of predators (i.e., predation risk) can alter consumer
   physiology by restricting food intake and inducing stress, which can
   ultimately affect prey-mediated ecosystem processes such as nutrient
   cycling. However, many environmental factors, including conspecific
   density, can mediate the perception of risk by prey. Prey conspecific
   density has been defined as a fundamental feature that modulates
   perceived risk. In this study, we tested the effects of predation risk
   on prey nutrient stoichiometry (body and excretion). Using a constant
   predation risk, we also tested the effects of varying conspecific
   densities on prey responses to predation risk. To answer these
   questions, we conducted a mesocosm experiment using caged predators
   (Belostoma sp.), and small bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus)
   as prey. We found that L.catesbeianus tadpoles adjust their body
   nutrient stoichiometry in response to predation risk, which is affected
   by conspecific density. We also found that the prey exhibited strong
   morphological responses to predation risk (i.e., an increase in tail
   muscle mass), which were positively correlated to body nitrogen content.
   Thus, we pose the notion that in risky situations, adaptive phenotypic
   responses rather than behavioral ones might partially explain why prey
   might have a higher nitrogen content under predation risk. In addition,
   the interactive roles of conspecific density and predation risk, which
   might result in reduced perceived risk and physiological restrictions in
   prey, also affected how prey stoichiometry responded to the fear of
   predation.}},

Abstract = {{Survival through periods of resource scarcity depends on the balance
   between metabolic demands and energy storage. The opposing effects of
   predation and starvation mortality are predicted to result in trade-offs
   between traits that optimize fitness during periods of resource plenty
   (e.g., during the growing season) and those that optimize fitness during
   periods of resource scarcity (e.g., during the winter). We conducted a
   common environment experiment with two genetically distinct strains of
   rainbow trout to investigate trade-offs due to (1) the balance of growth
   and predation risk related to foraging rate during the growing season
   and (2) the allocation of energy to body size prior to the winter. Fry
   (age 0) from both strains were stocked into replicate natural lakes at
   low and high elevation that differed in winter duration (i.e., ice
   cover) by 59 days. Overwinter survival was lowest in the high-elevation
   lakes for both strains. Activity rate and growth rate were highest at
   high elevation, but growing season survival did not differ between
   strains or between environments. Hence, we did not observe a trade-off
   between growth and predation risk related to foraging rate. Growth rate
   also differed significantly between the strains across both
   environments, which suggests that growth rate is involved in local
   adaptation. There was not, however, a difference between strains or
   between environments in energy storage. Hence, we did not observe a
   trade-off between growth and storage. Our findings suggest that
   intrinsic metabolic rate, which affects a trade-off between growth rate
   and overwinter survival, may influence local adaptation in organisms
   that experience particularly harsh winter conditions (e.g., extended
   periods trapped beneath the ice in high-elevation lakes) in some parts

Abstract = {{Zooplankton inhabiting deep, oligotrophic, tropical lakes must cope with
   scenarios where the combination of resource limitation, high
   visual-predation risk, UV-induced damage and seasonal development of
   anoxic waters, entail particular challenges for organisms, uncommon in
   temperate environments. We assessed the diel vertical
   migrationDVM(UV/predation-avoidance strategy), numerical response, and
   starvation resistance (physiological strategies to cope with food
   scarcity) of the copepod Leptodiaptomus garciai and the rotifers
   Hexarthra jenkinae and Brachionus sp. Mexico, which constitute the
   zooplankton assemblage of Alchichica, a high-altitude, deep,
   oligotrophic, hyposaline, warm-monomictic lake located in Mexico. L.
   garciai followed the normal pattern of DVM in all seasons; with
   organisms concentrated approximate to 20 m deeper than the depth of 1\%
   photosynthetically active radiation at mid-day, with evasion from the
   planktivore Poblana alchichica as the most probable driver. However,
   copepods could not evade the euphotic zone owing to the anoxic
   conditions of the hypolimnion during the well-established stratification
   period. Rotifers did not migrate vertically. The dominance of copepods
   throughout the year can be explained by their low food threshold, high
   proportion of usable reserves and the lowest rate of mass loss at food
   deprivation. Contrastingly, rotifers are scarce and intermittent due to
   frequent resource limitation and because they lose mass at higher rates.
   However, they are able to suddenly increase due to their high growth
   rates. We demonstrated that the interaction between environmental
   constraints and the specific combinations of traits can explain
   zooplankton structure in the lake. This study enlightens the necessity
   to improve current limnological models with data from tropical lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring environmental factors shape developmental
   trajectories to produce variable phenotypes. Such developmental
   phenotypic plasticity can have important effects on fitness, and has
   been demonstrated for numerous behavioral and morphological traits.
   However, surprisingly few studies have examined developmental plasticity
   of the nervous system in response to naturally occurring environmental
   variation, despite accumulating evidence for neuroplasticity in a
   variety of organisms. Here, we asked whether the brain is
   developmentally plastic by exposing larval amphibians to natural and
   anthropogenic factors. Leopard frog tadpoles were exposed to predator
   cues, reduced food availability, or sublethal concentrations of the
   pesticide chlorpyrifos in semi-natural enclosures. Mass, growth,
   survival, activity, larval period, external morphology, brain mass, and
   brain morphology were measured in tadpoles and after metamorphosis.
   Tadpoles in the experimental treatments had lower masses than controls,
   although developmental rates and survival were similar. Tadpoles exposed
   to predator cues or a high dose of chlorpyrifos had altered body shapes
   compared to controls. In addition, brains from tadpoles exposed to
   predator cues or a low dose of chlorpyrifos were narrower and shorter in
   several dimensions compared to control tadpoles and tadpoles with low
   food availability. Interestingly, the changes in brain morphology
   present at the tadpole stage did not persist in the metamorphs. Our
   results show that brain morphology is a developmentally plastic trait
   that is responsive to ecologically relevant natural and anthropogenic
   factors. Whether these effects on brain morphology are linked to
   performance or fitness is unknown.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{123-132}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animals can insure themselves against the risk of starvation associated
   with unpredictable food availability by storing energy reserves or
   gathering information about alternative food sources. The former
   strategy carries costs in terms of mass-dependent predation risk, while
   the latter trades off against foraging for food; both trade-offs may be
   influenced by an individual's developmental history. Here, we consider a
   possible role of early developmental experience in inducing different
   mass regulation and foraging strategies in European starlings. We
   measured the body mass, body condition, foraging effort, food
   consumption and contrafreeloading (foraging for food hidden in sand when
   equivalent food is freely available) of adult birds (>= 10 months old)
   that had previously undergone a subtle early life manipulation of food
   competition (cross-fostering into the highest or lowest ranks in the
   brood size hierarchy when 2 - 12 days of age). We found that
   developmentally disadvantaged birds were fatter in adulthood and
   differed in foraging behaviour compared with their advantaged siblings.
   Disadvantaged birds were hyperphagic compared with advantaged birds, but
   only following a period of food deprivation, and also spent more time
   contrafreeloading. Advantaged birds experienced a trade-off between
   foraging success and time spent contrafreeloading, whereas disadvantaged
   birds faced no such trade-off, owing to their greater foraging
   efficiency. Thus, developmentally disadvantaged birds appeared to retain
   a phenotypic memory of increased nestling food competition, employing
   both energy storage and information gathering insurance strategies to a
   greater extent than their advantaged siblings. Our results suggest that
   subtle early life disadvantage in the form of psychosocial stress and/or
   food insecurity can leave a lasting legacy on foraging behaviour and
   mass regulation even in the absence of food insufficiency during
   development or adulthood. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{ObjectiveEvidence associates anorexia nervosa (AN) with epigenetic
   alterations that could contribute to illness risk or entrenchment. We
   investigated the extent to which AN is associated with a distinct
   methylation profile compared to that seen in normal-eater women.
   MethodGenome-wide methylation profiles, obtained using DNA from whole
   blood, were determined in 29 women currently ill with AN (10 with
   AN-restrictive type, 19 with AN-binge/purge type) and 15 normal-weight,
   normal-eater control women, using 450 K Illumina bead arrays.
   ResultsRegardless of type, AN patients showed higher and less-variable
   global methylation patterns than controls. False Discovery Rate
   corrected comparisons identified 14 probes that were hypermethylated in
   women with AN relative to levels obtained in normal-eater controls,
   representing genes thought to be associated with histone acetylation,
   RNA modification, cholesterol storage and lipid transport, and dopamine
   and glutamate signaling. Age of onset was significantly associated with
   differential methylation in gene pathways involved in development of the
   brain and spinal cord, while chronicity of illness was significantly
   linked to differential methylation in pathways involved with
   synaptogenesis, neurocognitive deficits, anxiety, altered social
   functioning, and bowel, kidney, liver and immune function.
   DiscussionAlthough pre-existing differences cannot be ruled out, our
   findings are consistent with the idea of secondary alterations in
   methylation at genomic regions pertaining to social-emotional
   impairments and physical sequelae that are commonly seen in AN patients.
   Further investigation is needed to establish the clinical relevance of
   the affected genes in AN, and, importantly, reversibility of effects

   their unique needs, low access to credible information and nutrition
   professionals, and misinformation in the media and marketplace
   specifically targeting athletes. Physicians and other health
   professionals have an opportunity to communicate nutrition facts and
   make evidence-based recommendations about healthy eating in the setting
   of their ongoing interactions with adolescent athletes and their
   families. The purpose of this review is to describe the nutritional
   needs of adolescents participating in sport and highlight the potential
   for nutritional risk. Endorsed by professional organizations, our
   recommendations emphasize a balanced eating pattern that includes a wide
   variety of fresh, minimally processed whole foods. Our approach is to
   empower and teach adolescents to take responsibility for planning,
   preparing, and providing themselves consistent access to foods and
   fluids that deliver nutrients needed for proper fueling and recovery.
   Specific talking points that health professionals can use in brief
   interactions with patients and families are provided to endorse key
   behavioral strategies that young athletes can adopt to achieve peak
   athletic performance and optimal nutritional status.}},

Abstract = {{The predicted increase of the frequency and intensity of wildfires as a
   result of climate change could have a devastating impact on many species
   and ecosystems. However, the particular physiological and behavioural
   adaptions of animals to survive fires are poorly understood. We aimed to
   provide the first quantitative data on physiological and behavioural
   mechanisms used by a small heterothermic marsupial mammal, the
   fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), that may be crucial for
   survival during and immediately after a fire. Specifically, we aimed to
   determine (i) whether captive torpid animals are able to respond to fire
   stimuli and (ii) which energy saving mechanisms are used in response to
   fires. The initial response of torpid dunnarts to smoke exposure was to
   arouse immediately and therefore express shorter and shallower torpor
   bouts. Dunnarts also increased activity after smoke exposure when food
   was provided, but not when food was withheld. A charcoal/ash substrate,
   imitating post-fire conditions, resulted in a decrease in torpor use and
   activity, but only when food was available. Our novel data suggests that
   heterothermic mammals are able to respond to fire stimuli, such as
   smoke, to arouse from torpor as an initial response to fire and adjust
   torpor use and activity levels according to food availability modulated
   by fire cues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Long-distance migratory animals typically stop-over between migratory
   movements to rest and refuel. In species lacking stopover site fidelity,
   including most songbirds, timely arrival to breeding areas with
   sufficient energy stores for reproduction requires that migrants rapidly
   locate suitable stopover habitat in unfamiliar landscapes. Few studies
   have examined movement ecology in such species during stopover, and even
   fewer have addressed how these migrants adjust movement behaviors in
   response to encountering preferred or non-preferred habitats. We
   experimentally translocated spring transient Northern Waterthrushes
   (Parkesia noveboracensis) to preferred (bottomland) and non-preferred
   (upland) forest habitats and characterized subsequent fine-scale
   movements and stopover duration using radiotelemetry. Minimum stopover
   duration averaged 4.1 days and was 1.5 days longer in
   bottomland-released birds than in upland-released birds. Minimum
   stopover duration decreased by 1.4 days per week over the spring
   migratory period. For upland-released and bottomland-released birds,
   respectively, maximum distance moved from the release point was 635 +/-
   58 m and 326 +/- 51 m on the day of the release and 773 +/- 109 m and
   504 +/- 83 m on the following day. Upland-released individuals traveled
   nearly twice as far from the release point on day 1 as
   bottomland-released birds. Upon reaching bottomland habitats within 2.0
   +/- 0.3 h of release, subsequent distance moved on day 1 by
   upland-released birds was similar to that of bottomland-released birds.
   Cumulatively, these results indicate that initial exploratory movements
   were facultative and habitat dependent and that waterthrushes can
   successfully locate suitable stopover habitats in a heterogeneous
   landscape at the spatial scales we investigated.}},

Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Innovative behaviour may allow animals to cope with changes in their
   environment. Innovative propensities are known to vary widely both
   between and within species, and a growing body of research has begun to
   examine the factors that drive individuals to innovate. Evidence
   suggests that individuals are commonly driven to innovate by necessity;
   for instance by hunger or because they are physically unable to
   outcompete others for access to resources. However, it is not known
   whether the factors that drive individuals to innovate are stable across
   contexts. We examined contextual variation in the drivers of innovation
   in rock pool prawns (Palaemon spp), invertebrates that face widely
   fluctuating environments and may, through the actions of tides and
   waves, find themselves isolated or in groups. Using two novel foraging
   tasks, we examined the effects of body size and hunger in prawns tested
   in solitary and group contexts. When tested alone, small prawns were
   significantly more likely to succeed in a spatial task, and faster to
   reach the food in a manipulation task, while hunger state had no effect.
   In contrast, size had no effect when prawns were tested in groups, but
   food-deprived individuals were disproportionately likely to innovate in
   both tasks. We suggest that contextual variation in the drivers of
   innovation is likely to be common in animals living in variable
   environments, and may best be understood by considering variation in the
   perception of relative risks and rewards under different conditions.}},

Title = {{Incidental rewarding cues influence eeconomic decisions in people with
   obesity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that obesity is linked to prominent alterations
   in learning and decision-making. This general difference may also
   underlie the preference for immediately consumable, highly palatable but
   unhealthy and high calorie foods. Such poor food-related inter-temporal
   decision-making can explain weight gain; however, it is not yet clear
   whether this deficit can be generalized to other domains of
   inter-temporal decision-making, for example financial decisions.
   Further, little is known about the stability of decision making behavior
   in obesity, especially in the presence of rewarding cues. To answer
   these questions, obese and lean participants (n = 52) completed two
   sessions of a novel priming paradigm including a computerized monetary
   delay discounting task. In the first session, general differences
   between groups in financial delay discounting were measured. In the
   second session, we tested the general stability of discount rates.
   Additionally, participants were primed by affective visual cues of
   different contextual categories before making financial decisions. We
   found that the obese group showed stronger discounting of future
   monetary rewards than the lean group, but groups did not differ in their
   general stability between sessions nor in their sensitivity toward
   changes in reward magnitude. In the obese group, a fast decrease of
   subjective value over time was directly related to a higher tendency for
   opportunistic eating. Obese in contrast to lean people were primed by
   the affective cues, showing a sex specific pattern of priming direction.
   Our findings demonstrate that environments rich of cues, aiming at
   inducing unhealthy consumer decisions, can be highly detrimental for
   obese people. It also underscores that obesity is not merely a medical
   condition but has a strong cognitive component, meaning that current
   dietary and medical treatment strategies may fall too short.}},

   gain during infancy (The Baby Milk Trial): study protocol for a
   randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infancy is a period of rapid growth and habit formation and
   hence could be a critical period for obesity prevention. Excess weight
   gain during infancy is associated with later obesity and formula-fed
   babies are more likely to gain excess weight compared to breastfed
   babies. The primary trial outcome is a change in the weight standard
   deviation score from birth to 1 year.
   Methods/Design: We will recruit 650 to 700 parents who introduce
   formula-milk feeds within 14 weeks of their baby's birth to a single
   (assessor) blind, parallel group, individually randomised controlled
   trial. The focus of the intervention is the caregiver (usually the
   mother), and the focus of the primary outcome is the infant. The
   intervention group will receive the behavioural intervention, which aims
   to reduce formula-milk intake, promote responsive feeding and healthy
   weaning, and prevent excessive weight gain during infancy. The
   intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and action planning
   ('implementation intentions'). It consists of three components: (1) a
   motivational component to strengthen parents' motivation to follow the
   Baby Milk feeding guidelines, (2) an action planning component to help
   translate motivation into action, and (3) a coping planning component to
   help parents deal with difficult situations. It will be delivered by
   trained facilitators (research nurses) over 6 months through three
   face-to-face contacts, two telephone contacts and written materials. The
   control group will have the same number of contacts with facilitators,
   and general issues about feeding will be discussed. Anthropometric
   outcomes will be measured by trained research staff, blind to group
   allocation, at baseline, 6 months and 12 months following standard
   operating procedures. Validated questionnaires will assess milk intake,
   temperament, appetite, sleep, maternal quality of life and maternal
   psychological factors. A 4-day food diary will be completed at 8 months.
   Discussion: The results of the trial will help to inform infant feeding
   guidelines and to understand the links between infant feeding,
   behaviour, appetite and growth.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of growth to nutritional status is an important adaptive
   response of living organisms to their environment. For this ability,
   animals have evolved various strategies, including endocrine systems
   that respond to changing nutritional conditions. In animals, nutritional
   information is mostly perceived by peripheral organs, such as the
   digestive tract and adipose tissues, and is subsequently transmitted to
   other peripheral organs or the brain, which integrates the incoming
   signals and orchestrates physiological and behavioral responses. In
   Drosophila melanogaster, adipose tissue, known as the fat body,
   functions as an endocrine organ that communicates with the brain. This
   fat body-brain axis coordinates growth with nutritional status by
   regulating the secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps)
   from the brain. However, the molecular nature of the fat body-brain axis
   remains to be elucidated. We recently demonstrated that a small peptide,
   CCHamide-2 (CCHa2), expressed in the fat body and gut, directly
   stimulates its receptor (CCHa2-R) in the brain, leading to Dilp
   production. Notably, the expression of CCHa2 is sensitive to the
   presence of nutrients, particularly sugars. Our results, together with
   the results of previous studies, show that signaling between peripheral
   organs and the brain is a conserved strategy that couples nutritional
   availability to organismal physiology.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{475-484}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{How trophic resources are managed is a key factor in our understanding
   of the success of invasive species. In amphibians that usually occupy
   ephemeral ponds, the capacity to acquire resources and food selection
   are especially important because as a pond dries, the larval density
   increases and food resources are limited. Abundant and high-quality food
   can increase the final size and reduce the duration of development of
   amphibians. The aim of this work was to assess the trophic traits of
   tadpoles of the invasive (originally North African) anuran Discoglossus
   pictus compared to those of native European Epidalea calamita tadpoles
   under laboratory conditions. Food of two different levels of quality was
   supplied, and the feeding activity and food preference of the two
   species were analysed alone and in co-occurrence. D. pictus was capable
   of modifying its behaviour and food preferences; while E. calamita
   displayed much milder differences between treatments. Both alone and in
   co-occurrence with the native species, the invasive tadpoles obtained
   higher feeding activity values and showed a stronger preference for
   high-quality food. Additionally, when high densities of the two species
   shared food resources, the feeding activity results indicated potential
   displacement of the native tadpoles to low-quality resources. D. pictus
   thus presents trophic traits that are favourable for invasion and could
   limit the fitness of E. calamita when resources are limited or there is
   a risk of pond desiccation.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the influence of diet on larval
   proactive-reactive behavioural dimension of stress coping style
   responses. The present study evaluated the influence of using different
   vegetables oils (Linseed; Soybean; Olive) and fish oil (Cod liver) for
   Artemia metanauplii nutritional enrichment on the proactive-reactive
   behavioural responses of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis)
   post-larvae (40 days post hatch). Forty-two Senegalese sole larvae from
   each of the four replicate tanks per treatment were tested. Two tests
   were performed: a new environment individual-based test, which evaluate
   the larvae latency time to move, total activity time and total distance
   moved; and a risk group-based test, which consisted in evaluating the
   larval capacity to cross from a ``comfort{''} zone to a ``risk{''} zone.
   In the group-based test, proactive, intermediate and reactive
   individuals were identified depending on the time taken to cross between
   two zones. Larvae fed with Artemia metanauplii enriched with the cod
   liver oil emulsion were significantly (P=0.01) larger and in the
   individual-based test presented significantly higher total activity time
   (P=0.08) and total distance moved (P=0.01) than larvae from the other
   dietary treatments. No significant correlations (P>0.05) were observed
   between larvae total length and latency time to move, total activity
   time or total distance moved across all treatments or within any dietary
   treatment. In the group-based test, fish fed with Artemia enriched with
   the cod liver oil emulsion presented a significantly higher proportion
   of proactive larvae (P=0.02) and the lower proportion of reactive
   larvae. The present study showed for the first time that (i) Senegalese
   sole presented a defined proactive-reactive behaviour from early
   ontogenesis and (ii) dietary fatty acid composition significantly
   influenced the proactive-reactive behavioural dimension of stress coping
   style of sole larvae. The current study has practical implications that
   open the possibility to produce organisms that have behavioural styles
   that could ultimately result in improved aquaculture productivity. (C)

Abstract = {{Background. In cross-sectional studies, cocaine users generally display
   elevated levels of self-reported and cognitive impulsivity. To what
   extent these impairments are stable upsilon. variable markers of cocaine
   use disorder, and, thus, are preexisting or drug-induced, has not yet
   been systematically investigated.
   Method. We conducted a longitudinal study with cocaine users who changed
   or maintained their consumption intensity, measuring self-reported
   impulsivity with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and cognitive
   impulsivity with the Rapid Visual Processing task (RVP), Iowa Gambling
   task (IGT), and Delay Discounting task (DD) at baseline and at 1-year
   follow-up. We assessed 48 psychostimulant-naive controls and 19 cocaine
   users with decreased, 19 users with increased, and 19 users with
   unchanged cocaine intake after 1 year as confirmed by hair analysis.
   Results. Results of linear multilevel modelling showed significant group
   x time interactions for the BIS-11 total score and the IGT total card
   ratio. Increasers showed a trend for elevated scores, whereas decreasers
   exhibited reduced self-reported impulsivity scores within 1 year.
   Surprisingly, increasers' IGT performance was improved after 1 year,
   whereas decreasers' performance deteriorated. By contrast, neither RVP
   response bias B{''} nor DD total score showed substantial group x time
   interactions. Importantly, BIS-11 and DD revealed strong test-retest
   reliabilities.
   Conclusion. Self-reported impulsivity (BIS-11) and decision-making
   impulsivity (IGT) covary with changing cocaine use, whereas response
   bias and delay discounting remain largely unaffected. Thus,
   self-reported impulsivity and gambling decision-making were strongly
   state-dependent in a stimulant-using population and may be suitable to
   monitor treatment success, whereas delay of gratification was confirmed
   as a potential endophenotype of stimulant addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal depression is a known risk factor for poor outcomes for
   children. Pathways to these poor outcomes relate to reduced maternal
   responsiveness or sensitivity to the child. Impaired responsiveness
   potentially impacts the feeding relationship and thus may be a risk
   factor for inappropriate feeding practices. The aim of this study was to
   examine the longitudinal relationships between self-reported maternal
   post-natal depressive symptoms at child age 4 months and feeding
   practices at child age 2 years in a community sample. Participants were
   Australian first-time mothers allocated to the control group of the
   NOURISH randomized controlled trial when infants were 4 months old.
   Complete data from 211 mothers (of 346 allocated) followed up when their
   children were 2 years of age (51\% girls) were available for analysis.
   The relationship between Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
   score (child age 4 months) and child feeding practices (child age 2
   years) was tested using hierarchical linear regression analysis adjusted
   for maternal and child characteristics. Higher EPDS score was associated
   with less responsive feeding practices at child age 2 years: greater

   provides evidence for the proposed link between maternal post-natal

   findings suggest that the provision of support to mothers experiencing
   some levels of depressive symptomatology in the early post-natal period
   may improve responsiveness in the child feeding relationship.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behaviour of omnivores is often difficult to predict and,
   thus, our understanding of their role in ecosystems is limited. The
   majority of our knowledge about omnivores comes from studies examining

   different conditions. The potential effect of intraspecific variation in
   food quality on omnivore foraging behaviour has received less attention.
   To enhance our understanding of the foraging behaviour of omnivores, we

   behaviour and activity budget of an omnivorous insect, Dicyphus hesperus
   Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae), in arenas where a single species of plant
   food and a single species of prey food were provided at varying levels
   of quality based on nitrogen content. The activity budget of D. hesperus
   was not balanced; it was dominated by prey feeding, followed by plant
   feeding and probing. Foraging behaviour of D. hesperus was affected by
   the interaction of prey and plant quality, such that optimal foraging
   theory could predict its foraging behaviour in the presence of prey
   reared on high N-fertilized tomato plants, but not in the presence of
   low N-fertilized tomato plants. Neither prey quality nor plant quality
   affected the rate of prey consumption or the handling time of prey by D.
   hesperus during the observation period. Our results highlight the
   complexity of omnivore feeding behaviour and indicate that feeding
   decisions are not based only on the prey or plant species provided, but
   also on the quality of those resources. (C) 2015 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Differences in food availability and predation risk can influence how
   herbivores use landscapes. As a result, trade-offs between costs and
   benefits can influence habitat and patch selection. To determine how
   oribi antelope, Ourebia ourebi, weigh up costs and benefits when making
   habitat and patch level foraging decisions, we measured giving-up
   densities in artificial patches. First, we determined large-scale
   habitat use, and then explored how different variables explained patch
   use within habitats. When the availability of food within patches across
   the different habitats was equal, oribi preferred to feed in short and
   tall grasslands and avoided woodlands. Furthermore, the avoidance of
   woodlands extended into the surrounding grasslands, resulting in oribi
   feeding less intensively in grassland areas within 15 m of the
   woodlands. Within the safe grassland habitats, oribi preferred to feed
   in patches close to tall grass (i.e. escape cover), and where they could
   see beyond 2 m. These results suggest that oribi select habitats and
   patches in relation to perceived predation risk (i.e. predation costs
   outweigh potential food intake benefits). However, when we increased
   food availability within woodlands, oribi increased their large-scale
   risk-taking behaviour and fed in these woodlands. Furthermore, this
   increased risk taking extended to small-scale foraging decisions whereby
   an increase in food availability within woodlands caused oribi to
   increase their relative usage of patches that had sight lines as well as
   patches that were closer to potential ambush sites. Ultimately, these
   results highlight how changes in food availability can determine the
   degree to which herbivores are willing to increase their risk-taking
   behaviour, and how these changes can affect overall landscape use. (C)

   The study sample included 1174 mothers participating in the Special
   Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)
   within 1 year postpartum, including an augment sample of mothers who
   delivered preterm. Maternal sociodemographic traits, prepregnancy
   health-related characteristics and behaviors, and birth outcomes were
   collected by telephone survey. Odds ratios for associations between risk
   factors and preterm birth were estimated by logistic regression with
   sampling weights. Effect measure modification of any association by
   maternal nativity was also assessed using interaction terms.
   After adjustment for confounding, significant prepregnancy risk factors
   for preterm birth included maternal age a parts per thousand yen35 years
   (OR 2.00; 95 \% CI 1.04, 3.84) compared to age 18-24 years, and
   experience of a financially stressful life event among U.S.-born, but

   prevalence of preterm birth was 15.1 \% and did not significantly differ
   by maternal nativity (P = 0.19).
   Further investigation with large, prospective studies is needed to
   better understand the risk factors for and disparities in preterm birth
   among the growing Hispanic population in the U.S. so that women who are

   changes in vegetable intake and the use of behavioral strategies to
   increase dietary fiber and decrease dietary fat intake. Participant
   satisfaction was high, and fidelity was achieved; 87.5\% of families

   variety of ways, some mediated through the parent's phenotype. Sometimes
   the organism copes in suboptimal conditions trading off reproductive
   success against survival. Whatever the adaptedness of the phenotype,

   INVESTIGATION OF THE PERSONALITY}},

Pages = {{167-169}},

Abstract = {{Forensic investigation of the personality of the interrogated is
   connected with the need which ensures the effectiveness of preparation
   and the achievement of purposes of the interrogation, but, at the same
   time, it involves a number of difficulties which appear in the process
   of its implementation. The data available to the psychological, forensic
   and a number of other human sciences allow to assert with confidence
   that a personality obeys certain laws and knowing these laws allows a
   person to get to know this personality forming a system out of this
   information. It is well known from biology and physiology that the
   existence of any living organism needs energy. Any energy is exhausted,
   being consumed and spent on the maintenance of a living organism. To
   compensate for the spent energy reserves it is necessary to consume.
   Consumption of energy for living organisms is associated with the
   consumption of organic substances which is known to all as the nutrition
   process. A human being is a living organism to whom the designated
   pattern is logically extended. Since birth a person acquires skills to
   survive in the environment since it is dictated by the need for
   survival. The mechanism that allows a person to balance the available
   opportunities and potential environmental factors is the mechanism of
   homeostasis. The manifestation of the mechanism of homeostasis in life
   of a human being is caused by a number of the following laws: firstly,
   the existence of a living organism without energy is impossible;
   secondly, the energy is spent on maintaining the existence of a living
   organism; thirdly, lack of energy leads to problems and health disorders
   and, subsequently, to the irreversible loss of the viability of a living
   organism; fourthly, replenishing energy requires exploration, production
   and consumption of resources which are capable of restoring this energy;
   fifthly, in the conditions of resources being finite, the passage of
   time and continuous flow of energy (consumption of energy is constant,
   the only question is the flow rate), it is required to optimize the
   process of exploration, production and consumption of resources which
   are the sources of energy needed for the existence of a living organism.
   From the moment of birth and in the further development process a person
   has a genetic predisposition to a certain set of a particular type of
   activity. In this regard it is clear that homeostasis is reflected in
   the life scenarios of the interrogated as the most familiar way of
   interacting with the environment and people in solving the problems of
   their existence, viability and survival by achieving integrity,
   stability and satisfaction of physiological and psychological needs.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesCross-species comparisons show that high extrinsic mortality
   favors the evolution of faster life histories. There is interest in
   applying this principle to human life history plasticity, based on the
   idea that psychosocial stressors that correlate with extrinsic mortality
   accelerate reproductive pace. Most prior studies have been conducted in
   settings in which psychosocial stressors co-occur with the
   maturation-accelerating influence of nutritional abundance.
   Materials and MethodsWe evaluate cues of local mortality (sibling death)
   or low parental investment (paternal instability; maternal absence) and
   energetic measures during development as predictors of life history
   scheduling among males (n=754) in a Philippine population with marginal
   developmental nutritional.
   ResultsMales who had more favorable nutritional status during childhood,
   as reflected in linear growth, skinfold thickness, and caloric intake,
   were more maturationally advanced in adolescence (all P<0.05). Taller
   stature and higher caloric intake during childhood also predicted
   earlier ages at first sex (both P<0.01), which persisted after
   controlling for the effect of nutrition on pubertal maturation. While
   psychosocial stressors did not predict accelerated maturation, males who
   as children grew up with an unstable paternal presence had sex earlier
   (P<0.05) and tended to become fathers sooner than those with a stable
   fatherly presence. Those who had a sibling die became fathers sooner
   than those who did not (P<0.05).
   DiscussionOur findings point to important energetic constraints on the
   onset of reproductive maturity, while psychosocial stressors accelerate
   entry to parenthood, which may be comparatively more socially, rather
   than biologically, constrained. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:175-184, 2015.

Abstract = {{Findings showing that neonatal lesions of the forebrain dopaminergic
   system in rodents lead to juvenile locomotor hyperactivity and learning
   deficits have been taken as evidence of face validity for the attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the core cognitive and
   physiological intermediate phenotypes underlying this rodent syndrome
   remain unknown. Here we show that early postnatal dopaminergic lesions
   cause long-lasting deficits in exploitation of shelter, social and
   nutritional resources, and an imbalanced exploratory behavior, where
   nondirected local exploration is exacerbated, whereas sophisticated
   search behaviors involving sequences of goal directed actions are
   degraded. Importantly, some behavioral deficits do not diminish after
   adolescence but instead worsen or mutate, particularly those related to
   the exploration of wide and spatially complex environments. The in vivo
   electrophysiological recordings and morphological reconstructions of
   striatal medium spiny neurons reveal corticostriatal alterations
   associated to the behavioral phenotype. More specifically, an
   attenuation of corticostriatal functional connectivity, affecting medial
   prefrontal inputs more markedly than cingulate and motor inputs, is
   accompanied by a contraction of the dendritic arbor of striatal
   projection neurons in this animal model. Thus, dopaminergic neurons are
   essential during postnatal development for the functional and structural
   maturation of corticostriatal connections. From a bottom-up viewpoint,
   our findings suggest that neuropsychiatric conditions presumably linked
   to developmental alterations of the dopaminergic system should be
   evaluated for deficits in foraging decision making, alterations in the
   recruitment of corticostriatal circuits during foraging tasks, and
   structural disorganization of the frontostriatal connections.}},

Abstract = {{Body weight and the levels of stored body fat have fitness consequences.
   Greater levels of fat may provide protection against catastrophic
   failures in the food supply, but they may also increase the risk of
   predation. Animals may therefore regulate their fatness according to
   their perceived risks of predation and starvation: the starvation
   predation trade-off model. We tested the predictions of this model in
   wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) by experimentally manipulating predation
   risk and starvation risk. We predicted that under increased predation
   risk individuals would lose weight and under increased starvation risk
   they would gain it. We simulated increased predation risk by playing the
   calls made by predatory birds (owls: Tyto alba and Bubo bubo) to the
   mice. Control groups included exposure to calls of a non-predatory bird
   (blackbird: Turdus merula) or silence. Mice exposed to owl calls at
   night lost weight relative to the silence group, mediated via reduced
   food intake, but exposure to owl calls in the day had no significant
   effect. Exposure to blackbird calls at night also resulted in weight
   loss, but blackbird calls in the day had no effect. Mice seemed to have
   a generalised response to bird calls at night irrespective of their
   actual source. This could be because in the wild any bird calling at
   night will be a predation risk, and any bird calling in the day would
   not be, because at that time the mice would-normally be resting, and
   hence not exposed to avian predators. Consequently, mice have not
   evolved to distinguish different types of call but only to respond to
   the time of day that they occur. Mice exposed to stochastic 24 h
   starvation events altered their behaviour (reduced activity) during the
   refeeding days that followed the deprivation periods to regain the lost
   mass. However, they only marginally elevated their food intake and
   consequently had reduced body weight/fat storage compared to that of the
   control unstarved group. This response may have been constrained by
   physiological factors (alimentary tract absorption capacity) or
   behavioural factors (perceived risk of predation). Overall the responses
   of the mice appeared to provide limited support for the starvation
   predation trade-off model, and suggest that wood mice are much more
   sensitive to predation risk than they are to starvation risk. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The field of personality psychology offers a wealth of robust empirical
   research and a successful descriptive taxonomy, but neither explains the
   origins of the structure of human personality nor elaborates a
   generative framework for predicting the specific conditions that evoke
   the development of distinct personality traits. Exploration of
   traditional personality constructs within an evolutionary adaptive
   individual differences framework may help fill this explanatory gap.
   Personality traits exhibit functional features and patterns of variation
   expected from psychological adaptations designed to solve survival- and
   reproduction-related challenges recurrently faced during our species'
   evolutionary history. Condition-dependent evolutionary models of
   personality have been proposed for decades, but only recently have begun
   to see empirical investigation. These models posit that species-typical
   psychological mechanisms take as input cues from the individual's
   phenotype that would have been ancestrally linked to differential
   cost-benefit tradeoffs of alternative personality strategies, and
   produce as output personality trait levels with the greatest
   probabilistic net benefit for the individual. This paper elaborates a
   more nuanced conceptual framework that builds on earlier
   conceptualizations of condition-dependent traits to yield new and
   untested hypotheses about personality trait variation and covariation.
   It then describes clear future research directions for empirically
   investigating these readily testable hypotheses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid hormonal peptide that is intimately related
   to the regulation of food in take and body weight. Once secreted,
   ghrelin binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a, the only
   known receptor for ghrelin and is capable of activating a number of
   signaling cascades, ultimately resulting in an increase in food intake
   and adiposity. Because ghrelin has been linked to overeating and the
   development of obesity, a number of pharmacological interventions have
   been generated in order to interfere with either the activation of
   ghrelin or interrupting ghrelin signaling as a means to reducing
   appetite and decrease weight gain. Here, we present a novel peptide,
   CF801, capable of reducing circulating acylated ghrelin levels and
   subsequent body weight gain and adiposity. Tot his end, we show that IP
   administration of CF801 is sufficient to reduce circulating plasma
   acylated ghrelin levels. Acutely, intraperitoneal injections of CF801
   resulted in decreased rebound feeding after an overnight fast. When
   delivered chronically, they decreased weight gain and adiposity without
   affecting caloric intake. CF801, however, did cause a change in diet
   preference, decreasing preference for a high-fat diet and increasing
   preference for regular chow diet. Given the complexity of ghrelin
   receptor function, we propose that CF801, along with other compounds
   that regulate ghrelin secretion, may prove to be a beneficial tool in
   the study of the ghrelin system, and potential targets for ghrelin-based
   obesity treatments without altering the function of ghrelin receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Hunger is a complex motivational state that drives multiple behaviors.
   The sensation of hunger is caused by an imbalance between energy intake
   and expenditure. One immediate response to hunger is increased food
   consumption. Hunger also modulates behaviors related to food seeking
   such as increased locomotion and enhanced sensory sensitivity in both
   insects {[}1-5] and vertebrates {[}6, 7]. In addition, hunger can
   promote the expression of food-associated memory {[}8, 9]. Although
   progress is being made {[}10], how hunger is represented in the brain
   and how it coordinates these behavioral responses is not fully
   understood in any system. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to
   identify neurons encoding hunger. We found a small group of neurons
   that, when activated, induced a fed fly to eat as though it were
   starved, suggesting that these neurons are downstream of the metabolic
   regulation of hunger. Artificially activating these neurons also
   promotes appetitive memory performance in sated flies, indicating that
   these neurons are not simply feeding command neurons but likely play a
   more general role in encoding hunger. We determined that the neurons
   relevant for the feeding effect are serotonergic and project broadly
   within the brain, suggesting a possible mechanism for how various
   responses to hunger are coordinated. These findings extend our
   understanding of the neural circuitry that drives feeding and enable
   future exploration of how state influences neural activity within this
   circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Current fishing extraction methods often generate huge quantities of
   dead or dying biomass that is returned to the sea in the form of
   discards. This practice produces a readily available clumped resource
   for many scavengers such as seabirds, but in the face of declining
   stocks and via policy change, the amount of discards produced is set to
   decline in the future. To understand how discards have influenced
   seabird foraging in the past and how birds may respond to future change
   requires studies examining consistent individual foraging choices. There
   is increasing evidence that populations may be made up of generalist or
   specialist foragers and this is key to the population's ability to adapt
   to change. Here we test for consistent individual foraging behaviour of
   northern gannets Morus bassanus in relation to fishing vessels and
   examine consequences of scavenging behaviour in terms of foraging effort
   and body condition. Using a combination of bird-borne bio-logging
   devices (GPS and Time Depth Recorders) with high resolution GPS data
   acquired through vessel monitoring systems on fishing boats, we examined
   the overlap between birds and fisheries. We found that during repeat
   foraging trips in the same breeding season, gannets regularly foraged at
   fishing boats but there were also clear among individual differences in
   the extent of fisheries overlap. Furthermore, we show for the first time
   that these differences represent consistent strategies - individual
   differences in scavenging were highly repeatable across multiple trips
   within a period of several weeks. However, despite this finding, we
   found no differences in foraging effort or body condition between
   scavengers and non-scavengers. Moreover, scavenging strategy did not
   appear to influence diving behaviour or vary by sex. Scavenging on
   discards appears to be a strategy employed consistently by a subsection
   of the population and future work should examine whether these
   specialisations persist throughout and between years and what causes
   these individual differences, exploring possible demographic and fitness
   consequences in light of global changes to fish stocks and fisheries
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Stopover behavior of migrant birds is influenced by their energetic
   condition, but also by extrinsic factors, including weather conditions
   and habitat attributes such as vegetation structure, microclimates,
   predation pressure, competition, and food availability. Anthropogenic
   habitats may differ from natural habitats in these attributes, which
   could promote differing stopover behaviors for migrants in the two
   habitat types and affect overall habitat suitability. We used
   radio-telemetry to measure stopover behaviors of fall migrant
   yellow-rumped warblers Setophaga coronata in native riparian corridor
   woodlands (corridors) and anthropogenic woodlots (woodlots) in the
   Northern Prairie region. We measured stopover duration, movement rate,
   and temporary home range size for birds in both habitat types by
   attaching radio-transmitters and relocating birds to either corridor (n
   = 17) or woodlot (n = 16) study sites. We used AIC(C) to rank null,
   global, and reduced models, which included habitat type, energetic
   condition, habitat size, year, date, and movement rate (for stopover
   duration analyses only) as explanatory variables. Model rankings showed
   that habitat type was not included in any of the top models (Delta
   AIC(C) < 2) for movement behavior, temporary home range size, or
   stopover duration, which suggests similar functional habitat quality
   between the two habitat types. These data add similar behavioral
   responses for birds in the two habitat types to similar fattening rates
   and stress physiology, further confirming similar suitability of native
   and anthropogenic woodland habitats in this region as stopover habitat.
   We also applied logistic regression with a model selection approach,
   including cloud cover, tail wind component, temperature, and barometric
   pressure as independent variables, and departure decision as the
   dependent variable, to evaluate the effects of weather variables on
   departure. Model selection suggested that cloud cover is a prominent

   composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), energy intake, food reward
   and craving, and eating behaviour traits were assessed under controlled

   reported feeling lower control over food cravings. Further, they
   consumed more energy and exhibited greater wanting for high-fat food.
   The inverse pattern of characteristics was observed in those exhibiting

   poorly defined. However there is evidence from intervention studies

Abstract = {{The mystery surrounding how plant neurotoxins came to possess
   reinforcing properties is termed the paradox of drug reward. Here we
   propose a resolution to this paradox whereby dopamine - which has
   traditionally been viewed as a signal of reward - initially signaled
   aversion and encouraged escape. We suggest that after being consumed,
   plant neurotoxins such as nicotine activated an aversive dopaminergic
   pathway, thereby deterring predatory herbivores. Later evolutionary
   events - including the development of a GABAergic system capable of
   modulating dopaminergic activity - led to the ability to down-regulate
   and `control' this dopamine-based aversion. We speculate that this
   negative reinforcement system evolved so that animals could suppress
   aversive states such as hunger in order to attend to other internal
   drives (such as mating and shelter) that would result in improved
   organismal fitness. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, it has been recognized that in many animal
   species, individuals present consistent behavioral differences across
   time and/or contexts, thus defining personality traits. A general
   relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild
   populations, which raises the question as to how variation in
   personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating
   selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute
   to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild
   populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we
   investigated the relationship between individual personality differences
   and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a
   population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences
   considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated
   trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using
   capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a
   1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus
   ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found
   that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food
   availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability.
   Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to
   maintaining variation in boldness in the study population.}},

Abstract = {{Global change affects individual phenotypes and biotic interactions,

   larvae have a higher maximum predation rate than cold-acclimated ones,

   County, NY. The program aimed to facilitate lifestyle change and improve
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through weekly group nutrition
   education (60-90 min) and exercise (60 min) classes. We examined
   baseline characteristics of participants using simple descriptive
   statistics and evaluated program implementation and impact using the
   Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework. The curriculum, which drew from the social-ecological
   framework and motivational and cognitive behavioral strategies,
   consisted of 12 culturally and medically tailored modules with options
   for implementation as a 12- or 4-week program. Seven programs (four 12
   weeks and three 4 weeks in length, respectively) were implemented at
   five community site locations. Sixty-six cancer survivors and 17 cancer
   co-survivors (mean age 60.5 +/- 10.2 years) enrolled in one of the
   programs. Most participants were female (95.2 \%) minority (55.4 \%
   black, 26.5 \% Hispanic/Latino) breast cancer survivors (75.7 \%).
   Median program attendance was 62.5 \% and did not significantly differ
   by program length; however, 67.3 \% of participants achieved a parts per
   thousand yen60 \% attendance among the 12-week programs, compared to
   41.9 \% among the 4-week programs, and this difference was statistically
   significant (p = 0.02). Overall, participants reported significant
   pre/post improvements in perceived health as good/excellent (66.0 to
   75.5 \%; p = 0.001) and borderline significant decreases in perceived
   pain as moderate/severe (45.5 to 38.2 \%; p = 0.05). More than 90 \% of
   participants reported that the program helped them to achieve their
   short-term goals, motivated them to engage in healthier behaviors, and
   felt that the nutrition and exercise classes were relevant to their
   needs. These results indicate that a short-term lifestyle intervention
   program for adult cancer survivors was acceptable in our community and
   motivated cancer survivors to improve their HRQoL. The curriculum can be

Abstract = {{Daphnia lumholtzi is an exotic species of zooplankton that was first
   introduced in Texas, U.S.A., and has since spread across most of the
   areas in the country. Research has focussed on the importance of the
   production of morphological defences in response to predator exposure as
   a key explanation for the spread of this species. Very little is known
   about the influence of other common environmental stressors on the
   fitness of this species or the potential role for genetic variation in
   plasticity in the spread of this species. We assessed the effects of two
   common environmental stressors, invertebrate predator cues and
   increasing concentrations of cyanobacteria, on the life-history traits
   in D.lumholtzi. This study also included clones from three reservoirs in
   Texas to measure potential genetic variation in plasticity. We found
   that the expression of life-history traits depended strongly upon the
   combined effects of predator exposure and food quality. Increasing
   concentrations of cyanobacteria resulted in delayed maturation, slower
   growth, a smaller size at maturation, declines in clutch size and slower
   rate of population growth. Yet, such declines were much smaller in the
   presence of predator cues. Divergent responses observed were the size of
   defence traits; Daphnia reared in the absence of predator cues increased
   the size of spines as the concentrations of cyanobacteria increased,
   while the opposite pattern was observed in the presence of predator
   cues. This study also revealed extensive genetic variation in the
   magnitude and direction of phenotypic responses to predators and
   cyanobacteria. These latter results illustrate that significant clonal
   variation in plasticity may help promote the spread of this species.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is theorized
   to have temperamental precursors early in life. These are difficult to
   identify because many core features of ADHD, such as breakdowns in

   life. ADHD also involves emotional dysregulation, and these
   temperamental features appear earlier as well. Here, we report a first
   attempt to utilize indices of emotional regulation to identify
   ADHD-related liability in infancy.
   MethodsFifty women were recruited in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy,
   with overselection for high parental ADHD symptoms. Measures of maternal
   body mass index, nutrition, substance use, stress, and mood were
   examined during pregnancy as potential confounds. Offspring were
   evaluated at 6months of age using LABTAB procedures designed to elicit
   fear, anger, and regulatory behavior. Mothers completed the Infant
   Behavior Questionnaire about their child's temperament.
   ResultsAfter control for associated covariates, including maternal
   depression and prenatal stress, family history of ADHD was associated
   with measures of anger/irritability, including infant negative
   vocalizations during the arm restraint task (p=.004), and maternal
   ratings of infant distress to limitations (p=.036). In the regulation
   domain, familial ADHD was associated with less parent-oriented attention
   seeking during the still face procedure (p<.001), but this was not
   echoed in the maternal ratings of recovery from distress.
   ConclusionsAffective response at 6months of age may identify infants
   with familial history of ADHD, providing an early indicator of ADHD
   liability. These preliminary results provide a foundation for further
   studies and will be amplified by enlarging this cohort and following
   participants longitudinally to evaluate ADHD outcomes.}},

   examined how maternal feeding style and infant temperament independently
   and interactively predicted the age at which infants were introduced to

   collected when infants were 4 and 6 months of age. The timing of solid

   infants' hunger and satiety cues, and negatively correlated with
   mothers' pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), beliefs about feeding
   infants solid food prior to 6 months of age, and infants' temperamental
   motor reactivity. When controlling for maternal age, education,
   pre-pregnancy BMI, and milk feeding method at 4 months, the timing of
   solid food introduction was negatively predicted by mothers' beliefs

   for a bad start in life}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: An individual's fitness in part depends on the
   characteristics of the mate so that sexually attractive ornaments, as
   signals of quality, are used in mate choice. Often such ornaments
   develop already early in life and thus are affected by nutritional
   conditions experienced then. Individuals thus should benefit by
   compensating as soon as possible for poor initial development of
   ornaments, to be attractive already at sexual maturity. Here, we tested
   whether early nutritional stress affects the cheek patch size of male
   Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), which are important in mate choice,
   and whether a small cheek patch size early on is compensated at sexual
   maturation. Furthermore we tested whether exploration behaviour is
   affected by such a compensation, as shown for other compensatory growth
   trajectories.
   Results: Zebra finch males which were raised under poorer nutritional
   conditions initially expressed smaller cheek patches at day 50
   post-hatching but then compensated in cheek patch size already at 65
   days, i.e. when becoming sexually mature. Furthermore, compensatory
   growth in cheek patch during adolescence was negatively correlated with
   activity and exploration behaviour, measured in a novel environment.
   Conclusion: This compensation in cheek patch size benefits male
   attractiveness but also was related to less exploration behaviour, an
   established proxy for avian personality traits. We discuss the
   possibility that compensatory priorities exist so that not all deficits
   from a bad start are caught-up at the same time. Resource allocation to
   compensate for poorly expressed traits is likely to have evolved to
   optimise traits by the time they are most beneficial.}},

   wild great tit nestlings: implications for the development of
   personality}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Variation in early nutrition is known to play an important
   role in shaping the behavioural development of individuals. Parental
   prey selection may have long-lasting behavioural influences. In birds
   foraging on arthropods, for instance, the specific prey types, e.g.
   spiders and caterpillars, matter as they have different levels of
   taurine which may have an effect on personality development. Here we
   investigated how naturally occurring variation in the amounts of spiders
   and caterpillars, provisioned to nestlings at day 4 and 8 after
   hatching, is related to the response to handling stress in a wild
   passerine, the great tit (Parus major). Broods were cross-fostered in a
   split-brood design allowing us to separate maternal and genetic effects
   from early rearing effects. Adult provisioning behaviour was monitored
   on day four and day eight after hatching using video recordings.
   Individual nestlings were subjected to a handling stress test at an age
   of 14 days, which is a validated proxy for exploratory behaviour as an
   adult.
   Results: Variation in handling stress was mainly determined by the
   rearing environment. We show that, contrary to our predictions, not the
   amount of spider biomass, but the amount of caterpillar biomass
   delivered per nestling significantly affected individual performance in
   the stress test. Chicks provisioned with lower amounts of caterpillars
   exhibited a stronger stress response, reflecting faster exploratory
   behaviour later on in life, than individuals who received larger amounts
   of caterpillars.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that natural variation in parental
   behaviour in wild birds modulates the developmental trajectories of
   their offspring's personality via food provisioning. Since parental
   provisioning behaviour might also reflect the local environmental
   conditions, provisioning behaviour may influence how nestlings respond
   to these local environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lifestyle and health behaviours are strongly linked to
   non-communicable disease risk, but modifying them is challenging. There
   is an increasing recognition that adolescence is an important time for
   lifestyle and health behaviours to become embedded. Improving these
   behaviours in adolescents is important not only for their own health but
   also for that of their future children. LifeLab Southampton has been
   developed as a purpose-built classroom and laboratory in University
   Hospital Southampton. Secondary school students visit LifeLab to learn
   how childhood, adolescent and parental nutrition influences health,
   understand the impact of their lifestyle on their cardiovascular and
   metabolic health, and to inspire them with the excitement of research
   and future career possibilities in science. The LifeLab visit is part of
   a programme of work linked to the English National Curriculum. Pilot
   work has indicated that attitudes towards health can be changed by such
   LifeLab sessions.
   Methods/Design: A cluster randomised controlled trial is being conducted
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the LifeLab intervention, the primary
   outcome being a measurement of the change in nutrition, health and
   lifestyle literacy from before to after the LifeLab intervention. The
   LifeLab intervention comprises professional development for the teachers
   involved; preparatory lessons for the school students, delivered in
   school; a hands-on practical day at LifeLab, including a `Meet the
   Scientist' session; post-visit lessons delivered in school; and the
   opportunity to participate in the annual LifeLab Schools' Conference.
   This study aims to recruit approximately 2,500 secondary school students
   aged 13 to 14 years from 32 schools (the clusters) from Southampton and
   neighbouring areas. Participating schools will be randomised to control
   or intervention groups. The intervention will be run over two academic
   school years, with baseline questionnaire data collected from students
   at participating schools at the start of the academic year and follow-up
   questionnaire data collected approximately 12 months later.}},

   of the wintering Hooded Crane (Grus monacha)}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Food abundance and availability affect flock patterns of
   foraging birds. Cost and risk tradeoffs are especially critical for
   flocks of wintering waterbirds foraging in lake wetlands. Waterbirds
   losing suitable habitats face insufficient food supplies and high levels
   of disturbance, affecting their foraging activities. Our objective was
   to study the effects of food abundance and disturbances on flock size
   and the structure of Hooded Crane flocks wintering at Shengjin Lake and,
   as well, to understand the response of wintering waterbirds to habitat
   degradation for future management decisions and protection of the
   population.
   Methods: We investigated food abundance, disturbances and flock foraging
   activities of the wintering Hooded Crane in several foraging habitats of
   Shengjin Lake from November 2013 to April 2014. Flock size and structure
   were observed by scan sampling. Data on food abundance and disturbances
   were collected by sampling. Flock size and structure were compared among
   three wintering stages. The relationship between food resources,
   disturbances and flock size were illustrated using a generalized linear
   model.
   Results: In the early and middle wintering periods, the Hooded Crane
   used paddy fields as its major foraging habitat, where the number of
   foraging birds and flocks were the highest. During the late period, the
   cranes took to meadows as their major foraging habitat. The variation
   among foraging flock was mainly embodied in the size of the flocks,
   while the age composition of these flocks did not change perceptibly.
   Family flocks were notably different from flock groups in size and age
   composition. The results of a generalized linear model showed that the
   food abundance had a marked effect on foraging flock size and age
   composition, while disturbances had a significant effect only on flock
   size. From our analysis, it appeared that the combined effect of the two
   variables was significant on the size of the foraging flock, but had
   less impact on age composition.
   Conclusions: Food abundance and disturbances affected the flock size of
   the Hooded Crane. With abundant food and high disturbances, flock sizes
   increased owing to cooperation in foraging. To avoid competition and
   maximize foraging benefits, flock size reduces with an abundance of food
   but low disturbance. By trading off risks and costs, the cranes showed
   flexible flock distributions and a variety of foraging strategies to
   maximize benefits and to improve their fitness.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Predation is a major factor driving evolution, and organisms have
   evolved adaptations increasing their survival chances. However, most
   defenses incur trade-offs between benefits and costs. Many organisms
   save costs by employing inducible defenses as responses to fluctuating
   predation risk. The level of defense often increases with predator
   densities. However, individual predation risk should not only depend on
   predator density but also on the density of conspecifics. If the
   predator has a saturating functional response one would predict a
   negative correlation between prey density and individual predation risk
   and hence defense expression. Here, we tested this hypothesis using six
   model systems, covering a taxonomic range from protozoa to rotifers and
   crustaceans. In all six systems, we found that the level of defense
   expression increased with predator density but decreased with prey
   density. In one of our systems, i.e. in Daphnia, we further show that
   the response to prey density is triggered by a chemical cue released by
   conspecifics and congeners. Our results indicate that organisms adjust
   the degree of defense to the acute predation risk, rather than merely to
   predators' densities. Our study suggests that density-dependent defense
   expression reflects accurate predation-risk assessment and is a general
   principle in many inducible-defense systems.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental variation is a potent force affecting phenotypic
   expression. While freshwater fishes have provided a compelling example
   of the link between the environment and phenotypic diversity, few
   studies have been conducted with arid-zone fishes, particularly those
   that occur in geographically isolated regions where species typically
   inhabit intermittent and ephemeral creeks. We investigated morphological
   variation of a freshwater fish (the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia
   australis) inhabiting creeks in the Pilbara region of northwest
   Australia to determine whether body shape variation correlated with
   local environmental characteristics, including water velocity, habitat
   complexity, predator presence, and food availability. We expected that
   the geographic isolation of creeks within this arid region would result
   in habitat-specific morphological specializations. We used
   landmark-based geometric morphometrics to quantify the level of
   morphological variability in fish captured from 14 locations within
   three distinct subcatchments of a major river system. Western
   rainbowfish exhibited a range of morphologies, with variation in body
   depth accounting for a significant proportion (>42\%) of the total
   variance in shape. Sexual dimorphism was also apparent, with males
   displaying deeper bodies than females. While the measured local habitat
   characteristics explained little of the observed morphological
   variation, fish displayed significant morphological differentiation at
   the level of the subcatchment. Local adaptation may partly explain the
   geographic patterns of body shape variation, but fine-scale genetic
   studies are required to disentangle the effects of genetic
   differentiation from environmentally determined phenotypic plasticity in
   body shape. Developing a better understanding of environment-phenotype
   relationships in species from arid regions will provide important

Abstract = {{Intraspecific aggression is an important aspect of social behaviour that

   ecological determinants of aggressiveness and cannibalism in cave
   vertebrates. In this study, we evaluated the role of density,
   competition for food, starvation and rearing history under cave-like
   conditions in promoting aggression. We performed a behavioural
   experiment on larvae collected from multiple underground springs and
   neighbouring streams, and we reared them under two different settings:
   total darkness and outdoor conditions. Intraspecific attacks were very
   scarce in hatchlings, and increased after 1 month. Starvation periods
   and high density clearly increased aggressiveness. Furthermore,
   aggressiveness strongly increased under competition conditions (presence
   of other larvae feeding). Aggressiveness increased with age more quickly
   in larvae from caves than in those from streams. Environmental features
   typically experienced by cave populations, such as starvation and high
   density, increase intraspecific attacks and might promote cannibalism.
   Strong plasticity for aggression may enhance the possibility to
   successfully colonize and exploit food-deprived environments where no

Abstract = {{Variation in life-history traits can have major impacts on the

   many once-limited resources, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, with
   potentially major implications for the expression and evolution of life
   history trade-offs. In this review, we synthesize contemporary life
   history and sexual selection literature with current research on
   ecosystem nutrient cycling to highlight novel opportunities presented by
   anthropogenic environmental change for investigating life-history trait
   development and evolution. Specifically, we review four areas where
   nutrition plays a pivotal role in life-history evolution and explore
   possible implications in the face of rapid, human-induced change in

   nutrients may relax historical life-history trade-offs and reduce the

Abstract = {{Cognitive mechanisms underlying the choice of movement patterns between
   resource sites for nonhuman primates are not well understood.
   Specifically, the influence of landscape features on decision making and
   spatial memory of naturally ranging animals has not been explicitly
   investigated. We evaluated three models of bearded capuchin monkey,
   Sapajus libidinosus, movement decisions that incorporated varying
   degrees of landscape and memory influences, and we conducted a field
   experiment using a novel call-back technique to test these influences.
   The movements and spatial decisions of the monkeys were modelled between
   temporal stop points and spatial change points during natural travel
   using straight-line path, a minimum-resistance path and
   landscape-perceiving path models. For these movement models, resistance
   was calculated as the inverse of habitat suitability, a surface based on
   the natural movement patterns of the study group. Of the three models,
   natural travel most closely resembled the straight-line path model in
   its landscape resistance, but not in its geometry. This result indicates
   that while the monkeys travel in zones of low resistance, they do not
   minimize distance or landscape resistance between travel nodes. When
   monkeys were called to an artificial resource site using the call-back
   experiment, their travel was more linear and higher in landscape
   resistance. The limited quantity and high quality of the food resource
   in the artificial resource sites may have influenced the nature of the
   monkeys' travel in these experiments. We present the advantages and
   challenges of the call-back method of experimental analysis of animal
   movement and we conclude that future analyses of spatial cognition
   should include consideration of landscape context. (C) 2015 The

   mealworms injected with bitter solutions (quinine hydrochloride
   dihydrate or denatonium benzoate at 50 or 500 mM) as prey. We observed
   that males had a low level of acceptance for bitter prey: unlike
   females, they reduced consumption of mealworms injected with 50 mM of
   these bitter solutions. However, they showed higher motivation (unlike
   females, their rate of attack on prey increased when they reduced their
   consumption of mealworms). This difference in ingestion between the
   sexes did not seem to be due to different sensitivities for these bitter
   solutions (there was no detectable difference between the sexes in time
   taken to drink drops of these bitter solutions). Instead, this seems
   related to males and females having different feeding strategies based
   on different nutritive requirements. The possible effects of nutritional
   composition of prey on avoidance behaviours in predatory insects are
   discussed. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Sociability in animals provides benefits such as reduced predation risk
   and increased foraging efficiency. During the early stages of invasion,
   individuals are often vulnerable as part of a small population (Allee
   effects); associations with native heterospecifics could mitigate some
   of the disadvantages of small population size and thereby increase the
   chances of establishment success. Here we explored two potential
   benefits of heterospecific association to guppies, Poecilia reticulata,
   a very successful invasive species. We first investigated whether
   guppies can exploit visual cues from morphologically similar
   heterospecific individuals as effectively as those from conspecifics. We
   next tested whether willingness to explore an unfamiliar environment
   depends on whether guppies are accompanied by conspecifics or
   heterospecifics. Our results show that guppies can acquire information
   on food availability from another species, as well as from conspecifics.
   We also found that guppies engaged in exploratory behaviour more quickly
   if the habitat had plants in it, and were more likely to associate if it
   was unstructured; there was, however, no difference in the frequency
   with which the focal fish was accompanied by a conspecific or a
   heterospecific individual. These results show that guppies respond to
   these heterospecifics as they do with conspecifics. Our study reveals
   some of the traits that could make an invader successful and potentially
   help to identify species with a higher potential to become established

Abstract = {{Food odors stimulate appetite and innate food-seeking behavior in hungry
   animals. The smell of food also induces salivation and release of
   gastric acid and insulin. Conversely, sustained odor exposure may induce
   satiation. We demonstrate novel effects of food odors on food ingestion,
   metabolism and endocrine signaling in Drosophila melanogaster. Acute
   exposure to attractive vinegar odor triggers a rapid and transient
   increase in circulating glucose, and a rapid upregulation of genes
   encoding the glucagon-like hormone adipokinetic hormone (AKH), four
   insulin-like peptides (DILPs) and some target genes in peripheral
   tissues. Sustained exposure to food odors, however, decreases food
   intake. Hunger-induced strengthening of synaptic signaling from
   olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to brain neurons increases food-seeking
   behavior, and conversely fed flies display reduced food odor sensitivity
   and feeding. We show that increasing the strength of OSN signaling
   chronically by genetic manipulation of local peptide neuromodulation
   reduces feeding, elevates carbohydrates and diminishes lipids.
   Furthermore, constitutively strengthened odor sensitivity altered gene
   transcripts for AKH, DILPs and some of their targets. Thus, we show that
   food odor can induce a transient anticipatory endocrine response, and
   that boosted sensitivity to this odor affects food intake, as well as
   metabolism and hormonal signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the impacts of climate change on communities requires
   understanding how temperature affects predator-prey interactions under
   different biotic conditions. In cases of size-specific predation,
   environmental influences on the growth rate of one or both species can
   determine predation rates. For example, warming increases top-down
   control of food webs, although this depends on resource availability for
   prey, as increased resources may allow prey to reach a size refuge.
   Moreover, because the magnitude of inducible defenses depends on
   predation rates and resource availability for prey, temperature and
   resource levels also affect phenotypic plasticity. To examine these
   issues, we manipulated the presence/absence of predatory Hynobius
   retardatus salamander larvae and herbivorous Rana pirica tadpoles at two
   temperatures and three basal resource levels. and measured their
   morphology, behavior, growth and survival. Prior work has shown that
   both species express antagonistic plasticity against one another in
   which salamanders enlarge their gape width and tadpoles increase their
   body width to reach a size-refuge. We found that increased temperatures
   increased predation rates, although this was counteracted by high basal
   resource availability, which further decreased salamander growth.
   Surprisingly, salamanders caused tadpoles to grow larger and express
   more extreme defensive phenotypes as resource levels decreased under
   warming, most likely due to their increased risk of predation. Thus,
   temperature and resources influenced defensive phenotype expression and
   its impacts on predator and prey growth by affecting their interaction
   strength. Our results indicate that basal resource levels can modify the
   impacts of increased temperatures on predator-prey interactions and its
   consequences for food webs.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Increased frequency of eating in the absence of homeostatic need,
   notably through snacking, is an important contributor to overconsumption
   and may be facilitated by increased availability of palatable food in
   the obesogenic environment. Opportunistic initiation of snacking is
   likely to be subject to individual differences, although these are
   infrequently studied in laboratory-based research paradigms. This study
   examined psychological factors associated with opportunistic initiation
   of snacking, and predictors of intake in the absence of homeostatic
   need. Fifty adults (mean age 34.5 years, mean BMI 23.9 kg/m(2), 56\%
   female) participated in a snack taste test in which they ate a chocolate
   snack to satiation, after which they were offered an unanticipated
   opportunity to initiate a second eating episode. Trait and behavioural
   measures of self control, sensitivity to reward, dietary restraint and
   disinhibited eating were taken. Results showed that, contrary to
   expectations, those who initiated snacking were better at inhibitory
   control compared with those who did not initiate. However, amongst
   participants who initiated snacking, intake (kcal) was predicted by
   higher food reward sensitivity, impulsivity and BMI. These findings
   suggest that snacking initiation in the absence of hunger is an
   important contributor to overconsumption. Consideration of the
   individual differences promoting initiation of eating may aid in
   reducing elevated eating frequency in at-risk individuals. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Women are more likely than men to exhibit motivational disorders (e.g.,
   anhedonia and anxiety) with limited treatment options, and to
   overconsume high-fat ``comfort foods{''} to improve motivational
   disruptions. Unfortunately, neurobiological underpinnings for sex
   differences in motivational disruptions and their responses to dietary
   fat are poorly understood. To help bridge these fundamental knowledge
   gaps, we assessed behavioral and neurobiological responses to dietary
   fat in a hamster model of female-biased motivational lability. Relative
   to social housing, social separation reduced hedonic drive in a new
   behavioral assay, the reward investigational preference (RIP) test.
   Fluoxetine or desipramine treatment for 21, but not 7, days improved RIP
   test performance. Pharmacologic specificity in this test was shown by
   non-responsiveness to diazepam, tracazolate, propranolol, or naltrexone.
   In the anxiety-related feeding/exploration conflict (AFEC) test, social
   separation worsened latency to eat highly palatable food under
   anxiogenic conditions, but not in home cages. Social separation also
   reduced weight gain, food intake, and adiposity while elevating energy
   expenditure, assessed by caloric efficiency and indirect calorimetry.
   Furthermore, chronic high-fat feeding improved anhedonic and anxious
   responses to separation, particularly in females. In the
   motivation-influencing nucleus accumbens, females, but not males,
   exhibited a separation-induced anxiety-related decrease in Creb1 mRNA
   levels and an anhedonia-related decrease in Delta Fosb mRNA levels.
   Consistent with its antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects on
   behavior, high-fat feeding elevated accumbal Creb1 and Delta Fosb mRNA
   levels in females only. Another accumbal reward marker, Tlr4 mRNA, was
   elevated in females by high-fat feeding, These results show that social
   separation of hamsters provides a novel model of sex-dependent comorbid
   anhedonia, anxiety, and anorexia, and implicate accumbal CREB, Delta
   FosB, and TLR4. Moreover, the results validate a new assay for chronic
   antidepressant efficacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   laevis and the amphipod Gammarus pulex}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several parasites with complex life-cycles induce phenotypic
   alterations in their intermediate hosts. According to the host
   manipulation hypothesis, such phenotypic alterations are supposed to
   increase the fitness of the parasite at the expense of that of its
   intermediate hosts through increasing the probability of transmission to
   next hosts. Although the phenomenon has received a large attention, the
   proximate factors modulating the occurrence and intensity of host
   manipulation remain poorly known. It has however, been suggested that
   the amount of energy reserves in the intermediate host might be a key
   parameter, although its precise influence on the intensity of
   manipulation remains unclear. Dietary depletion in the host may also
   lead to compromise with other parasite traits, such as probability of
   establishing or growth or virulence.
   Methods: Here, we address the question through performing experimental
   infections of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex with two different
   populations of the acanthocephalan fish parasite Pomphorhynchus laevis,
   and manipulation of host nutritional condition. Following exposure,
   gammarids were given either a ``standard{''} diet (consisting of elm
   leaves and chironomid larvae) or a ``deprived{''} food treatment
   (deprived in proteins), and infection parameters were recorded. Once
   parasites reached the stage at which they become infective to their
   definitive host, refuge use (a behavioural trait presumably implied in
   trophic transmission) was assessed, and metabolic rate was measured.
   Results: Infected gammarids exposed to the deprived food treatment
   showed a lower metabolic rate, indicative of a lower body condition,
   compared to those exposed to the standard food treatment. Parasite size
   was smaller, and, depending on the population of origin of the
   parasites, intensity of infection was lower or mortality was higher in
   deprived hosts. However, food treatment had no effect on either the
   timing or intensity of behavioural modifications.
   Conclusions: Overall, while our results suggest that acanthocephalan
   parasites develop better in hosts in good condition, no evidence was
   found for an influence of host nutritional condition on host
   manipulation by parasites.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Animals sometimes develop conspicuous projections on or near their heads
   as, e.g., weaponry, burrowing or digging tools, and probes to search for
   resources. The frontal projections that insects generally use to locate
   and assess resources are segmented appendages, including antennae,
   maxillary palps, and labial palps. There is no evidence to date that
   arthropods, including insects, use projections other than true segmental
   appendages to locate food. In this regard, it is noteworthy that some
   butterfly larvae possess a pair of long antenna-like projections on or
   near their heads. To date, the function of these projections has not
   been established. Larvae of pipevine swallowtail butterflies Battus
   philenor (Papilionidae) have a pair of long frontal fleshy projections
   that, like insect antennae generally, can be actively moved. In this
   study, we evaluated the possible function of this pair of long moveable
   frontal projections. In laboratory assays, both frontal projections and
   lateral ocelli were shown to increase the frequency with which search
   larvae found plants. The frontal projections increased finding of host
   and non-host plants equally, suggesting that frontal projections do not
   detect host-specific chemical cues. Detailed SEM study showed that
   putative mechanosensillae are distributed all around the frontal as well
   as other projections. Taken together, our findings suggest that the
   frontal projections and associated mechanosensillae act as vertical
   object detectors to obtain tactile information that, together with
   visual information from lateral ocelli and presumably chemical
   information from antennae and mouthparts, help larvae to find host
   plants. Field observations indicate that host plants are small and
   scattered in southern Arizona locations. Larvae must therefore find
   multiple host plants to complete development and face significant
   challenges in doing so. The frontal projections may thus be an
   adaptation for finding a scarce resource before starving to death. This
   is the first evidence that arthropods use projections other than true
   segmental appendages such as antennae, mouthparts and legs, to locate
   food resources.}},

Abstract = {{The internal state of an organism influences its perception of

   act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion at the
   level of the first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal
   lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses
   activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion. Thus we show parallel

Abstract = {{Dietary intake of the micronutrient selenium is essential for normal
   immune functions. Selenium is cotranslationally incorporated as the 21st
   amino acid, selenocysteine, into selenoproteins that function to
   modulate pathways involved in inflammation. Epidemiological studies have
   suggested an inverse association between selenium levels and
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and
   ulcerative colitis that can potentially progress to colon cancer.
   However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we
   summarize the current literature on the pathophysiology of IBD, which is
   multifactorial in origin with unknown etiology. We have focused on a few
   selenoproteins that mediate gastrointestinal inflammation and activate
   the host immune response, wherein macrophages play a pivotal role.
   Changes in cellular oxidative state coupled with altered expression of
   selenoproteins in macrophages drive the switch from a proinflammatory
   phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype to efficiently resolve
   inflammation in the gut and restore epithelial barrier integrity. Such a
   phenotypic plasticity is accompanied by changes in cytokines,
   chemokines, and bioactive metabolites, including eicosanoids that not
   only mitigate inflammation but also partake in restoring gut homeostasis
   through diverse pathways involving differential regulation of
   transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B and peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. The role of the intestinal
   microbiome in modulating inflammation and aiding in selenium-dependent
   resolution of gut injury is highlighted to provide novel insights into
   the beneficial effects of selenium in IBD.}},

Abstract = {{Food availability and temperature are known to trigger phenotypic

   independent and interactive effects of long-term stochastic food
   availability and water temperature on larval survivorship, growth and
   development of the striped marsh frog, Limnodynastes peronii. Larval L.
   peronii were reared in conditions of either constant or stochastic food
   availability and in water at three different temperatures (18, 22 and 26
   degrees C), and effects on survival, growth and development were
   quantified. Over the experimental period, larval growth rate was highest

Abstract = {{Adapting to exploit new food sources may be essential, particularly in
   winter, when the impact of food limitation on survival of individuals is
   critical. One of the most important additional sources of food for birds
   in human settlements is birdfeeders. At a large spatial scale, we
   experimentally provided birdfeeders with four different kinds of food to
   analyze exploitation and use of a novel food supply provided by humans.
   Nine species started foraging at the new birdfeeders. The species that
   exploited the new feeders the fastest was the great tit. Use of novel
   food sources was faster in urban habitats and the presence of other
   feeders reduced the time until a new feeder was located. Urbanization
   may be associated with behavioural skills, technical innovations and
   neophilia resulting in faster discovery of new food sources. This
   process is accelerated by the experience of feeder use in the vicinity,
   with a strong modifying effect of the number of domestic cats.}},

Abstract = {{The current study evaluated 17 loads of cull beef cows transported in
   Canadian winter conditions to assess in-transit temperature and
   humidity, evaluation of events during loading and unloading, and animal
   condition and bruising. Regardless of the use of boards to block
   ventilation holes in trailers, temperatures were higher within trailers
   than at ambient locations during both travel and stationary periods (P <
   0.01). Boarding was associated with smaller differences in trailer
   temperature, compared with ambient conditions, while the trailer was
   traveling at highway speeds versus when trailers were stationary (P <
   0.01). Moisture levels within trailers were not different from ambient
   conditions when loads using boarding were traveling (P < 0.01), whereas
   loads without boarding had a larger difference (P < 0.01). The moisture
   within trailers relative to ambient conditions increased when trailers
   were stationary compared with traveling when boarding was used (P <
   0.01). The majority of cattle transported were in good body condition
   (97.4\% within BCS of 2 to 3.5) and had calm temperaments (96.7\%).
   Although all comparisons were made, only the dog-house compartment had
   an increased risk of severe bruising compared with all other
   compartments (odds ratio {[}95\% confidence interval]: 3.0 {[}1.6-5.5],
   3.7 {[}2.16.4], 2.2 {[}1.3-3.7] and 3.8 {[}1.5-9.6] in comparison with
   the back, belly, deck, and nose compartments, respectively; P < 0.05).
   Increasing the duration of waiting to unload 30 min relative to a 1 h
   duration increased the odds of severe bruising by 1.18 times (95\%
   confidence interval: 1.09-1.29; P < 0.01). Scoring systems that have
   been developed for auditing unloading of cattle had limited variation
   across loads at both loading and unloading. Pretransport assessment of
   animal condition using the American Meat Institute's compromised animal
   score was the only scoring system that was consistent with posttransport
   scores. We inferred from the temperature and humidity data in the
   current study that under commercial conditions, boarding may increase
   ventilation within trailers during travel and decrease ventilation
   during stationary periods. The current study provides the first
   indication that issues in Canadian cull cow transport may be related to
   pretransport animal condition and management of unloading.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic stability are major components of
   the adaptive evolution of organisms to environmental variation. The
   invariant two-egg clutch size of Eudyptes penguins has recently been
   proposed to be a unique example of a maladaptive phenotypic stability,
   while their egg mass is a plastic trait. We tested whether this
   phenotypic plasticity during reproduction might result from constraints
   imposed by migration (migratory carry-over effect) and breeding (due to
   the depletion of female body reserves). For the first time, we examined
   whether these constraints differ between eggs within clutches and
   between egg components (yolk and albumen). The interval between colony
   return and clutch initiation positively influenced the yolk mass, the
   albumen mass, and the subsequent total egg mass of first-laid eggs. This
   time interval had only a slight negative influence on the yolk mass of
   second-laid eggs and no influence on their albumen and subsequent total
   masses. For both eggs, female body mass at laying positively influenced
   albumen and total egg masses. Female investment into the entire clutch
   was not related to the time in the colony before laying but increased
   with female body mass. These novel results suggest that the unique
   intraclutch egg size dimorphism exhibited in Eudyptes penguins, with
   first-laid eggs being consistently smaller than second-laid eggs, might
   be due to a combination of constraints: a migratory carry-over effect on
   the first-laid egg and a body reserve depletion effect on the
   second-laid egg. Both these constraints might explain why the timing of
   reproduction, especially egg formation, is narrow in migratory capital
   breeders.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Research has shown that if a mother experiences a transitory
   perturbation to her environment during pregnancy or lactation, there are
   transgenerational consequences often involving a disordered metabolic
   phenotype in first generation offspring with recovery across subsequent
   generations. In contrast, little is known about the nature of the
   transgenerational response of offspring when a mother experiences a
   perturbation that is not transitory but instead persists across
   generations. Our study, using a rat model, subjected the parental
   generation to a change in environment and concomitant shift from a
   grain-based to obesogenic diets to generate an adipose phenotype in
   first generation offspring emulating a common scenario in human
   urbanisation and migration. We then investigated whether the obese
   phenotype was stable across generations when maintained in the
   transitioned environment, and whether dietary macronutrient balance
   affected the response. We found that second and third generation
   offspring had a reduced body fat to lean mass ratio and a reduced
   appetite relative to first generation offspring, irrespective of dietary
   macronutrient balance. The trajectory of this response is suggestive of
   a reduction in chronic disease risk across generations. This is one of
   the first studies, to our knowledge, to investigate the
   transgenerational response following parental transition to a persistent
   obesogenic environment, and to demonstrate that successive generations
   respond differently to this constant environment.}},

Abstract = {{As landscapes across the globe experience increasing human development,
   it is critical to identify the behavioral responses of wildlife to this
   change given associated shifts in resource availability and risk from
   human activity. This is particularly important for large carnivores as
   their interactions with people are often a source of conflict, which can
   impede conservation efforts and require extensive management. To examine
   the adaptations of a large carnivore to benefits and risks associated
   with human development we investigated black bear behavior in three
   systems in the western United States. Our objectives were to (1)
   identify temporal patterns of selection for development within a year
   and across years based on natural food conditions, (2) compare spatial
   patterns of selection for development across systems, and (3) examine
   individual characteristics associated with increased selection for
   development. Using mixed effects resource selection models we found that
   bear selection for development was highly dynamic, varying as a function
   of changing environmental and physiological conditions. Bears increased
   their use of development in years when natural foods were scarce,
   throughout the summer-fall, as they aged, and as a function of gender,
   with males exhibiting greater use of development. While patterns were
   similar across systems, bears at sites with poorer quality habitat
   selected development more consistently than bears at sites with higher
   quality habitat. Black bears appear to use development largely for food
   subsidy, suggesting that conflicts with bears, and potentially other
   large carnivores, will increase when the physiological demand for
   resources outweighs risks associated with human activity. Published by

Abstract = {{Survival and the underlying causes of mortality are key demographic
   parameters for understanding animal population dynamics and identifying
   conservation needs. Here we use a large data set of tagged wild
   pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata) to examine the influence of
   individual traits (age, sex, size, movements and reproduction), and of
   temporal and spatial variations on the survival of this steppe-bird of
   conservation concern in Europe. Annual survival for adults and juveniles
   was estimated at 0.60 and 0.61, respectively. Survival rate tended to be
   lower towards the northern margin of the European distribution. In the
   core distribution area (central Spain) mortality was more frequent
   during the non-breeding season due to higher predation rates. Survival
   rate was slightly higher in males than females, which may explain male
   skewed population sex-ratios. Sedentary birds had lower survival than
   birds using different areas for breeding and wintering, indicating that
   high mobility, as a possible behavioural response to varying conditions,
   could eventually increase fitness. Predation was the main cause of
   mortality, but illegal hunting was also recorded, indicating a need for
   stricter law enforcement and regulation plans. Sandgrouse can be
   characterized by a relatively slow life history (medium-high adult
   survival and low reproductive rate), with lower survival rates than
   other sympatric steppe birds of larger size. Management and conservation
   efforts should focus on maintaining a high adult survival within
   protected areas. Sandgrouse mobility, which positively influenced
   survival, should also be taken into account in conservation plans,
   especially when considering the size and connectivity of protected
   areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Report long-term outcomes of the NOURISH randomized
   controlled trial (RCT), which evaluated a universal intervention
   commencing in infancy to provide anticipatory guidance to first-time
   mothers on ``protective{''} complementary feeding practices that were
   hypothesized to reduce childhood obesity risk.
   METHODS: The NOURISH RCT enrolled 698 mothers (mean age 30.1 years, SD =
   5.3) with healthy term infants (51\% female). Mothers were randomly
   allocated to usual care or to attend two 6-session, 12-week group
   education modules. Outcomes were assessed 5 times: baseline (infants 4.3
   months); 6 months after module 1 (infants 14 months); 6 months after
   module 2 (infants 2 years) and at 3.5 and 5 years of age. Maternal
   feeding practices were self-reported using validated questionnaires. BMI
   Z-score was calculated from measured child height and weight. Linear
   mixed models evaluated intervention (group) effect across time.
   RESULTS: Retention at age 5 years was 61\%. Across ages 2 to 5 years,
   intervention mothers reported less frequent use of nonresponsive feeding
   practices on 6 of 9 scales. At 5 years, they also reported more
   appropriate responses to food refusal on 7 of 12 items (Ps <=.05). No
   statistically significant group effect was noted for anthropometric
   outcomes (BMI Z-score: P =.06) or the prevalence of overweight/obesity
   (control 13.3\% vs intervention 11.4\%, P =.66).
   CONCLUSIONS: Anticipatory guidance on complementary feeding resulted in
   first-time mothers reporting increased use of protective feeding
   practices. These intervention effects were sustained up to 5 years of
   age and were paralleled by a nonsignificant trend for lower child BMI
   Z-scores at all postintervention assessment points.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the drivers of complex systems is a major challenge felt by
   virtually all of biology. For complex societies, there is considerable
   interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how
   the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level
   phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual
   differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals'
   participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group
   composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition,
   group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We
   performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory
   conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and
   (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the
   laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task
   participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size:
   larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to
   participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies
   composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of
   attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our
   field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which
   colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size,
   morphological composition and personality composition; none of these
   effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found
   that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more
   spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that
   colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by
   spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics. The

Abstract = {{Although capture, handling and marking of birds as well as taking
   samples from them are ubiquitous and, in most cases, unavoidable
   procedures in ornithological research, their immediate effects on the
   individuals remain largely unstudied. Here, we present data over 3 years
   from a long-term field study on the breeding biology of the blue tit.
   Parents were captured at the nest when feeding 9-11-day-old young. For
   all birds, we measured the time of their first visit to the nest after
   capture and could thus establish their latency of return to the nest.
   After capture, parents stayed away a surprisingly long time (average 4.2
   h, up to 18 h) and nests were not visited by either parent for a
   duration that almost never occurred under natural conditions. Parental
   return latencies were strongly associated with previous captures. Birds
   caught, marked and sampled previously returned on average 4.4 h earlier
   than new birds. Still these birds took on average 1.9 h to return. Thus,
   capture itself can have strong effects on immediate behaviour. Once the
   birds returned to the nest, the time between nest visits was similar to
   that observed before capture, indicating that birds resumed normal
   feeding activities. Return latencies of parents and the time nests were
   left alone had no long-term effects on offspring or breeding success. We
   discuss possible causes of delayed parental return and methodological
   implications. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{121-137}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Foraging methods are highly variable, but can be grouped into two modes:
   searching and ambush. While research has focused on the functioning of
   each mode, the question of how animals choose which to use has been
   largely neglected. Here we consider a forager that exploits prey that
   are patchily distributed in space and time. This forager can either sit
   and wait for prey to appear or search for prey, which is more likely to
   result in encounters with prey but costs more energy and/or exposes the
   forager to greater predation risk. The currency that natural selection
   appears to have optimized will be determined by the additional costs of
   searching and whether there is a risk of starvation. We therefore
   compare the predictions of models based on currencies that consider only
   energy and predation risk to state-dependent models in which energy
   reserves are used to trade off predation rate, starvation rate and
   investment in growth. The choice of currency qualitatively affects how
   mode should change when prey abundance and prey patchiness increase. We
   show how differing prey distributions can explain variation in effects
   of experimentally increasing prey abundance. Our work has several
   implications for the study of foraging mode, population dynamics and the
   methods used to assess population size. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Title = {{Exploration costs promote conservative collective foraging in the social

Abstract = {{Collective choices of a food source are generally thought to arise from
   the amplification of individual preferences. However, costs associated
   with foraging can also influence food choice: animals faced with a
   poor-quality food source may either continue feeding on it (a
   conservative strategy), or search for a potentially more profitable one
   (a more risky strategy). Groups of nomadic, trail-following Malacosoma
   disstria caterpillars were offered a leaf of two different hosts, either
   side by side to determine preference, or at a distance to investigate
   how exploration costs affect food choice. Arenas with and without
   pheromone trails were used to distinguish between direct travel costs
   and unknown territory costs. When two leaves were side by side, groups
   of second-instar caterpillars showed clear preferences between host
   trees, whereas groups of fourth-instar larvae did not. When the two
   leaves were distant from each other, groups of second-instar
   caterpillars usually remained on the known source, irrespective of food
   preference or group size. These groups were more likely to relocate to a
   preferred food source when pheromone trails were present, suggesting
   that trails effectively decrease unknown territory costs. Groups of
   fourth-instar caterpillars were more likely to leave the known food
   source even when no trail was present, suggesting a developmental shift
   in costs associated with exploration. Our results show that collective
   choices reflect food preference when exploration costs are low
   (second-instar larvae with pheromone trails), but not when they are high
   (second-instar larvae without trails). Such a conservative foraging
   strategy can be adaptive if the exploration costs of leaving a known
   food source are greater than the potential benefits of discovering a
   better alternative, for example, in a homogenous environment like that
   of a tree. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{529}},
Pages = {{199-212}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Recruitment success in living marine resources is variable due to high
   survival variability of early life stages. Improving our understanding
   of how environmental and ecological factors mechanistically interact and
   influence larval fish growth and survival is necessary to better predict
   year-class strength and expected physiological and behavioural responses
   to climate warming. We use a state-dependent optimality model for the
   behaviour of larval Atlantic cod Gadus morhua to analyse trade-offs
   related to growth and survival. Temperature-dependent maximum growth
   rates and vertical profiles of temperature and stochastic prey
   availability are used as inputs within a mechanistic modelling framework
   that finds optimal behavioural strategies of vertical migration and
   foraging activity. The fitness criterion used is maximization of
   survival probability until the larvae reach a given body size (15 mm).
   Detailed descriptions of predation, physiology, growth and survival of
   larval cod emerge from simulations of the optimal strategies. The model
   shows that the effect of temperature on survival is complex. Increasing
   temperature may lead to faster growth and higher survival, but only when
   there is sufficient food. In poor food environments, higher temperatures
   make larvae more susceptible to predation as they take higher risks to
   satisfy their metabolic costs. Overall, these results suggest that
   larval Atlantic cod, especially those from warmer-water stocks, may
   experience reduced survival and recruitment in climate-change scenarios
   that predict both elevated temperatures and reduced food supply.}},

Abstract = {{Some seabird species have learnt to efficiently exploit fishing discards
   from trawling activities. However, a discard ban has been proposed as
   necessary in Europe to ensure the sustainability of the seas. It is of
   crucial importance for the management and conservation purposes to study
   the potential consequences of a discard ban on the foraging ecology of
   threatened seabirds. We assessed the influence of fishing activities on
   the feeding habits of 22 male and 15 female Audouin's gulls (Larus
   audouinii) from the Ebro Delta (Mediterranean Sea) during the breeding
   period using GPS loggers together with Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA),
   which provided new insights into their foraging behavior and trophic
   ecology, respectively. GPS data revealed different sex-specific foraging
   patterns between workdays and weekends. Females were highly consistent
   in that they foraged at sea throughout the week even though discarding
   stops at weekends. In contrast, males switched from foraging at sea
   during the week (when discards are produced) to an increased use of rice
   field habitats at weekends (when fishermen do not work). This
   sex-specific foraging behavior could be related to specific nutritional
   requirements associated with previous egg production, an energetically
   demanding period for females. However, on a broader time scale
   integrated by the SIA, both sexes showed a high degree of individual
   specialization in their trophic ecology. The need to obtain detailed
   information on the dependence and response of seabirds to fishing
   activities is crucial in conservation sciences. In this regard,
   sex-specific foraging behavior in relation to fisheries has been
   overlooked, despite the ecological and conservation implications. For
   instance, this situation may lead to sex differentiation in bycatch
   mortality in longlines when trawlers do not operate. Moreover, any new
   fisheries policy will need to be implemented gradually to facilitate the
   adaptation of a specialized species to a discard ban scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Species interactions are often context dependent, where outcomes vary in
   response to one or more environmental factors. It remains unclear how
   abiotic conditions like temperature combine with biotic factors such as
   consumer density or food quality to affect resource availability or
   influence species interactions. Using the large grasshopper Melanoplus
   bivittatus (Say) and a common wolf spider {[}Rabidosa rabida
   (Walkenaer)], we conducted manipulative field experiments in tallgrass
   prairie to examine how spider-grasshopper interactions respond to
   manipulations of temperature, grasshopper density, and food quality.
   Grasshopper survival was density dependent, as were the effects of
   spider presence and food quality in context-dependent ways. In high
   grasshopper density treatments, predation resulted in increased
   grasshopper survival, likely as a result of reduced intraspecific
   competition in the presence of spiders. Spiders had no effect on
   grasshopper survival when grasshoppers were stocked at low densities.
   Effects of the experimental treatments were often interdependent so that
   effects were only observed when examined together with other treatments.
   The occurrence of trophic cascades was context dependent, where the
   effects of food quality and spider presence varied with temperature
   under high-density treatments. Temperature weakly affected the impact of
   spider presence on Melanoplus bivittatus survivorship when all
   treatments were considered simultaneously, but different
   context-dependent responses to spider presence and food quality were
   observed among the three temperature treatments under highdensity
   conditions. Our results indicate that context-dependent species
   interactions are common and highlight the importance of understanding
   how key biotic and abiotic factors combine to influence species
   interactions.}},

Journal = {{NUTRITION \& DIETETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{107-113}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{AimThe hospital environment as a workplace has undergone rapid changes
   over the last 50 years. Despite this, there has been very little
   research exploring how dietitians working in hospitals perceive their
   workplace. Moreover, previous studies in this area have focused
   predominantly on examining the North American experience of dietitians.
   Only a handful of previous studies have investigated the experiences of
   Australian dietitians at different stages of their careers. Therefore
   this study, in part, addresses a gap in the extant literature by
   examining how New South Wales (NSW) public-hospital dietitians perceive
   their workplace and its influence on their ability to function as
   healthcare professionals.
   MethodsIn 2011, 32 in-depth interviews were conducted with dietitians
   from 11 NSW public hospitals. Participants were selected from four
   career stages: new graduates, mid-career, specialists and managers. Data
   from the interviews were analysed through a grounded theory approach.
   ResultsData analysis revealed that dietitians sought validation of their
   work experience from five sources within the workplace. In this paper,
   these five sources have been depicted as a conceptual model labelled the
   Five Sources of Value'. The five sources identified were: acquisition of
   knowledge; relationships with others; work culture; role clarity; and
   personal attributes. This study also found the relative importance of
   these values changed according to the career stage of the individual
   dietitian.
   ConclusionsThe retention and engagement of staff within a hospital
   environment is an ongoing issue for dietetic managers. The Five Sources
   of Value' identified through this study and their relative influence at
   different career stages may assist managers in developing workplace
   strategies that addresses the major areas of concern for many staff. As
   a result of the qualitative nature of this exploratory study, the
   generalisability of the findings are limited. To address this
   limitation, future research may follow a more quantitative approach.}},

Abstract = {{`Fight-or-flight' stress responses allow animals to cope adaptively to
   sudden threats by mobilizing energy resources and priming the body for
   action. Because such responses can be costly and redirect behavior and
   energy from reproduction to survival, they are likely to be shaped by
   specific life-history stages, depending on the available energy
   resources and the commitment to reproduction. Here, we consider how
   heart rate (HR) responses to acute stressors are affected by the
   advancing breeding season in a colonial seabird, the king penguin
   (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We subjected 77 birds (44 males, 33 females)
   at various stages of incubation and chick-rearing to three experimental
   stressors (metal sound, distant approach and capture) known to vary both
   in their intensity and associated risk, and monitored their HR
   responses. Our results show that HR increase in response to acute
   stressors was progressively attenuated with the stage of breeding from
   incubation to chick-rearing. Stress responses did not vary according to
   nutritional status or seasonal timing (whether breeding was initiated
   early or late in the season), but were markedly lower during
   chick-rearing than during incubation. This pattern was obvious for all
   three stressors. We discuss how `fight-or-flight' responses may be
   modulated by considering the energy commitment to breeding, nutritional
   status and reproductive value of the brood in breeding seabirds.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Overeating and obesity are associated with impulsivity. In
   studies among patients with a substance use disorder, impulsivity was
   found to be associated with substance-related attentional bias. This
   study examined whether obesity, impulsivity and food craving are
   associated with an attentional bias for high-calorie food. Methods:
   Obese (n = 185, mean BMI = 38.18 +/- 6.17) and matched healthy-weight (n
   = 134, mean BMI = 22.35 +/- 1.63) men (27.9\%) and women (72.1\%), aged
   18-45 years, took part in the study. Participants were tested on several
   self-report and behavioral measures of impulsivity (i.e., response
   inhibition and reward sensitivity) and self-reported trait craving. In
   addition, they performed a visual search task to measure attentional
   bias for high-and low-caloric foods. Results: Self-reported impulsivity
   influenced the relationship between weight status and detection speed of
   high-and low-caloric food items: High-impulsive participants with
   obesity were significantly faster than high-impulsive healthy-weight
   participants in detecting a high-caloric food item among neutral items,
   whereas no such difference was observed among low-impulsive
   participants. No significant effects were found on low-caloric food
   items, for trait craving or any of the behavioral measures of
   impulsivity. Conclusion: Self-reported impulsivity, but not trait
   craving or behavioral measures of impulsivity, is associated with an
   attentional bias for high-caloric foods, but only in people with
   obesity. It is in particular the speedy detection of high-caloric foods
   in the environment that characterizes the impulsive person with obesity,
   which in turn may cause risky eating patterns in a society were
   high-caloric food is overly present.}},

   MethodsData for this cross-sectional study were gathered from 4,763
   participants who had answered questions on subjective halitosis and
   psychological factors (depression, anxiety, stress and personality
   traits) in the study on the epidemiology of psychological, alimentary

   ResultThe mean age of all subjects was 36.58years; and the majority of
   subjects were female (55.8\%), married (81.2\%) and graduates (57.2\%).
   The prevalence of subjective halitosis was 52.8\%. The majority of
   subjects with the complaint of subjective halitosis were married

Abstract = {{Objective personality tests, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic

   specific pattern between body mass index (BMI) and psychological
   distress using the objective personality test. For this study, we
   investigated BMI and the Korean Military Multiphasic Personality
   Inventory (MPI). A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted
   with 19-yr-old examinees who were admitted to the Military Manpower
   Administration in Korea from February 2007 to January 2010. Of 1,088,107
   examinees, we enrolled 771,408 subjects who were psychologically

   reviewed and analyzed directly measured BMI and MPI results. In terms of
   the validity scales, the faking-good subscale showed an inverted

   U-shaped association with BMI groups. In terms of the neurosis scales,
   all clinical subscales (anxiety, depression, somatization, and

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of beta-alanine (BA) ingestion on
   the behavioral and neuroendocrine response of post-traumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) in a murine model. Animals were fed a normal diet with
   or without (PL) BA supplementation (100 mg kg(-1)) for 30 days. Animals
   were then exposed to a predator-scent stress (PSS) or a sham (UNEX).
   Behaviors were evaluated using an elevated plus maze (EPM) and acoustic
   startle response (ASR) 7 days following exposure to the PSS.
   Corticosterone concentrations (CS), expression of brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and brain carnosine concentrations were
   analyzed a day later. Animals in PSS+PL spent significantly less time in
   the open arms and in the number of entries in the EPM than PSS+BA,
   UNEX+BA, or UNEX+PL. Animals in PSS+BA had comparable scores to UNEX+BA.
   Anxiety index was higher (p < 0.05) in PSS+PL compared to PSS+BA or
   animals that were unexposed. ASR and freezing were greater (p < 0.05) in
   animals exposed to PSS compared to animals unexposed. CS expression was
   higher (p < 0.05) in animals exposed to PSS compared to unexposed
   animals. Brain carnosine concentrations in the hippocampus and other
   brain sections were significantly greater in animals supplemented with
   BA compared to PL. BDNF expression in the CA1 and DG subregions of the
   hippocampus was lower (p < 0.05) in animals exposed and fed a normal
   diet compared to animals exposed and supplemented with BA, or animals
   unexposed. In conclusion, BA supplementation in rats increased brain
   carnosine concentrations and resulted in a reduction in PTSD-like

Title = {{Brain size and urbanization in birds}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Brain size may affect the probability of invasion of urban
   habitats if a relatively larger brain entails superior ability to adapt
   to novel environments. However, once urbanized urban environments may
   provide poor quality food that has negative consequences for normal
   brain development resulting in an excess of individuals with small
   brains.
   Methods: Here we analyze the independent effects of mean, standard
   deviation and skewness in brain mass for invasion of urban habitats by
   108 species of birds using phylogenetic multiple regression analyses
   weighted by sample size.
   Results: There was no significant difference in mean brain mass between
   urbanized and non-urbanized species or between urban and rural
   populations of the same species, and mean brain mass was not
   significantly correlated with time since urbanization. Bird species that
   became urbanized had a greater standard deviation in brain mass than
   non-urbanized species, and the standard deviation in brain mass
   increased with time since urbanization. Brain mass was significantly
   left skewed in species that remained rural, while there was no
   significant skew in urbanized species. The degree of left skew was
   greater in urban than in rural populations of the same species, and
   successfully urbanized species decreased the degree of left skew with
   time since urbanization. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
   sub-optimal brain development was more common in rural habitats
   resulting in disproportionately many individuals with very small brains.
   Conclusions: These findings do not support the hypothesis that large
   brains promote urbanization, but suggest that skewness has played a role
   in the initial invasion of urban habitats, and that variance and skew in
   brain mass have increased as species have become urbanized.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Strategic ejaculation is a behavioural strategy shown by many animals as
   a response to sperm competition and/or as a potential mechanism of
   cryptic male choice. Males invest more mating resources when the risk of
   sperm competition increases or they invest more in high quality females
   to maximize their reproductive output. We tested this hypothesis in the
   false garden mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata, where females are
   capable of multiply mating and body condition is an indicator of
   potential reproductive fitness. We predicted male mantids would
   ejaculate strategically by allocating more sperm to high quality
   females. To determine if and how males alter their ejaculate in response
   to mate quality, we manipulated female food quantity so that females
   were either in good condition with many eggs (i.e. high quality) or poor
   condition with few eggs (i.e. low quality). Half of the females from
   each treatment were used in mating trials in which transferred sperm was
   counted before fertilisation occurred and the other half of females were
   used in mating trials where fertilisation occurred and ootheca mass and
   total eggs in the ootheca were recorded. Opposed to our predictions, the
   total number of sperm and the proportion of viable sperm transferred did
   not vary significantly between female treatments. Male reproductive
   success was entirely dependent on female quality/fecundity, rather than
   on the number of sperm transferred. These results suggest that female
   quality is not a major factor influencing postcopulatory male mating
   strategies in P. albofimbriata, and that sperm number has little effect
   on male reproductive success in a single mating scenario.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the impact of consumer confusion on nutrition
   knowledge, literacy, and dietary behavior. While previous research
   largely focuses on understanding why consumers might not respond to
   healthy eating communications, this paper seeks to uncover the various
   behavioral responses to such campaigns, particularly those that
   contravene health communication objectives. Using an interpretive
   methodology, findings suggest that most participants do respond to
   health communications by striving to eat healthily, but inadequate
   nutrition information derived from unreliable sources, flawed baseline
   nutrition knowledge, and poor nutrition literacy hinder participants'
   efforts. Inconsistent, incomplete, and contradictory information leaves
   many participants feeling confused about how to implement healthy eating
   habits. Further, a lack of ability to differentiate between credible and
   unreliable sources of nutrition information means that many participants
   blame their confusion on policymakers, and express frustration and
   cynicism toward vague and often contradictory communications. This, in
   turn, increases participants' reliance on food adverts, product labels,
   and other commercial sources of ambiguous yet appealing information. The
   paper's theoretical contribution includes a consumer confusion framework
   for healthy eating, and policy implications highlight that health
   campaigns seeking to increase consumer awareness of healthy eating are
   not enough. Policymakers must become the most credible sources of
   information about healthy eating, and distinguish themselves from
   competing and unreliable sources of nutrition information.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{32-35}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Bean weevil, Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae,
   Bruchinae) is a cosmopolitan pest of legume stored products. Storages
   with various legume seeds can facilitate shifts of the weevil from its
   primary host, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L), to other legume
   species and enable host expansion, i.e. broadening of the range of
   acceptable plant-hosts. In the first generation of host shift, survival
   of an insect depends on ability to adjust its physiology to altered
   content of nutrients and secondary metabolites in novel host. On a
   long-term scale, physiological adaptations to a new host can comprise
   modifications both in level and plasticity of physiological traits.
   Changes in activity of phosphatases play an essential role in this
   process due to their involvement in diverse functions. This study
   investigated alterations in activity of total acid, lysosomal acid and
   alkaline phosphatases using laboratory populations of A. obtectus which
   were maintained either on the optimal host (common bean) or on the
   suboptimal host (chickpea, Cicer arietinum L.) for 28 years. To
   determine short-term (plastic) effects, subsets of individuals from each
   population were exposed to the alternative host for one generation. Our
   results revealed that one-generation shift to chickpea significantly
   increased phosphatases' activity reflecting immediate plastic response
   to nutritional/allelochemical stress where these enzymes might be
   involved in defense mechanisms. On the other hand, both level and
   plasticity of phosphatases' activities significantly declined as a
   long-term response to Cicer-based diet suggesting that selection on
   chickpea favored resistance mechanisms that were less costly than
   phosphatases. Considering diverse roles of phosphatases we suggest that
   such modifications could be crucial for expanding host range and might
   have implications on efficiency of chemical and botanical insecticides.

Abstract = {{Behavioural innovation and morphological adaptation are intrinsically
   linked but their relationship is often poorly understood. In nematodes,
   a huge diversity of feeding morphologies and behaviours can be observed
   to meet their distinctive dietary and environmental demands.
   Pristionchus and their relatives show varied feeding activities, both
   consuming bacteria and also predating other nematodes. In addition,
   Pristionchus nematodes display dimorphic mouth structures triggered by
   an irreversible developmental switch, which generates a narrower mouthed
   form with a single tooth and a wider mouthed form with an additional
   tooth. However, little is known about the specific predatory adaptations
   of these mouth forms or the associated mechanisms and behaviours.
   Through a mechanistic analysis of predation behaviours, in particular in
   the model organism Pristionchus pacificus, we reveal multifaceted
   feeding modes characterised by dynamic rhythmic switching and tooth
   stimulation. This complex feeding mode switch is regulated by the
   neurotransmitter serotonin in a previously uncharacterised role, a
   process that appears conserved across several predatory nematode
   species. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of starvation, prey
   size and prey preference on P. pacificus predatory feeding kinetics,
   revealing predation to be a fundamental component of the P. pacificus
   feeding repertoire, thus providing an additional rich source of
   nutrition in addition to bacteria. Finally, we found that mouth form
   morphology also has a striking impact on predation, suppressing
   predatory behaviour in the narrow mouthed form. Our results therefore
   hint at the regulatory networks involved in controlling predatory
   feeding and underscore P. pacificus as a model for understanding the
   evolution of complex behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a rising interest in behavioural syndromes (correlations between
   different behaviours across context and time), the development of these
   syndromes is not well understood. Using the swordtail fish Xiphophorus
   multilineatus, we looked at the effects of maternal investment and
   social environment during development on the formation of a behavioural
   syndrome. A previous study demonstrated that the diet on which mothers
   were reared, controlling for their size, influenced the growth rate and
   size of their sons: females reared on high-quality diets had sons that
   grew faster and were larger at sexual maturity. In addition, males that
   were exposed to an adult male during development grew faster. We
   examined the behaviours of these same males across two contexts:
   aggression towards a mirror image and boldness under threat of
   predation. We detected an influence of maternal investment but not of
   social environment on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. The sons
   of mothers reared on high-quality diets exhibited a positive correlation
   between boldness and aggression, while there was no correlation among
   the sons of mothers reared on low-quality diets. Maternal investment
   influenced the formation of the syndrome by producing changes in only
   one of the behaviours, the behaviour most closely linked to energy
   acquisition (boldness under risk of predation) rather than energy
   expenditure (aggression). Our results suggest that energy balances could
   help predict the circumstances that would favour the formation of
   behavioural syndromes. Our results also support the hypothesis that
   behaviours involved in energy acquisition as compared to energy use will
   be more sensitive to fluctuations in variation in resources. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The trade-off between starvation and predation risk is of paramount
   importance to songbirds and many other small organisms. A contaminant
   with metabolic or neurological effects may hinder a bird's ability to
   manage these ecological risks, which are contingent on metabolic state
   and require cognitive assessments. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous
   pollutant that is associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive failure,
   altered behaviour and increased mortality in aquatic organisms. It was
   recently discovered that MeHg can enter terrestrial food webs and affect
   songbirds that eat contaminated invertebrates. Research on behavioural
   effects of environmentally relevant doses of MeHg in songbirds is a
   conservation priority as this pollutant is widespread, poorly regulated,
   increasing and understudied in terms of sublethal effects such as
   abnormal behaviours. To help close this knowledge gap, we examined how
   MeHg affects behavioural strategies in captive zebra finches,
   Taeniopygia guttata. We quantified the birds' responses to risk by
   measuring regulation of body mass, vigilance behaviour, willingness to
   move away from dense cover in search of food and reluctance to return to
   foraging after a disturbance. Dosed and undosed birds were placed in an
   experimental arena and were videorecorded over 3 days of increasing
   perception of predation risk. We found that MeHg-exposed birds, compared
   to control birds, (1) lost significantly more mass and (2) waited
   significantly longer to forage under the highest predation risk. Our
   results indicate that MeHg-exposed birds may react more strongly to
   threat of predation and thereby increase their risk of starvation. To
   our knowledge this is the first mechanistic study of how a pervasive
   pollutant may alter optimal decision making, and therefore potentially
   survival, in songbirds. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Response of Moose Hunters to Predation following Wolf Return in Sweden}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Predation and hunter harvest constitute the main mortality factors
   affecting the size and dynamics of many exploited populations. The
   re-colonization by wolves (Canis lupus) of the Scandinavian Peninsula
   may therefore substantially reduce hunter harvest of moose (Alces
   alces), the main prey of wolves.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We examined possible effects of wolf presence on hunter harvest in areas
   where we had data before and after wolf establishment (n = 25), and in
   additional areas that had been continuously exposed to wolf predation
   during at least ten years (n = 43). There was a general reduction in the
   total number of moose harvested (n = 31,827) during the ten year study
   period in all areas irrespective of presence of wolves or not. However,
   the reduction in hunter harvest was stronger within wolf territories
   compared to control areas without wolves. The reduction in harvest was
   larger in small (500-800 km(2)) compared to large (1,200-1,800 km(2))
   wolf territories. In areas with newly established wolf territories moose
   management appeared to be adaptive with regard to both managers (hunting
   quotas) and to hunters (actual harvest). In these areas an instant
   reduction in moose harvest over-compensated the estimated number of
   moose killed annually by wolves and the composition of the hunted
   animals changed towards a lower proportion of adult females.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We show that the re-colonization of wolves may result in an almost
   instant functional response by another large predator-humans-that
   reduced the potential for a direct numerical effect on the density of
   wolves' main prey, the moose. Because most of the worlds' habitat that

Title = {{Needs assessment of school and community physical activity opportunities
   in rural West Virginia: the McDowell CHOICES planning effort}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: McDowell CHOICES (Coordinated Health Opportunities Involving
   Communities, Environments, and Schools) Project is a county wide
   endeavor aimed at increasing opportunities for physical activity (PA) in
   McDowell County, West Virginia (WV). A comprehensive needs-assessment
   laid the foundation of the project.
   Methods: During the 6 month needs assessment, multiple sources of data
   were collected in two Town Hall Meetings (n = 80); a student online PA
   interest survey (n = 465); a PA and nutrition survey among 5th (10-11
   years) and 8th graders (13-14 years) with questions adapted from the
   CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (n = 442, response rate =
   82.2\%); six semi-structured school and community focus groups (n = 44);
   school site visits (n = 11); and BMI screening (n = 550, response rate =
   69.7\%).
   Results: One third of children in McDowell County meet the national PA
   minimum of 60 minutes daily. At least 40\% of 5th and 8th graders engage
   in electronic screen activity for 3 hours or more every day. The
   prevalence of obesity in 5th graders is higher in McDowell County than
   the rest of WV (similar to 55\% vs. 47\% respectively). SWOT analyses of
   focus group data suggest an overall interest in PA but also highlight a
   need for increase in structured PA opportunities. Focus group data also
   suggested that a central communication (e.g. internet-based) platform
   would be beneficial to advertise and boost participation both in current
   and future programs. Schools were commonly mentioned as potential
   facilities for public PA participation throughout the county, both with
   regards to access and convenience. School site visits suggest that
   schools need more equipment and resources for before, during, and after
   school programs.
   Conclusions: An overwhelming majority of participants in the McDowell
   CHOICES needs assessment were interested to participate in more PA
   programs throughout the county as well as to improve opportunities for
   the provision of such programs. Public schools were widely recognized as
   the hub of the communities and provide the best venue for PA promotion
   for both students and adult citizens, and can potentially serve as a
   platform for change in rural communities such as McDowell County.}},

Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{98}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This protocol describes the modified hole board (mHB), which combines
   features from a traditional hole board and open field and is designed to
   measure multiple dimensions of unconditioned behavior in small
   laboratory mammals (e.g., mice, rats, tree shrews and small primates).
   This paradigm is a valuable alternative for the use of a behavioral test
   battery, since a broad behavioral spectrum of an animal's behavioral
   profile can be investigated in one single test.
   The apparatus consists of a box, representing the `protected' area,
   separated from a group compartment. A board, on which small cylinders
   are staggered in three lines, is placed in the center of the box,
   representing the `unprotected' area of the set-up. The cognitive
   abilities of the animals can be measured by baiting some cylinders on
   the board and measuring the working and reference memory. Other
   unconditioned behavior, such as activity-related-, anxiety-related-and
   social behavior, can be observed using this paradigm. Behavioral
   flexibility and the ability to habituate to a novel environment can
   additionally be observed by subjecting the animals to multiple trials in
   the mHB, revealing insight into the animals' adaptive capacities.
   Due to testing order effects in a behavioral test battery, naive animals
   should be used for each individual experiment. By testing multiple
   behavioral dimensions in a single paradigm and thereby circumventing
   this issue, the number of experimental animals used is reduced.
   Furthermore, by avoiding social isolation during testing and without the
   need to food deprive the animals, the mHB represents a behavioral test
   system, inducing if any, very low amount of stress.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{522-530}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits' are behavioural differences between individuals that
   are stable within individuals. Different combinations of personality
   traits can correlate with fitness variation but the mechanisms remain
   unclear. There is the suggestion that personality reflects variation in
   physiology. For example, fast' (bold, active, fast exploring)
   individuals are predicted to maintain a higher metabolic rate than slow'
   animals. A raised metabolic rate can result in a proliferation of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) which, if unchecked, cause oxidative
   stress. Thus, the extended pace of life theory' predicts that fast'
   individuals will pay higher oxidative costs than slow' ones.
   Alternatively, stress hormones, which are often relatively high in slow'
   individuals, can also cause proliferation of ROS and subsequent
   oxidative damage. Here, we assessed co-variation between personality and
   oxidative profile in wild blue tits. The personality traits neophobia
   (latency to approach food near novel objects), activity level in a novel
   environment and exploratory tendency (controlling for differences in
   activity) assayed in captivity were repeatable within individuals but
   were uncorrelated with each other. Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs an
   index of pro-oxidant status) and OXY (antioxidant capacity) were also
   uncorrelated with each other and did not vary with age or sex. Blood
   sampling birds within three minutes of capture from their familiar cage
   vs. after 15min of exposure to a standardized stressor did not affect
   ROMs or OXY. Wintering blue tits that were both highly neophobic and
   exploratory had low OXY defences and individuals that showed low
   neophobia and low exploration had high OXY defences. Variation in ROMs
   was not explained by any personality trait. High exploratory tendency
   also correlated with a reduction in body condition in captivity, but
   body condition did not predict ROMs or OXY. Activity level in the
   exploration trial did not vary with oxidative profile or change in body
   condition. Personality types differed in antioxidant defences, and it
   was the combination of an individual's personality traits that proved
   important. ROS production and antioxidant defences will vary due to many
   processes for example resource allocation, not just metabolic rate and
   stress responsiveness. Consequently, the costs of personality traits and
   thus the predictions regarding fitness are complex.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects often affect fitness traits, but there is little
   experimental evidence pertaining to their contribution to response to
   selection imposed by novel environments. We studied the evolution of
   maternal effects in Drosophila populations selected for tolerance to
   chronic larval malnutrition. To this end, we performed pairwise
   reciprocal F-1 crosses between six selected (malnutrition tolerant)
   populations and six unselected control populations and assessed the
   effect of cross direction on larval growth and developmental rate, adult
   weight and egg-to-adult viability expressed under the malnutrition
   regime. Each pair of reciprocal crosses revealed large maternal effects
   (possibly including cytoplasmic genetic effects) on at least one trait,
   but the magnitude, sign and which traits were affected varied among
   populations. Thus, maternal effects contributed significantly to the
   response to selection imposed by the malnutrition regime, but these
   changes were idiosyncratic, suggesting a rugged adaptive landscape.
   Furthermore, although the selected populations evolved both faster
   growth and higher viability, the maternal effects on growth rate and
   viability were negatively correlated across populations. Thus, genes
   mediating maternal effects can evolve to partially counteract the
   response to selection mediated by the effects of alleles on their own
   carriers' phenotype, and maternal effects may contribute to evolutionary
   trade-offs between components of offspring fitness.}},

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1128-1138}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In animals with a complex life cycle, larval life-history plasticity is
   likely shaped by the interplay of selective factors in both larval and
   adult stages. A wide interspecific variation in responses to larval time
   constraints imposed by seasonality has been documented. Few studies have
   addressed differences among closely related species in the evolutionary
   trajectories of age and size at metamorphosis and their link with larval
   growth rate under time constraints. None have considered how
   species-specific length of the reproductive season affects larval
   developmental responses to time constraints. We tested in four
   Coenagrion damselfly species whether species with a longer reproductive
   season, facing a smaller threat of missing out on reproduction, react
   less to larval time constraints and pre-winter food shortage by
   accelerating development rate and growth rate, and therefore pay less
   physiological costs. All species increased development and growth rates
   under larval time constraints. The magnitude of this increase negatively
   correlated across species with the length of the reproductive season.
   Under larval time constraints, only the species exhibiting the longest
   reproductive season suffered a delayed emergence and a reduced
   investment in energy storage, yet also showed an increased immune
   function. Under a longer reproductive season, evolution may favor
   compensation for larval constraints after metamorphosis. Growth rate was
   accelerated after pre-winter food shortage to the same extent across
   species; effects on age and mass at emergence also did not differ among
   species. Time constraints associated with the length of the reproductive
   season may predictably contribute to species differences in their
   response to time constraints imposed in the larval stage. Our study adds
   empirical proof that the interplay of selective factors in the larval
   and adult stages may determine life-history plasticity with regard to
   larval time constraints.}},

Abstract = {{People often crave for high-caloric sweet foods when facing stress and
   this `emotional eating' is a most important cause for weight gain and
   obesity. Eating under stress contrasts with the normally expected
   response of a loss of appetite, yet in spite of intensive research from
   neurobiological and cognitive disciplines we still do not know why
   stress or negative affect triggers overeating in so many of us. Since
   the prevalence of overweight and obesity still rises, the discovery of
   crucial risk factors is a most desirable goal of today's research on
   sub-optimal eating habits. This paper summarizes the most relevant
   current knowledge from the (human) literature regarding cognitive and
   biological vulnerabilities for stress-induced emotional eating. A
   (non-systematic) review of the most relevant studies reveals that most
   studies contemplate a rather one-directional way of focusing on either
   cognitive or biological factors, showing inconsistent results. The
   current paper elaborates and/or integrates these findings into a
   biological cognitive interaction model in which a specific combination
   of genetic and cognitive vulnerabilities are thought to increase our
   bio-behavioral response to stress, critically increasing the rewarding
   value of pleasant foods and, hence, emotional eating. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{95-102}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Increasing performance work in the horse is often associated with a
   reduction in the forage ration and an increase in concentrates, usually
   in the form of high-starch cereal grains. This type of diet has been
   associated with stereotypic behaviours and health problems. High-starch
   diets are also associated with a high glycaemic response, which has been
   hypothesised to cause increased reactivity in horses. The aim of this
   project, therefore, was to evaluate responses of horses to novel stimuli
   and handling tests when fed a high-starch or a high-fibre diet.
   A cross-over design study incorporating 2 x 28 day periods was used to
   evaluate heart rates and behavioural responses during novel stimuli and
   handling tests when horses were fed a high-starch or a high-fibre diet.
   All measures were taken over five equally spaced sample points for each
   period. Data were initially assessed using factor analysis (Varimax
   rotation, SPSS) in order to produce combined traits of behavioural and
   heart rate measurements. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model (Genstat (R)
   edition 15) was used to analyse the effects of diet on mean data (over
   the five samples) for each factor as well as for all individual
   variables. In the handling test, factor 3 (heart rate reactivity) showed
   a significant relationship to diet (F-1,F-3=27.77, p<0.01). The
   individual handling test variables of maximum and average heart rates
   both showed a significant increase when horses were fed the high-starch
   diet compared to the high-fibre diet (F-1,F-3=10.84, p=0.017 and
   F-1,F-3=14.42, p=0.01). In the novel test factor 3 (eating reactivity)
   showed a significant relationship to diet (F-1,F-3=8.02, p=0.03) with
   horses demonstrating more interrupted eating when they were fed the
   high-starch diet compared to the high-fibre diet. The individual novel
   test variables showed that when horses were fed the high-starch diets
   their maximum heart rates were significantly higher (F-1,F-3=15.31,
   p<0.01) compared to the high-fibre diet. The results demonstrate that
   the high-starch diet had some effect on the reactivity and handling
   behaviour of horses, in particular their heart rate reactivity. (C) 2015

   Results: Dietary pattern 1 was characterized by low intakes of wheat

Abstract = {{A striking feature of human decision making is the fourfold pattern of
   risk attitudes, involving risk-averse behavior in situations of unlikely
   losses and likely gains, but risk-seeking behavior in response to likely
   losses and unlikely gains. Current theories to explain this pattern
   assume particular psychological processes to reproduce empirical
   observations, but do not address whether it is adaptive for the decision
   maker to respond to risk in this way. Here, drawing on insights from
   behavioral ecology, we build an evolutionary model of risk-sensitive
   behavior, to investigate whether particular types of environmental
   conditions could favor a fourfold pattern of risk attitudes. We consider
   an individual foraging in a changing environment, where energy is needed
   to prevent starvation and build up reserves for reproduction. The
   outcome, in terms of reproductive value (a rigorous measure of
   evolutionary success), of a one-off choice between a risky and a safe
   gain, or between a risky and a safe loss, determines the risk-sensitive
   behavior we should expect to see in this environment. Our results show
   that the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes may be adaptive in an
   environment in which conditions vary stochastically but are
   autocorrelated in time. In such an environment the current options
   provide information about the likely environmental conditions in the
   future, which affect the optimal pattern of risk sensitivity. Our model
   predicts that risk preferences should be both path dependent and
   affected by the decision maker's current state.}},

Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{94-98}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The mutualistic interaction between scatter-hoarding rodents and seed
   plants have a long co-evolutionary history. Plants are believed to have
   evolved traits that influence the foraging behavior of rodents, thus
   increasing the probability of seed removal and caching, which benefits
   the establishment of seedlings. Tannin and nutrient content in seeds are
   considered among the most essential factors in this plant-animal
   interaction. However, most previous studies used different species of
   plant seeds, rendering it difficult to tease apart the relative effect
   of each single nutrient on rodent foraging behavior due to confounding
   combinations of nutrient contents across seed species. Hence, to further
   explore how tannin and different nutritional traits of seed affect
   scatter-hoarding rodent foraging preferences, we manipulated tannin,
   fat, protein and starch content levels, and also seed size levels by
   using an artificial seed system. Our results showed that both tannin and
   various nutrients significantly affected rodent foraging preferences,
   but were also strongly affected by seed size. In general, rodents
   preferred to remove seeds with less tannin. Fat addition could
   counteract the negative effect of tannin on seed removal by rodents,
   while the effect of protein addition was weaker. Starch by itself had no
   effect, but it interacted with tannin in a complex way. Our findings
   shed light on the effects of tannin and nutrient content on seed removal
   by scatter-hoarding rodents. We therefore, believe that these and
   perhaps other seed traits should interactively influence this important
   plant-rodent interaction. However, how selection operates on seed traits
   to counterbalance these competing interests/factors merits further
   study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Males often exercise mate choice when mating frequency is constrained,
   costs of choice are low and variation in female quality and/or expected
   paternity can be reliably detected. Across invertebrates, males use sex
   pheromones to discern female mating status, but there are few
   demonstrations that information about expected fecundity ('quality') is
   encoded in pheromones alone. Here we examine whether females' sex
   pheromones allow males to detect differences in female food intake and
   mass in two species of widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus and
   Latrodectus hasselti) in which chemicals are deposited by females in
   silk. Recent work shows that male L. hesperus prefer well-fed females,
   and that these females produce more silk than hungry females. Thus,
   changes in diet could be mechanistically linked to changes in silk-bound
   pheromonal signals. We show that unmated females of both species lose
   more than half of their mass when food is withheld, and silk production
   is reduced by 48\% (L. hesperus) to 67\% (L. hasselti). Males had a
   significant sexual response to pheromones extracted from the females'
   silk in both species, although this response was not directly correlated
   with silk or female mass. In L. hesperus, but not in L. hasselti, males
   were less responsive to sex pheromones from food-deprived females
   compared to well-fed females. While females on good diets provide the
   benefit of higher fecundity in both species, the risk of being
   cannibalized by hungry females during courtship exists only in L.
   hesperus. We conclude that sex pheromones alone can provide information
   about recent female feeding history, possibly reducing the costs of
   males expressing choice in the field. The species difference in male
   response also suggests that male preferences in these spiders may depend
   less on the benefit of seeking a highly fecund female and more on
   avoiding the cost of risky mating attempts with a likely cannibal. (C)

   vigilance in paper wasp contests}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{259-266}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Animals frequently compete over limited resources such as food,
   territories or mating opportunities. Contest behaviour varies based on
   factors such as the value of the contested resources and the agonistic
   ability of rivals. Much work on animal contests has examined aggression,
   but vigilance, or a state of heightened alertness directed towards
   specific stimuli, may also be an important component of competition in
   many species. In this study, we measure the relationships among social
   vigilance, aggression, agonistic ability and resource value during
   staged contests over nest ownership in Polistes dominula nest-founding
   wasps. Our results show that both social vigilance and aggression are
   involved in mediating social risk during contests. Nest owner vigilance
   towards a rival increased with the time of season, a measure of nest
   value. Owner vigilance was also positively associated with aggression
   such that more aggressive owners were more vigilant. During contests,
   aggression of owners and rivals was influenced by different factors.
   Owner aggression was positively associated with nest size, another
   measure of nest value, while rival aggression was unrelated to nest
   size. Instead, rival aggression was associated with facial patterns that
   function as signals of agonistic ability; rivals were less aggressive to
   owners that signalled high agonistic ability than they were to owners
   that signalled low agonistic ability. The distinct predictors of contest
   behaviour between owners and rivals indicate that competitive role has a
   surprisingly strong influence on cues used to inform contest behaviour.
   Differences may occur because owners and rivals have different
   information and/or motivation. These results also suggest that social
   vigilance and aggression may be complementary behaviours that animals
   use to mitigate social threat. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Models of adaptive behaviour typically assume that animals behave as
   though they have highly complex, detailed strategies for making
   decisions. In reality, selection favours the optimal balance between the
   costs and benefits of complexity. Here we investigate this trade-off for
   an animal that has to decide whether or not to forage for food - and so
   how much energy reserves to store - depending on the food availability
   in its environment. We evolve a decision rule that controls the target
   reserve level for different ranges of food availability, but where
   increasing complexity is costly in that metabolic rate increases with
   the sensitivity of the rule. The evolved rule tends to be much less
   complex than the optimal strategy but performs almost as well, while
   being less costly to implement. It achieves this by being highly
   sensitive to changing food availability at low food abundance - where it
   provides a close fit to the optimal strategy - but insensitive when food
   is plentiful. When food availability is high, the target reserve level
   that evolves is much higher than under the optimal strategy, which has
   implications for our understanding of obesity. Our work highlights the
   important principle of generalisability of simple decision-making
   mechanisms, which enables animals to respond reasonably well to
   conditions not directly experienced by themselves or their ancestors}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is the ability held in many organisms to produce
   different phenotypes with a given genome in response to environmental
   stimuli, such as temperature, nutrition and various biological
   interactions. It seems likely that environmental signals induce a
   variety of mechanistic responses that influence ontogenetic processes.
   Inducible defenses, in which prey animals alter their morphology,
   behavior and/or other traits to help protect against direct or latent
   predation threats, are among the most striking examples of phenotypic
   plasticity. The freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex forms
   tooth-like defensive structures, ``neckteeth,{''} in response to
   chemical cues or signals, referred to as ``kairomones,{''} in this case
   released from phantom midge larvae, a predator of D. pulex. To identify
   factors involved in the reception and/or transmission of a kairomone, we
   used microarray analysis to identify genes up-regulated following a
   short period of exposure to the midge kairomone. In addition to
   identifying differentially expressed genes of unknown function, we also
   found significant up-regulation of genes encoding ionotropic glutamate
   receptors, which are known to be involved in neurotransmission in many
   animal species. Specific antagonists of these receptors strongly inhibit
   the formation of neckteeth in D. pulex, although agonists did not induce
   neckteeth by themselves, indicating that ionotropic glutamate receptors
   are necessary but not sufficient for early steps of neckteeth formation
   in D. pulex. Moreover, using co-exposure of D. pulex to antagonists and
   juvenile hormone (JH), which physiologically mediates neckteeth
   formation, we found evidence suggesting that the inhibitory effect of
   antagonists is not due to direct inhibition of JH synthesis/secretion.
   Our findings not only provide a candidate molecule required for the
   inducible defense response in D. pulex, but also will contribute to the
   understanding of complex mechanisms underlying the recognition of
   environmental changes, which form the basis of phenotypic plasticity.}},

Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Eating disorders appear to be caused by a complex interaction between
   environmental and genetic factors, and compulsive eating in response to
   adverse circumstances characterizes many eating disorders.
   Materials and Methods
   We compared compulsion-like eating in the form of conditioned
   suppression of palatable food-seeking in adverse situations in stressed
   C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, two well-characterized inbred strains, to
   determine the influence of gene-environment interplay on this behavioral
   phenotype. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that low accumbal D2
   receptor (R) availability is a genetic risk factor of food
   compulsion-like behavior and that environmental conditions that induce
   compulsive eating alter D2R expression in the striatum. To this end, we
   measured D1R and D2R expression in the striatum and D1R, D2R and alpha
   1R levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, by western
   blot.
   Results
   Exposure to environmental conditions induces compulsion-like eating
   behavior, depending on genetic background. This behavioral pattern is
   linked to decreased availability of accumbal D2R. Moreover, exposure to
   certain environmental conditions upregulates D2R and downregulates alpha
   1R in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, of
   compulsive animals. These findings confirm the function of
   gene-environment interplay in the manifestation of compulsive eating and
   support the hypothesis that low accumbal D2R availability is a
   ``constitutive{''} genetic risk factor for compulsion-like eating
   behavior. Finally, D2R upregulation and alpha 1R downregulation in the
   striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, are potential
   neuroadaptive responses that parallel the shift from motivated to
   compulsive eating.}},

Abstract = {{We compared glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression in the

   Rats were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) on P36. Male Wistar
   rats were split into two groups at birth according to diet (M or W) and
   subdivided according to environmental stimulation (E or N). GR
   expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and
   GR immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus. Our results showed that MN
   rats spent more time and made more entries into the open arms of the EPM
   compared to W rats. On the other hand, ME rats spent a similar
   percentage of time, and made a similar number of entries, in the open
   arms as WN rats. Following the EPM test, GR mRNA expression in the
   hippocampus was different in MN rats compared to W rats; expression was
   also different between M and ME rats; mRNA and expression of GR
   receptors in WN rats was similar to that observed in WE rats. These data
   also show that the effects of malnutrition on risk assessment in the EPM

Abstract = {{Predators can impact their prey via consumptive effects that occur

   dingo) has positive effects on both abundance and foraging efficiency of
   a desert rodent. Then by manipulating predators' access to food patches
   we further the idea that apex predators provide small prey with refuge
   from predation by showing that rodents increased their habitat breadth
   and use of `risky' food patches where an apex predator was common but
   mesopredators rare. Our study suggests that apex predators' suppressive
   effects on mesopredators extend to alleviate both mesopredators'

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{The fear induced by predators on their prey is well known to cause
   behavioural adjustments by prey that can ripple through food webs.
   Little is known, however, about the analogous impacts of humans as
   perceived top predators on the foraging behaviour of carnivores. Here,
   we investigate the influence of human-induced fear on puma foraging
   behaviour using location and prey consumption data from 30 tagged
   individuals living along a gradient of human development. We observed
   strong behavioural responses by female pumas to human development,
   whereby their fidelity to kill sites and overall consumption time of
   prey declined with increasing housing density by 36 and 42\%,
   respectively. Females responded to this decline in prey consumption time
   by increasing the number of deer they killed in high housing density
   areas by 36\% over what they killed in areas with little residential
   development. The loss of food from declines in prey consumption time
   paired with increases in energetic costs associated with killing more
   prey may have consequences for puma populations, particularly with
   regard to reproductive success. In addition, greater carcass
   availability is likely to alter community dynamics by augmenting food
   resources for scavengers. In light of the extensive and growing impact
   of habitat modification, our study emphasizes that knowledge of the
   indirect effects of human activity on animal behaviour is a necessary
   component in understanding anthropogenic impacts on community dynamics
   and food web function.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory on Mediterranean seagrass species is generally low compared to
   consumption of some other temperate and tropical species of seagrasses.
   In this study we: (1) investigate the feeding preference of the two
   dominant Mediterranean seagrass herbivores, the sea urchin Paracentrotus
   lividus and the fish Sarpa salpa, on Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea
   nodosa and (2) elucidate the role of epiphytes in herbivore choices. We
   assessed consumption rates by tethering seagrass shoots, and preferences
   by food choice experiments with the following paired combinations: 1)
   Epiphytized leaves of both C nodosa vs. P. oceanica (CE vs PE); 2)
   Non-epiphytized leaves of C nodosa vs. P. oceanica (CNE vs. PNE); 3)
   Epiphytized vs non-epiphytized leaves of C nodosa (CE vs. CNE) and 4)
   Epiphytized vs non-epiphytized leaves of P. oceanica (PE vs PNE). We
   found that preference for C nodosa was weak for S. salpa, but strong for
   P. lividus, the species responsible for most consumption at our study.
   Overall both herbivores showed preference for epiphytized leaves. The
   higher nutritional quality of C nodosa leaves and epiphytes together
   with the high coverage and diversity of the epiphyte community found on
   its leaves help explain the higher levels of herbivory recorded on
   epiphyted leaves of C nodosa. Other factors such as seagrass
   accessibility, herbivore mobility and size, and behavioral responses to
   predation risks, may also affect the intensity of seagrass herbivory,
   and studies addressing the interactions with these factors are needed to
   improve our understanding of the nature, extent and implications of

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses to food deprivation are a fundamental aspect of
   nervous system function in all animals. Several signaling molecules in
   the mammalian brain act through G proteins of the Gi/o family to mediate
   response to food restriction. The present study examined whether food
   intake changes under a condition of little stimulation to eat, such as
   that elicited by 4 h of food deprivation, was altered by Gi/o isoform
   silencing induced by intracerebroventricular (icy.) administration of
   antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODN) against the alpha subunit of
   G(i1), G(i2), G(i3), Go(1) and Go(2). The effect of aODN pretreatments
   on Food intake was evaluated 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after food
   re-administration. Selective effects were noted on food intake with
   anti-G(i alpha 1) (3.12-25 nmol), G(i alpha 3) (1.56-12.5 nmol) and G(o
   alpha 2) (3.12-25 nmol) aODN exerting increase in food consumption,
   while anti-G(i alpha 2) (3.12-25 nmol) and G(o alpha 1) (3.12-25 nmol)
   aODN exerting decrease in food consumption. We observed the effect of
   the alpha-subunit silencing on food consumption as soon as 15 min after
   food read ministration, that was still significant after 60 min. At the
   highest effective doses, different for each anti-G alpha i/o subunit,
   any treatment did not impair motor coordination, nor modified
   spontaneous mobility and exploratory activity. These results indicate a
   relevant distinction between G alpha i/o subunits on feeding behavior,
   and suggest that Gi/o proteins are critical for the integrative
   modulation of normal feeding behavior. Changes in Gi/o protein activity
   may be associated with modifications of feeding. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Objective: to investigate the presence of eating disorders (ED) and

   Design: Overweight/obese patients aged 11 to 14 y and normal-weight
   peers' data collected by means of self-report questionnaires
   administered to parents and children.
   Setting: Clinical Nutrition Units in the Municipalities of Rome, Naples,
   Gallipoli and Atri, Italy.
   Subjects: 376 preadolescents and adolescents. Patients were 187 (93
   boys, BMI=27.9 +/-;4.1; 94 girls, BMI=28.1 +/- 4.5); normal-weight
   controls were 189 subjects (94 boys, BMI=19.4 +/- 1.4; 95 girls,
   BMI=19.5 +/- 1.5).
   Measures of outcome: eating disorder behaviors, psychopathological
   traits and symptoms estimated by means of the eating disorders scales
   (EDI-2) and psychopathological scales (CBCL 4-18).
   Results: Patients reached higher scores than controls in most of the
   eating disorders scales and psychopathological scales. Twenty-one
   (11.2\%) patients were considered at risk of developing an eating
   disorder and 75 (40\%) presented social problems. With regard to weight

   Conclusions: Findings from our study demonstrate that in preadolescence
   and adolescence, obesity is significantly associated to some traits
   typical of ED and to psychological problems in general. Although no
   inference can be made with regard to direction of causality, it is
   possible to conclude that overweight preadolescents and adolescents can

Abstract = {{Some social signals are sexually selected both by female mating
   preferences and by male-male competition for mates. Studies of the
   behavioural mechanisms that mediate responses to these signals provide
   insight into how sexual selection operates. Courting male fiddler crabs,
   Uca terpsichores, sometimes build large sand structures called hoods at
   the openings to their burrows. Hoods attract females to males' burrows
   for mating because they elicit landmark orientation, a behaviour that is
   selected by predation. Males also orient visually to their own hoods
   when errors are introduced experimentally into their nonvisual mechanism
   for path integration. These errors occur naturally when males move far
   from their burrows to court females or fight neighbours. Here we
   explored whether courting males also use hoods as visual beacons to the
   location of their burrow. Crabs that rely on path integration to orient
   to their burrow keep their lateral axis closely aligned with the bearing
   home. We therefore measured and compared the distances males moved from
   their burrows and the maximum deviations between males' body axes and
   home bearings for males that did and did not build hoods, males that had
   their hood removed and males that had a hood added to their burrow.
   Males with hoods did not range further from their burrows than those
   without hoods, but they exhibited greater maximum deviations between
   their body axes and the bearings to their burrows. Hoods may facilitate
   courtship by allowing males to move more freely than when they rely on
   nonvisual path integration alone. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published on

Abstract = {{Stressful environmental conditions such as periods of poor nutrition
   have been shown to affect a variety of life history traits. Although
   nutrition-induced effects on the phenotype can appear through the entire
   life of an individual, it is becoming evident that there are sensitive
   periods during development when phenotypic traits have heightened
   sensitivity to nutritional conditions. Very few studies have
   investigated how nutrition can affect an important aspect of an
   organism's phenotype: the development of its `personality'. In this
   study we manipulated the availability of the main micronutrients (i.e.
   vitamins and essential minerals) present in the diet of zebra finches,
   Taeniopygia guttata, during their postnatal development and/or during
   their sexual maturation. Later, once the birds were fully adult, we
   assessed a series of behavioural traits previously used to assess
   personality in birds. We found that low availability of dietary
   micronutrients during the postnatal period resulted in reduced boldness
   in males once they reached adulthood, but had no effect on adult stress
   responses or neophobic behaviour. No such effects were found in females.
   In contrast, a low micronutrient diet during sexual maturation led in
   both sexes to reduced stress responses and neophobic behaviours in
   adulthood. Interestingly, we also found that females became more
   aggressive as adults if they had received a low micronutrient diet
   during development, irrespective of when the availability of
   micronutrients was modified. Overall, our results demonstrate
   substantial effects of diet on the development of behavioural traits,
   and that these effects differ both between the sexes and over different
   developmental periods. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Trait compensation denotes the situation in which individuals offset the
   costs of one trait with the benefits of another trait. The phenomenon of
   trait compensation is best exemplified by a negative correlation between
   the degree of predator avoidance and the strength of morphological
   defence. In this study, we used the relationship between risk-taking
   tendency (boldness) and the propensity for tail autotomy in the brown
   anole lizards Anolis sagrei to address two important questions regarding
   trait compensation. First, we investigated whether trait compensation
   existed among individuals of similar age. Second, we examined how the
   relationship between boldness and the propensity for tail autotomy
   responded to changes in food availability. Overall, bolder individuals
   autotomized their tails more readily. Although mean values of boldness
   and the propensity for tail autotomy did not differ under high and low
   food availability, the compensatory effect between the two traits was
   only obvious when food was abundant. The existence of trait compensation
   among similarly aged individuals will serve as the first step to
   understanding the evolution of compensatory effects among traits
   observed at higher level. In addition, food availability affected the
   dynamics of trait compensation by influencing the amount of variation of
   traits involved, rather than altering the mean values of traits per se.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anemia during the third trimester of fetal development
   affects one-third of the pregnancies in the United States and has been
   associated with postnatal behavioral outcomes. This study examines how
   fetal iron deficiency (ID) interacts with the fetal monoamine oxidase A
   (MAOA) genotype. MAOA metabolizes monoamine neurotransmitters. MAOA
   polymorphisms in humans affect temperament and modify the influence of
   early adverse environments on later behavior.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to advance translation of
   developmental ID research in animal models by taking into account
   genetic factors that influence outcomes in human populations.
   Methods: Male infant rhesus monkeys 3-4 mo old born to mothers fed an ID
   (10 ppm iron) diet were compared with controls (100 ppm iron). Infant
   monkeys with high-or low-transcription rate MAOA polymorphisms were
   equally distributed between diet groups. Behavioral responses to a
   series of structured experiences were recorded during a 25-h separation
   of the infants from their mothers.
   Results: Infant monkeys with low-transcription MAOA polymorphisms more
   clearly demonstrated the following ID effects suggested in earlier
   studies: a 4\% smaller head circumference, a 39\% lower cortisol
   response to social separation, a 129\% longer engagement with novel
   visual stimuli, and 33\% lesser withdrawal in response to a human
   intruder. The high MAOA genotype ID monkeys demonstrated other ID
   effects: less withdrawal and emotionality after social separation and
   lower ``fearful{''} ratings.
   Conclusion: MAOA 3 ID interactions support the role of monoamine
   neurotransmitters in prenatal ID effects in rhesus monkeys and the
   potential involvement of common human polymorphisms in determining the
   pattern of neurobehavioral effects produced by inadequate prenatal
   nutrition.}},

Abstract = {{The gut microbiota is intimately involved in numerous aspects of normal
   human physiology, including nutrition and metabolism, immunomodulation
   and behavior and stress response. Intestinal dysbiosis can be a
   contributing cause of many diseases, altering the function of both near

   dramatic physiological changes to support the growth of fetus-placenta,
   while intestinal dysbiosis may directly or indirectly disturb the
   remodeling of physiological balance, leading to maternal maladaptation.
   Thus, intestinal dysbiosis, i.e., altered composition or metabolism of
   microbiota may adversely affect pregnancy outcome and lead to pregnancy
   complications via disrupting maternal adaptation. Indeed, pregnant women
   with potential maladaptations are at high risk of developing pregnancy
   disorders, which is increasingly observed in clinical cases. Here we
   discuss the hypothesis that intestinal dysbiosis may induce pregnancy

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal constrains the environmental heterogeneity to which a
   plant species is exposed through its life. Behavior of seed dispersers
   and seed predators could be influenced by food availability and
   vegetation cover. Consequently, recruitment probabilities are
   heterogeneous in space and time, and ``regeneration windows{''} may
   appear. Aristotelia chilensis is the most abundant fleshy-fruited shrub
   in the temperate forest of southern South America (TFSA). TFSA exhibits
   an environmental patchiness that could influence fruit abundance and
   animal behavior. Our objective was to determine the regeneration windows
   of A. chilensis, and to detect how forest structure and animal behavior
   could affect the spatial distribution of this species. We characterized
   forest structure in two plots that included mature forest, young forest,
   and open areas. We assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of A.
   chilensis fruits and studied fruit removal by animals. Also, we
   experimentally evaluated germination and post-dispersal seed predation.
   We developed a conceptual model to relate A. chilensis recruitment with
   forest successional stages. The fruiting individuals of this shrub were
   mostly located in fire-opened areas or forest gaps, and the seed rain
   generated by the migratory bird Elaenia albiceps was denser in these
   areas. In contrast, seed predation by rodents was higher in closed,
   young forest areas. A. chilensis recruitment follows a nucleation
   dynamic around fruiting females. Concerning forest succession, A.
   chilensis recruitment was higher near re-sprouting females in open
   areas, and lowest in young forests, where fruiting process was hindered
   by light constraints. When forests mature, new nucleation processes
   start around females surviving in gaps. We conclude that areas opened by
   disturbances provide a regeneration window for A. chilensis shrubs.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of developmental, nutritional, environmental, and social
   factors affect the biological activities of epigenetic mechanisms. These
   factors change spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in a variety
   of different ways and bring significant impacts to bear on development,
   physiology, and disease risk throughout the life course. Abundant
   evidence demonstrates that behavioral stressors and adverse nutritional
   conditions are particularly potent inducers of epigenetic changes and
   enhancers of chronic disease risks. Recent insights from both human
   clinical studies and research with model organisms further indicate that
   such experience-dependent changes to the epigenome can be transmitted
   through the germline across multiple generations, with important
   consequences for the heritability of both adaptive and maladaptive
   phenotypes. Epigenetics research thus offers many possibilities for
   developing informative biomarkers of acquired chronic disease risk and
   determining the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic
   interventions. Moreover, the experience-sensitive nature of these
   disease risks raises important questions about societal and individual
   responsibilities for the prevention of ill-health and the promotion of
   well-being during development, across the life course and between
   generations. Better understanding of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate
   developmental plasticity and mediate the biological embedding of chronic
   disease risks is therefore likely to shed important new light on the
   nature of the pathophysiological mechanisms linking social and health
   inequalities, and will help to inform public policy initiatives in this

Abstract = {{Background \& AimsWeight management is a cornerstone of treatment for
   overweight/obese persons with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
   This exploratory study sought to: (i) evaluate readiness to change
   weight-related behaviours; (ii) assess psychosocial characteristics that
   may interfere with weight loss; and (iii) evaluate how baseline
   psychosocial features associate with 6-month change in weight in persons
   with NAFLD receiving standard medical care. The purpose of this
   investigation was to develop hypotheses regarding relationships between
   psychosocial factors and weight for use in future fully powered studies
   and clinical interventions
   MethodsFifty-eight overweight/obese participants with NAFLD completed
   baseline measures of personality, psychiatric symptoms and readiness for
   behaviour change and were followed up for 6months in standard care.
   ResultsOne-third of participants (31.0\%) were not interested in making
   weight-related behaviour changes; 58.6\% were considering making a
   change, and 10.4\% of individuals were actively working on or preparing
   to change. Six-month change in weight was non-significant and was not
   associated with baseline readiness for change. Depression, low
   conscientiousness and high neuroticism were associated with higher
   weight at 6-month follow-up with small to large effect sizes.
   ConclusionsAlthough participants received nutritional education and
   guidance, very few individuals presented in the active stage of change.
   Although readiness for change did not predict subsequent change in
   weight, personality factors and psychiatric symptoms were associated
   with weight outcomes. Integrated multidisciplinary approaches that
   address psychiatric needs and provide behavioural support for weight
   loss may help patients with NAFLD implement sustained lifestyle changes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the relationship among sedentary

   A cross-sectional analysis was performed on 2003-2006 National Health

   thousand yen18 years (mean +/- SD = 43.8 +/- 19.5). SB was measured
   using ActiGraph accelerometers worn for 1 week and defined as < 100
   counts/min. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the Adult Treatment
   Panel III criteria. Natural cubic spline logistic regression models were
   used to estimate the odds of meeting criteria for the metabolic syndrome
   and its components by total daily SB time and breaks in SB. Statistical
   interactions between SB and age, sex and MVPA were explored.
   The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 19\% and the average daily
   SB time was 8.1 +/- 2.8 h, with 90 +/- 25 breaks/day. The relationship
   between daily SB time and the metabolic syndrome was linear and
   characterised by an OR of 1.09 (95\% CI 1.01, 1.18) for each hour of SB.
   Total SB was associated with the following components: high
   triacylglycerol, low HDL-cholesterol and high fasting glucose. All three
   associations were modified by MVPA level. No relationship between breaks
   in SB and the metabolic syndrome was found.
   There appears to be no SB threshold at which the risk of the metabolic
   syndrome is elevated. Therefore, an effort should be made to maintain
   low levels of total time spent in SB and so lessen the risk of the

Abstract = {{Movement is a key mean for mobile species to cope with heterogeneous
   environments. While in herbivorous mammals large-scale migration has
   been widely investigated, finescale movement responses to local
   variations in resources and predation risk remain much less studied,
   especially in savannah environments. We developed a novel approach based
   on complementary movement metrics (residence time, frequency of visits
   and regularity of visits) to relate movement patterns of a savannah
   grazer, the blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, to fine-scale
   variations in food availability, predation risk and water availability
   in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Wildebeests spent more time
   in grazing lawns where the grass is of higher quality but shorter than
   in seep zones, where the grass is of lower quality but more abundant.
   Although the daily distances moved were longer during the wet season
   compared to the dry season, the daily net displacement was lower, and
   the residence time higher, indicating a more frequent occurrence of
   area-concentred searching. In contrast, during the late dry season the
   foraging sessions were more fragmented and wildebeests moved more
   frequently between foraging areas. Surprisingly, predation risk appeared
   to be the second factor, after water availability, influencing movement
   during the dry season, when resources are limiting and thus expected to
   influence movement more. Our approach, using complementary analyses of
   different movement metrics, provided an integrated view of changes in
   individual movement with varying environmental conditions and predation
   risk. It makes it possible to highlight the adaptive behavioral
   decisions made by wildebeest to cope with unpredictable environmental
   variations and provides insights for population conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid changes to climate in the western Antarctic Peninsula region over
   the last 50 yr, which have led to decreases in the extent and duration
   of sea ice, are likely to have significant impacts upon the Antarctic
   ecosystem as a whole. Understanding the behaviour of higher trophic
   level animals occupying these regions is important, as they may be
   indicators of changes in prey availability and food-web structure.
   Leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx are important components of the
   Antarctic ecosystem, because they are widespread and adapted to
   consuming prey at a range of trophic levels. They rely on sea ice for
   breeding, moulting and as a resting platform. Using tracks of 12 leopard
   seals, we calculated first-passage times (indicative of the intensity of
   area-restricted behaviour) and quantified relative habitat use,
   including both foraging and resting areas, using Cox proportional hazard
   models, in relation to coastline, bathymetry and sea ice. We also
   correlated monthly home range size with monthly sea-ice extent. We found
   that when sea-ice extent was low, leopard seals were restricted to
   coastal habitat, but that this effect was lost when sea-ice extent was
   greater. This was supported by the finding that leopard seal home range
   size decreased as the sea-ice extent decreased. Since leopard seals and
   other animals that consume krill are likely to be increasingly limited
   by sea-ice cover if the warming trend continues, we suggest that the
   krill fishery be restricted to offshore areas to avoid conflict with
   krill predators.}},

   response was not readily predicted by baseline behavioral or cortisol
   levels. Also, the chocolate CPP response was positively correlated with
   foraging time, rather than the amount of calories consumed. The sudden
   absence of the food increased exploration, while the chocolate CPP
   effect was associated with vigilance both anxiety-related behaviors in
   marmosets. This behavioral profile occurred regardless of any
   concomitant change or correlation with cortisol. Therefore, the high
   fat/sugar food was more prone to be overly consumed by the marmosets, to
   induce a CPP response and to lead to anxiety-related behavior in its
   absence. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Reproductive state affects hiding behaviour under risk of predation but

Abstract = {{Female investment during reproduction may reduce survivorship due to
   increased predation risk. During pregnancy, the locomotor performance of
   gravid females might be diminished due to the additional weight
   acquired. In addition, egg production may also increase
   thermoregulatoiy, metabolic and physiological costs. Also, pregnant
   females have greater potential fitness and should take fewer risks.
   Thus, females should ponder their reproductive state when considering
   their behavioural responses under risky situations. Here, we examine how
   reproductive state influence risk-taking behaviour in different contexts
   in female Spanish terrapins (Mauremys leprosa). We simulated predator
   attacks of different risk levels and measured the time that the turtles
   spent hiding entirely inside their own shells (i.e. appearance times).
   We also assessed the subsequent time after emergence from the shell that
   the turtles spent immobile monitoring for predators before starting to
   escape actively (i.e. waiting times). Likewise, we performed a
   novel-environment test and measured the exploratory activity of turtles.
   We found no correlations between appearance time, waiting time or
   exploratory activity, but appearance times were correlated across
   different risk levels. Only appearance time was affected by the
   reproductive state, where gravid females reappeared relatively later
   from their shells after a predator attack than non-gravid ones.
   Moreover, among gravid females, those carrying greater clutches tended
   to have longer appearance times. This suggests that only larger clutches
   could affect hiding behaviour in risky contexts. In contrast, waiting
   time spent scanning for predators and exploratory activity were not
   affected by the reproductive state. These differences between gravid and
   non-gravid females might be explained by the metabolic-physiological
   costs associated with egg production and embryo maintenance, as well as
   by the relatively higher potential fitness of gravid females. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In many species, males possess conspicuous characteristics to attract
   females. These traits often attract predators as well, and males thus
   may have to balance the conspicuousness of their signals in relation to
   the prevailing predation risk. Here we develop a theoretical model of
   optimal signaling and risk-taking behavior for males differing in the
   attractiveness of their signals. All else being equal, more attractive
   males should behave more cautiously. Yet this prediction may drastically
   change if males differ in any additional characteristic, especially if
   basal mortality rate or signaling costs are higher or if the
   vulnerability to predators is lower for attractive males. A key insight
   from our model is that male competition will create a positive feedback
   so that selection on male risk-taking strategies is acting in opposite
   directions. If selection acts on one male type to behave more
   cautiously, this will strengthen selection on males of the other types
   to take higher risks and vice versa. Our results further demonstrate
   that the asset-protection principle, which states that individuals with
   higher future expectations should behave more cautiously, may often be
   violated. We also offer an alternative to the handicap principle
   explaining the often found positive association between male
   ornamentation and viability: attractive males may simply behave more
   cautiously.}},

Abstract = {{For several decades, breeding goals in dairy cattle focussed on
   increased milk production. However, many functional traits have negative
   genetic correlations with milk yield, and reductions in genetic merit
   for health and fitness have been observed. Herd management has been
   challenged to compensate for these effects and to balance fertility,
   udder health and metabolic diseases against increased production to
   maximize profit without compromising welfare. Functional traits, such as
   direct information on cow health, have also become more important
   because of growing concern about animal well-being and consumer demands
   for healthy and natural products. There are major concerns about the
   impact of drugs used in veterinary medicine on the spread of
   antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that can negatively impact
   human health. Sustainability and efficiency are also increasingly
   important because of the growing competition for high-quality,
   plant-based sources of energy and protein. Disruptions to global
   environments because of climate change may encourage yet more emphasis
   on these traits. To be successful, it is vital that there be a balance
   between the effort required for data recording and subsequent benefits.
   The motivation of farmers and other stakeholders involved in
   documentation and recording is essential to ensure good data quality. To
   keep labour costs reasonable, existing data sources should be used as
   much as possible. Examples include the use of milk composition data to
   provide additional information about the metabolic status or energy
   balance of the animals. Recent advances in the use of mid-infrared
   spectroscopy to measure milk have shown considerable promise, and may
   provide cost-effective alternative phenotypes for difficult or
   expensive-to-measure traits, such as feed efficiency. There are other
   valuable data sources in countries that have compulsory documentation of
   veterinary treatments and drug use. Additional sources of data outside
   of the farm include, for example, slaughter houses (meat composition and
   quality) and veterinary labs (specific pathogens, viral loads). At the
   farm level, many data are available from automated and semi-automated
   milking and management systems. Electronic devices measuring
   physiological status or activity parameters can be used to predict
   events such as oestrus, and also behavioural traits. Challenges
   concerning the predictive biology of indicator traits or standardization
   need to be solved. To develop effective selection programmes for new
   traits, the development of large databases is necessary so that
   high-reliability breeding values can be estimated. For
   expensive-to-record traits, extensive phenotyping in combination with
   genotyping of females is a possibility.}},

Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{166-173}},

Abstract = {{Adopting different behavioural strategies may reduce within-group
   conflict, selecting for behavioural consistency ('personality').
   Personality may also affect grouping tendencies. The relationship
   between the personality dimensions sociability and boldness nevertheless
   remains unclear. This knowledge gap may reflect a failure to consider
   potential trade-offs between avoiding conspecifics, potentially
   alleviating social stress, and avoiding predation. Furthermore, the
   effects of personality and state (e.g. body condition or age affecting
   the costs and benefits of behavioural actions) on cooperativeness should
   be considered together. This is because state may explain predation
   vulnerability, which may affect boldness under predation risk, and thus
   antipredator grouping tendencies. To address the problem, we determined
   how group size preference and group-forming time depended on boldness
   (flight initiation distance, FID, in response to an approaching human),
   body condition and breeding experience in facultatively social eiders,
   Somateria mollissima, where females form coalitions or care for the
   young solitarily. Breeding adults and young are subject to high
   predation pressure, providing a strong incentive for brood-tending
   females to cooperate. Because hormonal differences may also explain
   differences in sociability, we included baseline and handling-induced
   serum corticosterone concentrations of incubating females as potential
   predictors of sociability. We also statistically controlled for
   availability of potential partners. The relationship between boldness
   (FID) and the number of coalition partners ranged from negative (females
   in poor body condition) to positive (females in good body condition),
   arguing against a uniform relationship between boldness and sociability.
   The number of coalition partners decreased with female breeding
   experience. The time taken to form a coalition was shortest close to the
   hatching peak in the population. Shyness (long FID) delayed group
   formation. Despite a need for safety in numbers by shy females in poor
   body condition, their entry into groups may be constrained by their
   personality, suggesting a possible trade-off between predator and
   conspecific avoidance. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

   whether FTO influences longitudinal trajectories of adiposity and other

   examined whether a commonly carried obesity-risk variant in the FTO gene

Abstract = {{Animals often exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and correlations between behaviors (i.e.,
   behavioral syndromes), yet the causes of those patterns of behavioral
   variation remain insufficiently understood. Many authors hypothesize
   that state-dependent behavior produces animal personality and behavioral
   syndromes. However, empirical studies assessing patterns of covariation
   among behavioral traits and state variables have produced mixed results.
   New statistical methods that partition correlations into
   between-individual and residual within-individual correlations offer an
   opportunity to more sufficiently quantify relationships among behaviors
   and state variables to assess hypotheses of animal personality and
   behavioral syndromes. In a population of wild Belding's ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus beldingi), we repeatedly measured activity, exploration,
   and response to restraint behaviors alongside glucocorticoids and
   nutritional condition. We used multivariate mixed models to determine
   whether between-individual or within-individual correlations drive
   phenotypic relationships among traits. Squirrels had consistent
   individual differences for all five traits. At the between-individual
   level, activity and exploration were positively correlated whereas both
   traits negatively correlated with response to restraint, demonstrating a
   behavioral syndrome. At the within-individual level, condition
   negatively correlated with cortisol, activity, and exploration.
   Importantly, this indicates that although behavior is state-dependent,
   which may play a role in animal personality and behavioral syndromes,
   feedback mechanisms between condition and behavior appear not to produce
   consistent individual differences in behavior and correlations between

Abstract = {{Sulfur is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development.
   Reaching a thorough understanding of the molecular basis for changes in
   plant metabolism depending on the sulfur-nutritional status at the
   systems level will advance our basic knowledge and help target future
   crop improvement. Although the transcriptional responses induced by
   sulfate starvation have been studied in the past, knowledge of the
   regulation of sulfur metabolism is still fragmentary. This work focuses
   on the discovery of candidates for regulatory genes such as
   transcription factors (TFs) using `omics technologies. For this purpose
   a short term sulfate-starvation/re-supply approach was used. ATH1
   microarray studies and metabolite determinations yielded 21 TFs which
   responded more than 2-fold at the transcriptional level to sulfate
   starvation. Categorization by response behaviors under
   sulfate-starvation/re-supply and other nutrient starvations such as
   nitrate and phosphate allowed determination of whether the TF genes are
   specific for or common between distinct mineral nutrient depletions.
   Extending this co-behavior analysis to the whole transcriptome data set
   enabled prediction of putative downstream genes. Additionally,
   combinations of transcriptome and metabolome data allowed identification
   of relationships between TFs and downstream responses, namely,
   expression changes in biosynthetic genes and subsequent metabolic
   responses. Effect chains on glucosinolate and polyamine biosynthesis are
   discussed in detail. The knowledge gained from this study provides a
   blueprint for an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics
   and application for the identification of uncharacterized genes.}},

Abstract = {{The fitness effects of symbionts on their hosts can be

   garden ant Lasius neglectus and its fungal ectosymbiont Laboulbenia
   formicarum for potential costs and benefits. We tested ants with
   different Laboulbenia levels for their survival and immunity under
   resource limitation and exposure to the obligate killing entomopathogen
   Metarhizium brunneum. While survival of L. neglectus workers under
   starvation was significantly decreased with increasing Laboulbenia
   levels, host survival under Metarhizium exposure increased with higher
   levels of the ectosymbiont, suggesting a symbiont-mediated anti-pathogen
   protection, which seems to be driven mechanistically by both improved
   sanitary behaviours and an upregulated immune system. Ants with high
   Laboulbenia levels showed significantly longer self-grooming and
   elevated expression of immune genes relevant for wound repair and
   antifungal responses (beta-1,3-glucan binding protein,
   Prophenoloxidase), compared with ants carrying low Laboulbenia levels.
   This suggests that the ectosymbiont Laboulbenia formicarum weakens its
   ant host by either direct resource exploitation or the costs of an
   upregulated behavioural and immunological response, which, however,
   provides a prophylactic protection upon later exposure to pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Health and safety is based on the choices that people make during
   lifetime. Each of us chooses to act safely or unsafely, healthy or
   unhealthy. Specific risk group is children and youngsters. Children and
   young people often have a desire to test their independence, build a
   personal identity and expand the social life, so young people often
   experiment also with different types of behavior. In the situations not
   favorable to health and safety children and young people behavior often
   do not comply with their knowledge of how to act. Human (human
   securitability is an internationally-known concept that characterizes
   human adaptability skills in a rapidly changing environment. Are
   distinguished 7 human securitability aspects: health, economic, personal
   (physical), ecological securitability, nutritional, community and
   political securitability. In the National development plan (NDP) 2020
   strategy one of the priorities is human securitability provision. In our
   study, we analyzed the personal (physical) securitability of educational
   institutions. A person with a low sense of securitability feels
   threatened, does not want to use the opportunities of personal growth,
   trust others and cooperate with them at workplace and in collectives,
   does not want to participate in the state national development process,
   and therefore does not contribute to national growth. The pupils are
   able to learn successfully at school, develop their ability to form a
   personality only in an environment with a sustainable securitability.
   The pupil parents can successfully work and act only in the case they
   are absolutely certain about their children securitability at school,
   where they spend most of the working day: at schools, in after-school
   hobby groups, in sports trainings. Creating a safe environment at
   schools and being educated, growing and developing in this environment,
   the pupils form understanding of the necessity for a safe and healthy
   environment and its importance, and develop motivation to keep it for
   the needs of family, society and the public.
   In strengthening securitability equally important is knowledge and
   skills to act in different situations. Researching education policy
   documents, the authors draw the conclusion that it is necessary on a
   state level to strengthen the securitability of each Latvian resident
   and the issues related to state securitability in educational
   institutions and society as a whole. Sports teacher can contribute to
   the promotion of pupil securitability, using the subject content as the
   means. Human securitability can be promoted by knowledge acquisition and
   skills development in securitability-oriented sports lesson.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the literature of Chateaubriand, which, nourished
   by the labyrinth of his life experience, is the image of the life rich
   in events of the author. Francois Rene Viscount of Chateaubriand is
   remembered by the most important literary stories as the man with three
   careers: first voyager, then diplomat and finally, memoirist, all three
   having fertilized his inspiration and his sensitivity. If it's the
   fabulous voyage in America that inspired the epic American of the
   Natchez in his famous novels ``Atala{''}, ``Rene{''} and ``Natchez{''},
   the future diplomat most of all, and especially the deep and
   conservative Christian who Chateaubriand has always been, produced the
   ``Genius of Christianity{''}, which brings him not only Bonaparte's
   partial acceptation, but also the recognition of an entire century which
   sees him as the personality that has made possible the return of the
   Christian religion into the artistic inspiration, after the Greek and
   Roman inspiration Pantheism of the classicism, and the ``terror{''} in
   the time of the Revolution. But it's for the memoirist producing his
   masterpiece ``Memoires d'outre-tombe{''} to open, at the same time, the
   way to the most important themes of romanticism, to romantic description
   and to romantic poetry. Even if it's a piece in prose, thanks to the
   sensitive and quiet rhythm of the sentence and the assonance games, and
   also thanks to the use of metaphors and similes, I can assert that we
   are in the presence of a true piece of poetic prose. In addition, we
   have here an explicit description of space, in contrast to poetry itself
   where space appears only implicitly. Chateaubriand's description
   contains the three fundamental themes that are haunting and defining for
   the romantics: nature, glory of the past (history) and myth. The same
   themes are taken up and developed with even more refinement (with the
   weapons of poetry), in what interests me the most, which is his poetic
   work, unrecognized and ignored by the most important critics. God,
   nature, travel, history and myth, all of them blend in poems such as:
   ``Painting of God{''}, ``The Forest{''}, ``The Slave{''}, whose eternal
   value I try to demonstrate in this study.}},

Title = {{Responses of Tree-killing Bark Beetles to a Changing Climate}},
Booktitle = {{CLIMATE CHANGE AND INSECT PESTS}},
Series = {{CABI Climate Change Series}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{173-201}},
Abstract = {{Bark beetles cause widespread tree mortality, so understanding how
   climate change will influence the distribution and magnitude of
   outbreaks by this group of herbivores is important. We first develop a
   framework of outbreak dynamics that emphasizes transitions from states
   dominated by negative feedback to those dominated by positive,
   density-dependent feedback. We then consider mechanisms by which
   temperature and precipitation changes can allow populations to breach
   critical thresholds, and the empirical data relating outbreaks to
   weather. Finally, we consider how anticipated climatic change, and
   relationships with new hosts and natural enemy guilds, may influence
   dynamics in new habitats. There is strong evidence that elevated
   temperature can increase over-wintering survival and decrease generation
   times of bark beetles, although evolved traits can also constrain
   response to warming in some habitats. Moreover, combinations of
   phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation and physiological thresholds
   yield a broad range of conditions under which adults emerge
   synchronously, and thus can mass attack trees. There is likewise strong
   evidence that severe drought reduces tree defences against attack.
   Drought stress can occur through lower precipitation and/or higher
   temperatures that reduce soil moisture and/or raise vapour pressure
   deficit. We also delineate three categories of range modifications:
   increased and more persistent establishment in areas where trees
   experienced only intermittent exposure historically; establishment in
   areas dominated by host species but where local populations experienced
   little or no pressure historically; and movement into new areas
   containing susceptible species that have not been exposed previously.
   Each of these has been documented for bark beetles. Trees in areas that
   experienced minor or no exposure generally had lower defences than their
   more historically exposed counterparts. However, there can be lags in
   beetle behavioural responses. In some cases, more heterogeneous forest
   structure, more abundant local predators and competitors and low host
   nutritional quality could potentially lessen risk in new habitats.
   Direct comparative studies are needed to evaluate outbreak potentials
   following range expansions driven by climate warming.}},

Title = {{Building school connectedness through shared lunches}},
Journal = {{HEALTH EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{554-569}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - School connectedness is a well-established protective factor
   for young people's physical, mental, and social health. The purpose of
   this paper is to explore the promotion of school connectedness through
   the practice of shared lunches within a secondary school context in New
   Zealand.
   Design/methodology/approach - An ethnographic methodology was used to
   explore in-depth the mechanisms by which food practices included
   indicators of school connectedness, and used interviews and observations
   with teachers and 16-18-year-old students in a New Zealand secondary
   school.
   Findings - The results describe six key mechanisms by which shared
   lunches fostered school connectedness: showing common humanity, creating
   an informal setting, encouraging sharing, enabling inclusive
   participation, demonstrating sacrifice for the communal good, and
   facilitating experiences of diversity. These mechanisms contributed to
   increased social interactions in which people got to know each other
   better and were able to gain insight into others' personalities. This
   allowed for opportunities to establish and strengthen social
   relationships, and contributed to indicators of connectedness.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is exploratory with
   findings reported from one school. Further research in other contexts on
   the value of shared lunches for building school connectedness is
   required.
   Originality/value - Shared lunches, as part of an overall strategy to
   develop a well-connected school community, are adaptable and can fit
   into a multitude of situations to meet different needs. The findings of
   this study contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which shared
   lunches can affect indicators of school connectedness.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{518-533}},
Abstract = {{African-American women experience disproportionately higher rates of
   obesity than do Caucasian women. The stress African-American women
   encounter from experiences of discrimination may influence their eating
   behaviours, which could contribute to weight gain. Emotional eating
   theory suggests some people increase their intake of high-calorie foods
   to cope with stressful experiences. We investigated the effects of
   social exclusion by other African-American women or by Caucasian women
   for African-American women's distress and food consumption using a
   laboratory paradigm. As hypothesised, there were main effects of
   ostracism and interactions between ostracism and race, although not all
   of the interactions took the expected form. As hypothesised,
   African-American women ate more potato crisps after being excluded by
   Caucasians than by African-Americans. Unexpectedly, African-American
   women who were excluded by other African-American women self-reported
   more emotional distress than did African-American women excluded by
   Caucasian women. These findings suggest that ostracism by both in-group
   and out-group members are disturbing, although people may respond to
   in-group and out-group exclusion in different ways. Directions for
   future research are suggested that could elucidate the circumstances
   under which different emotional and behavioural coping responses are
   employed.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Translate the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for
   Exercise questionnaire, adapt it cross-culturally and identify the
   psychometric properties of the psychosocial scales for physical activity
   in young university students.
   METHODS: The Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise
   questionnaire is made up of 39 items divided into constructs based on
   the social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model. The analyzed
   constructs were, as follows: behavior change strategy (15 items),
   decision-making process (10), self-efficacy (6), support from family
   (4), and support from friends (4). The validation procedures were
   conceptual, semantic, operational, and functional equivalences, in
   addition to the equivalence of the items and of measurements. The
   conceptual, of items and semantic equivalences were performed by a
   specialized committee. During measurement equivalence, the instrument
   was applied to 717 university students. Exploratory factor analysis was
   used to verify the loading of each item, explained variance and internal
   consistency of the constructs. Reproducibility was measured by means of
   intraclass correlation coefficient.
   RESULTS: The two translations were equivalent and back-translation was
   similar to the original version, with few adaptations. The layout,
   presentation order of the constructs and items from the original version
   were kept in the same form as the original instrument. The sample size
   was adequate and was evaluated by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test, with
   values between 0.72 and 0.91. The correlation matrix of the items
   presented r < 0.8 (p < 0.05). The factor loadings of the items from all
   the constructs were satisfactory (> 0.40), varying between 0.43 and
   0.80, which explained between 45.4\% and 59.0\% of the variance.
   Internal consistency was satisfactory (alpha >= 0.70), with support from
   friends being 0.70 and 0.92 for self-efficacy. Most items (74.3\%)
   presented values above 0.70 for the reproducibility test.
   CONCLUSIONS: The validation process steps were considered satisfactory
   and adequate for applying to the population.}},

Abstract = {{Eating is a risky affair. All animals have to offset risks of feeding

   may not be for another. This evidence suggests that factors previously
   assumed to be constraints in Optimal Foraging Theory, Functional

   the day hospital for the treatment of neurotic and behavioral disorders.
   Material and method. Symptoms Checklist KO{''}O{''} and Life Inventory
   completed by 461 women and 219 men treated with intensive integrative
   psychotherapy with predominance of psychodynamic approach in the day
   hospital due to neurotic, behavioral and personality disorders between
   2005-2013. Percentages of patients reporting SI initially and at the end
   of the treatment were 29.1\% and 10.2\% respectively in women and 36.5\%
   and 13.7\% in men. The improvement in terms of initially reported SI was
   obtained by 84.3\% of women and 77.5\% of men. Among patients, those
   initially reporting SI were characterized by greater intensity of
   neurotic symptoms (p<0.001) and greater intensity of nearly all of 14
   subtypes of neurotic symptoms(p<0.05).
   Results. Among those reporting SI, subgroups of women with greater
   intensity of Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p=0.003), Neurasthenia
   (p=0.005), Autonomic disorders (p=0.044) and women reporting episodes of
   uncontrollable hunger (p<0.01) had significantly lower chances of
   improvement in terms of SI than others.
   Conclusions. Patients initially reporting SI constituted approximately
   1/3 in both genders and were characterized by greater intensity of
   neurotic disorders. Among those, women with particularly higher
   intensity of Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, Neurasthenia and Autonomic
   disorders and women reporting episodes of uncontrollable hunger seemed
   to suffer from SI that were more resistant to the psychotherapy. As
   such, those subgroups of women require special attention and diligent

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Telomere biology plays a fundamental role in genomic
   integrity and cell physiology. The newborn setting of telomere length
   (TL) likely has important implications for telomere dynamics over the
   lifespan; however, its determinants are poorly understood. Folate is
   essential for DNA integrity. The maternal compartment is the only source
   of folate for the developing fetus. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis
   that variation in maternal folate during pregnancy is associated with
   newborn TL. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted in
   119 mother-newborn dyads. Eligible mothers were enrolled at 9.5 (SD +/-
   2.1) weeks gestation and followed through birth. Concentrations of
   maternal serum folate were measured in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   Newborn telomere length was measured in cord blood mononuclear cells
   (CBMC). Results: After accounting for the effects of other established
   determinants of newborn TL, each 10 ng/ml increase in maternal total
   folate was associated with a 5.8\% increase in median TL (p = 0.03). The
   median TL in newborns of mother in the lowest quartile of total folate
   levels was approximately 10\% shorter than that of newborns of mothers
   in the highest folate quartile. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that
   fetal TL exhibits developmental plasticity, and provide evidence that
   maternal nutrition may exert a `programming' effect on this system. (C)

   One hundred percent minimum convex polygon areas decreased by 37\% on
   average, and 95\% and 50\% kernel density contour ranges decreased by

Abstract = {{Introduction: In Portugal, there are no representative data on how many
   people are actively trying to control their weight and which strategies
   and motives underlie those attempts. The aim of this study was to
   estimate the prevalence of weight loss/maintenance attempts and to
   identify the associated behavioral strategies and motives, in a
   representative sample of Portuguese adults.
   Material and Methods: Cross-sectional study with a sample of 1098
   Portuguese adults. Sociodemographic information, anthropometric data and
   weight loss/maintenance strategies and motives were assessed by
   telephone interview.
   Results: About 44\% of Portuguese adults (53\% women and 35\% men) are
   actively trying to control their weight. About 22\% of women with normal
   weight are trying to lose weight while 53\% of men and 34\% of women
   with excess weight are not trying to manage their weight. About 49\% of
   men with higher educational level are trying to control their weight,
   which compares to 32\% among the least educated men. The most frequently
   used strategy to manage weight is regular vegetable consumption and the
   motives most frequently reported were improving health/preventing
   diseases and improving wellbeing.
   Discussion and Conclusion: More than half of Portuguese women and about
   one-third of men are actively trying to control their weight, using
   behavioral strategies which are generally consistent with public health
   recommendations. The predominant motives are related to improving health
   and wellbeing. This study contributes to understanding weight management

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Periconceptional environment may influence embryo development,
   ultimately affecting adult health. Here, we review the rodent model of
   maternal low-protein diet specifically during the preimplantation period
   (Emb-LPD) with normal nutrition during subsequent gestation and
   postnatally. This model, studied mainly in the mouse, leads to
   cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural disease in adult offspring,
   with females more susceptible. We evaluate the sequence of events from
   diet administration that may lead to adult disease. Emb-LPD changes
   maternal serum and/or uterine fluid metabolite composition, notably with
   reduced insulin and branched-chain amino acids. This is sensed by
   blastocysts through reduced mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
   signalling. Embryos respond by permanently changing the pattern of
   development of their extra-embryonic lineages, trophectoderm and
   primitive endoderm, to enhance maternal nutrient retrieval during
   subsequent gestation. These compensatory changes include stimulation in
   proliferation, endocytosis and cellular motility, and epigenetic
   mechanisms underlying them are being identified. Collectively, these
   responses act to protect fetal growth and likely contribute to offspring
   competitive fitness. However, the resulting growth adversely affects
   long-term health because perinatal weight positively correlates with
   adult disease risk. We argue that periconception environmental responses
   reflect developmental plasticity and `decisions' made by embryos to
   optimise their own development, but with lasting consequences.}},

Title = {{The clinical basis of orthorexia nervosa: emerging perspectives}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{385-394}},
Abstract = {{Orthorexia nervosa describes a pathological obsession with proper
   nutrition that is characterized by a restrictive diet, ritualized
   patterns of eating, and rigid avoidance of foods believed to be
   unhealthy or impure. Although prompted by a desire to achieve optimum
   health, orthorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies, medical
   complications, and poor quality of life. Despite its being a distinct
   behavioral pattern that is frequently observed by clinicians, orthorexia
   has received very little empirical attention and is not yet formally
   recognized as a psychiatric disorder. In this review, we synthesize
   existing research to identify what is known about the symptoms,
   prevalence, neuropsychological profile, and treatment of orthorexia. An
   examination of diagnostic boundaries reveals important points of symptom
   overlap between orthorexia and anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD),
   somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and psychotic
   spectrum disorders. Neuropsychological data suggest that orthorexic
   symptoms are independently associated with key facets of executive
   dysfunction for which some of these conditions already overlap.
   Discussion of cognitive weaknesses in set-shifting, external attention,
   and working memory highlights the value of continued research to
   identify intermediate, transdiagnostic endophenotypes for insight into
   the neuropathogenesis of orthorexia. An evaluation of current orthorexia
   measures indicates a need for further psychometric development to ensure
   that subsequent research has access to reliable and valid assessment
   tools. Optimized assessment will not only permit a clearer understanding
   of prevalence rates, psychosocial risk factors, and comorbid
   psychopathology but will also be needed to index intervention
   effectiveness. Though the field lacks data on therapeutic outcomes,
   current best practices suggest that orthorexia can successfully be
   treated with a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy,
   psychoeducation, and medication.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Overweight and obesity are serious public health problem,
   which is specially among children populations.
   Objective: To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions
   conducted in Latino America for the prevention of overweight and obesity
   in scholar children from 6 to 17 years old.
   Metodology: MEDLINE, LILACS and EMBASE were searched between february
   and may 2014 to retrieve randomized controlled trials and longitudinal
   studies that evaluated the effects of educational interventions intended
   to retrieve randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies aiming
   to prevent overweight and obesity among Latinoamerican children. Risk of
   bias was evaluated using the PEDro scale and the CASPe tool.
   Results: Twenty one studies were included (n=12,092). Different types of
   educational interventions were identified, such as nutritional
   campaigns, physical activity practice and environmental changes. Mixed
   approaches combining nutritional campaigns, physical activity promotion
   and enviromental changes were the most effective interventions, since
   their results produced the largest improvements in the overweight and
   obesity of children. None evidence of reporting bias was observed.
   Conclusion: Educational interventions performed in the educational
   environment that combined an adequate nutrition and the promotion of
   physical activity practice, are more effective for preventing overweight
   and obesity in Latino American children, although familiar interventions
   are also encouraged approach, associated with better responses on the
   behavioral change in scholar children.}},

Abstract = {{Plants secrete extrafloral nectar (EFN) as an induced defense against
   herbivores. EFN contains not only carbohydrates and amino acids but also
   pathogenesis-related proteins and other protective enzymes, making EFN
   an exclusive reward. EFN secretion is commonly induced after wounding,
   likely owing to a jasmonic acid-induced cell wall invertase, and is
   limited by phloem sucrose availability: Both factors control EFN
   secretion according to the optimal defense hypothesis. Non-ant EFN
   consumers include parasitoids, wasps, spiders, mites, bugs, and
   predatory beetles. Little is known about the relevance of EFN to the
   nutrition of its consumers and, hence, to the structuring of arthropod
   communities. The mutualism can be established quickly among noncoevolved
   (e.g., invasive) species, indicating its easy assembly is due to
   ecological fitting. Therefore, increasing efforts are directed toward
   using EFN in biocontrol. However, documentation of the importance of EFN
   for the communities of plants and arthropods in natural, invasive, and
   agricultural ecosystems is still limited.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all Americans (97\%) report eating candy at least once per year;
   yet, on a given day, only approximately one-fourth of the US population
   aged >= 2 y consumes candy. Among all Americans, candy contributes a
   relatively small proportion of calories, added sugars, and saturated fat
   to the total diet, and recent research suggests that current levels of
   candy consumption are not associated with risk of weight gain and
   cardiovascular disease in children and adults. Providing guidance for
   the consumption of candy in moderation requires an understanding of
   various behavioral health-related factors that influence candy
   consumption. A roundtable of behavioral nutrition experts, researchers,
   and nutrition educators met to discuss recent data on intakes of candy,
   health outcomes associated with usual candy intake, and the impact of
   behavioral strategies, including restriction, education, and
   environmental awareness, on modifying eating behaviors to achieve
   moderate intakes of candy. Restricting access to palatable foods,
   whether self-imposed or by parental control, may have potentially
   negative consequences. Techniques and insight into how to adopt
   ``moderation{''} in candy consumption, from effective parental practices
   to environmental strategies that facilitate behavior change without a
   high degree of effort, were identified as important next steps toward
   sustainable dietary guidance related to the role of candy and other

Abstract = {{Interactions with environmental parameters may alter the ecotoxicity of
   nanoparticles. The present study therefore assessed the (in)direct
   effects of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) towards Gammarus
   fossarum, considering nano-TiO2's photocatalytic properties at ambient
   UV-intensities. Gammarids' habitat selection was investigated using its
   feeding preference on leaf discs either exposed to or protected from
   UV-irradiation in presence of nano-TiO2 as proxy (n = 49).
   UV-irradiation alone induced a significant preference for UV-protected
   habitats, which was more pronounced in simultaneous presence of
   nano-TiO2. This behaviour may be mainly explained by the UV-induced
   formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nano-TiO2. Besides their
   direct toxicity, ROS may have lowered the leaf-quality in UV-exposed
   areas contributing (approximately 30\%) to the observed behavioural
   pattern. Since the predicted no effect concentration of nano-TiO2 in
   combination with UVirradiation falls below the predicted environmental
   concentration this study underpins the importance of considering
   environmental parameters during the risk assessment of nanoparticles.

Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A trophic niche shift can occur as an adaptive response to environmental
   change such as altered resource quality, abundance or composition.
   Alterations in digestive traits such as gut morphology and physiology
   may enable these niche shifts and affect the persistence of populations
   and species. Relatively few studies, however, have assessed how niche
   shifts influence suites of digestive traits through phenotypic
   plasticity and evolutionary mechanisms, and how these trait changes can
   subsequently alter the nutrition, fitness and life history of organisms.
   We investigated how population divergence and plasticity alter the gut
   physiology of wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), assessing
   whether variation in digestive traits correspond with enhanced nutrient
   assimilation under a pronounced dietary shift. We examined gut enzyme
   activity, and gut size and mass of wild guppies from both high-predation
   (HP) and low-predation (LP) habitats when reared in the laboratory and
   fed on high- or low-quality diets designed to reflect their dietary
   differences previously found in nature. After 10 weeks on the
   experimental diets, HP guppies maintained shorter and lighter guts than
   LP guppies on either diet. Guppies also differed in their digestive
   enzymatic profiles, more often reflecting nutrient balancing so that
   increased enzyme expression tended to correspond with more deficient
   nutrients in the diet. LP guppies had increased somatic phosphorus at
   the end of the experiment, possibly related to the higher alkaline
   phosphatase activity in their guts. Our results suggest that differences
   in gut physiology exist among populations of Trinidadian guppies that
   may reflect local adaptation to their disparate environments.}},

Abstract = {{Predators attack and plants defend, so herbivores face the dilemma of
   how to eat enough without being eaten. But do differences in the
   personality of herbivores affect the foraging choices of individuals? We
   explored the ecological impact of personality in a generalist herbivore,
   the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). After quantifying
   personality traits in wild individuals brought temporarily into
   captivity, we tested how these traits altered foraging by individuals
   when free-ranging in their natural habitat. To measure their responses
   to the dual costs of predation risk and plant toxin, we varied the toxin
   concentration of food in safe foraging patches against paired, non-toxic
   risky patches, and used a novel synthesis of a manipulative
   Giving-Up-Density (GUD) experiment and video behavioural analysis. At
   the population level, the cost of safe patches pivoted around that of
   risky patches depending on food toxin concentration. At the individual
   level, boldness affected foraging at risky high-quality food patches (as
   behavioural differences between bold and shy), and at safe patches only
   when food toxin concentration was low (as differences in foraging
   outcome). Our results ecologically validate the personality trait of
   boldness, in brushtail possums. They also reveal, for the first time, a
   nuanced link between personality and the way in which individuals
   balance the costs of food and fear. Importantly, they suggest that high
   plant defence effectively attenuates differences in foraging behaviour
   arising from variation in personality, but poorly defended plants in
   safe areas should be differentially subject to herbivory depending on
   the personality of the herbivore.}},

Abstract = {{Intuitive eating is an adaptive dietary behavior that emphasizes eating
   in response to physiological hunger and satiety cues. The Intuitive
   Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) measures such attitudes and behaviors. The aim of
   the present study was to adapt the IES-2 to the French context and to
   test its psychometric properties in 335 women and 297 men participating
   in the NutriNet-Sante study. We evaluated the construct validity of the
   IES-2 by testing hypotheses with regard to its factor structure,
   relationships with scores of the revised 21-item Three Factor Eating
   Questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale,
   and differences between ``a priori{''} relevant subgroups. First, the
   exploratory factor analysis revealed three main dimensions: Eating for
   Physical Rather than Emotional Reasons, Reliance on Hunger and Satiety
   Cues, and Unconditional Permission to Eat. Second-order confirmatory
   factor analysis upheld the 3-factor solution influenced by a broader
   intuitive eating dimension. IES-2 total score was negatively related to
   cognitive restraint (r = -031, P < 0.0001), emotional eating (r =-0.58,
   P < 0.0001), uncontrolled eating (r = -0.40, P < 0.0001), and depressive
   symptoms (r = -0.20, P <0.0001). IES-2 subscales showed similar
   correlations. Women had lower scores than did men for the IES-2 total
   scale (3.3 in women vs. 3.5 in men, P < 0.0001), Eating for Physical
   Reasons, and Unconditional Permission to Eat subscales. Current or
   former dieters had lower scores on the IES-2 total scale and on all
   subscales than did those who had never dieted (all P < 0.01). Finally,
   results showed satisfactory reliability for the IES-2 total scores
   (internal consistency = 0.85 and test-retest reliability = 0.79 over a
   mean 8-week period) and for its subscales. Thus, the French IES-2 can be
   considered a useful instrument for assessing adult intuitive eating
   behaviors in empirical and epidemiological studies in the general

Abstract = {{Life-history trade-offs are considered a major driving force in the

   personality trait (escape response), life-history and state variables
   (growth rate, size and age at first reproduction, age-dependent
   reproductive rates, lifetime reproductive success, life span) in red and
   green colour morphs of clonal pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Escape
   response (dropping/non-dropping off a plant upon a predatory attack) was
   measured repeatedly to classify individuals as consistent droppers,
   consistent nondroppers or inconsistents. Red morphs experienced stronger
   trade-offs between early reproduction and life span than green morphs;

   success. Red droppers followed a risk-averse life-history strategy (high
   late reproduction), red nondroppers a risk-prone strategy (high early
   reproduction), while reproductive rates were equivalent for all green
   behavioural types and red inconsistents. This suggests that red morphs
   suffer the highest costs of dropping (they are most conspicuous to
   predators), which equivalates' fitness payoffs to both risk-takers (red
   non-droppers) and risk-averse red droppers. The strong trade-off also
   means that committing to a particular lifestyle (being consistent)
   maximises fitness. Our study suggests that life-history trade-offs
   likely mediate personality variation but effects might depend on
   interactions with other organismal characteristics (here: colour morph).}},

Abstract = {{Tadpoles of Sphaerotheca breviceps detect food and predators using
   waterborne chemical cues (odours), which evoke appropriate behaviour.
   The present study aimed to determine whether they are capable of
   resolving the conflict between foraging choice and predator avoidance on
   encountering both food and predatory chemical cues together. Experiments
   were designed using an association choice apparatus in which prey
   tadpoles were given a choice to move themselves close to or away from a
   given stimulus (food or a predator). Food odours were either strong or
   weak. Tadpoles of Hoplobatrachus tigerinus (n = 4) were placed in an
   open-ended mesh cage wrapped in a cheese cloth that provided predator
   cues. The time spent by the test tadpoles in the predator's zone or away
   from it and the time spent feeding were recorded for 10 min (n = 25
   trials). When food odours were weak, the prey tadpoles avoided predators
   and spent significantly more time in the predator-free zone. In
   contrast, when food odours were strong, they foraged equally in the two
   zones of the test apparatus regardless of the presence or absence of
   predators. These findings confirm the inherent ability of S. breviceps
   tadpoles to distinguish between food and predators, and indicate that

Abstract = {{Vigilance in prey species can serve many purposes, including predator
   detection and monitoring other group members, and is generally thought
   to impose a cost due to reduced food intake. However, previous studies
   have shown that herbivores are able to reduce the foraging cost of
   vigilance by chewing their food during vigilance bouts ('vigilance with
   chewing', as compared to `vigilance without chewing'). How predation
   risk, food availability and competition affect both the functions and
   the foraging costs of vigilance remains an open question. We studied
   female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, during winter and
   summer, when available food supplies were poor and rich, respectively,
   to investigate how group size, distance to cover, proximity between
   foragers and food patch quality affected decisions of foraging female
   kangaroos to exhibit antipredator or social vigilance, distinguishing
   vigilance with and without chewing. The use of antipredator vigilance
   was mainly driven by the perception of predation risk, and antipredator
   vigilance without chewing decreased with increased group size whereas
   antipredator vigilance with chewing increased nonlinearly with group
   size in winter. Distance to cover affected both forms of antipredator
   vigilance in summer only but there was no effect of nearest-neighbour
   distance. Social vigilance was affected positively by group size, and
   distance between foragers affected social vigilance without chewing
   positively, particularly in winter, and social vigilance with chewing
   negatively. Finally, patch quality increased the use of social vigilance
   with chewing in both seasons and decreased the use of antipredator
   vigilance with chewing in winter. This study provides new information on
   how animals make decisions about the functions and foraging costs of
   vigilance and allows a better understanding of how social foragers
   respond to an ever-changing environment. (C) 2014 The Association for

Abstract = {{Limited Editions are a widely used type of line extensions. An
   exceptional, limited available variant is added to the permanent product
   line offers. Whereas Limited Editions look back on a long tradition in
   high involvement categories, recently, they have been increasingly used
   in Fast-Moving-Consumer-Goods (FMCG) categories. For example, in the
   U.S. food and beverage sector the number of yearly Limited Edition
   launches increased from 2001 to 2004 by 87\% (Banasiak 2005). In spite
   of their high practical relevance, no scientific discussion about the
   effects of Limited Editions on the consumers exists. Some authors have
   proposed possible effects, like positive feedback effect on parent
   brands, but their theoretical foundation and empirical discussion is
   lacking. The objective of this study was to theoretically explain and
   empirically test the essential variables and their interrelations
   characterizing the consumers' evaluation of Limited Editions.
   There are two different approaches which can be used to explain the
   evaluation of Limited Editions. On the one hand, personality traits like
   exploration tendency can moderate the evaluation. Exploration tendency
   helps to regulate arousal and result from the motivation for stimulation
   seeking (Raju 1980). It was supposed that two different optimal
   stimulation levels exist (Hebb 1955; Maier, Vickers and Inman 2007).
   Exploration seekers show a high optimum, they search more likely for
   stimulation than exploration avoiders, who are characterised by a lower
   optimum level and a preference for familiar stimuli (Baumgartner and
   Steenkamp 1996). On the other hand, limited availability of a product
   produces a scarcity effect. This effect refers to a powerful persuasion
   principle. Because valuable objects are often scarce, consumers tend to
   perceive scarce objects as more attractive (Cialdini, 1993). There is a
   controversy between different psychological approaches to explain
   scarcity effects regarding the question whether scarcity can take effect
   automatically, without a deep elaboration, or a deeper processing is
   necessary (Lynn, 1992; Cialdini, 1993). Categorization theory
   considerations provide conclusions about reciprocal effects of limited
   editions towards the parent brand. This process includes the
   identification of an object as a member of an object class based on
   similarities (Rosch and Mervis 1975). Assimilation effects occur if a
   product is successfully identified as a member of a brand's category
   (Fiske and Neuberg 1990). Characteristics of the product become an
   integral part of the brand's mental representation and lead to brand's
   image change (Loken and Roedder John 1993).
   A series of three experiments was carried out to examine the following
   research questions: (1) In what way does the effect of product
   limitation, which is characteristic for Limited Editions, depend on the
   exploration tendency of the consumers? (2) In what way does the depth of
   processing influence the effect of a Limited Edition? (3) What kind of
   reciprocal effects on the parent brand launching a Limited Edition are
   expected? Three experiments were conducted in form of standardized
   interviews with a total of 511 subjects. They were exposed to product
   boards from the categories deep-frozen pizza, ice cream and biscuits.
   The evaluation of collected data took place through analyses of
   variance. Our experimental results give a deeper insight into the
   question how Limited Editions work in FMCG context. We have found that
   the effect of a product limitation is substantially moderated by the
   level of exploration seeking. For FMCG, consumers use a ``scarce =
   novel{''} heuristic. Customers deduce the unique character of the
   product from its limited availability. However, the reinforcing effect
   of limitation on product attitude and trial interest arises only in case
   of exploration seekers, which are characterized by a pronounced need for
   stimulation through exceptional products. Further, the results confirmed
   the relevance of cognitive effort for the scarcity effect to take place
   in FMCG context. Only in case of deeper processing a limitation label
   led to a more positive attitude towards the product and trial interest.
   Moreover, reciprocal effects of a Limited Edition launch on the parent
   brand could be observed. Assimilation between Limited Edition and parent
   brand was evident. Launching a Limited Edition heightens the perceived
   creativity of the parent brand, independent of brand strength. A
   positive effect on the brand attitude was found only for a weak parent
   brand.
   Several practical implications can be drawn. Before a company decides to
   use this strategy, exploration tendency of the target group should be
   examined. Furthermore, our results underline the impact of limited
   availability. To achieve a scarcity effect, consumers should recognize
   the limitation. Additionally, a deeper consideration of a Limited
   Edition by consumers positively impacts the evaluation. During and after
   launch, in-store merchandising can be carried out which help to attract
   consumers' attention. Finally, it has been found that the parent brand
   can profit from the reciprocal effects of a Limited Edition. This is an
   effective strategy for brands which aim to increase the perceived brand
   creativity.}},

Abstract = {{Public bicycle system is considered as an essential part of the public
   transport system in large and medium cities owing to its zero emissions
   and accessibility. This study was undertaken to establish a conceptual
   framework for describing the behavioral intention of using public
   bicycle. A structural equation model was then employed to formulate the
   relationship between individual's behavioral intention of using public
   bicycle and its influencing factors. A set of questionnaires was
   designed and 202 citizens in Wuhan were interviewed in order to collect
   the required data for empirical study purpose. The study results
   indicate that the behavioral intention of using public bicycle is
   influenced not only by the satisfaction towards biking environments and
   the perceived degree of security and risks, the attitude towards public
   bicycle and social personality also plays an important role. For
   inspiring an individual's willingness to using public bicycle, improving
   the quality of biking environments is a short cut for encouraging people
   to using public bicycle. The long-term approach for promoting green
   transportation is to nourish the right attitude toward public bicycle,
   and thus promote the development of public transportation system.}},

Abstract = {{Species abundances and distributions are inherently tied to individuals'
   decisions about movement within their habitat. Therefore, integrating
   individual phenotypic variation within a larger ecological framework may
   provide better insight into how populations structure themselves. Recent
   evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour prompts the
   hypothesis that variation in behavioural types might be related to
   variation in movement in natural environments. In a multiyear
   mark-recapture study, we found that individual sticklebacks exhibited
   consistent individual differences in behaviour both within a
   standardized testing arena designed to measure exploratory behaviour and
   within a river. Therefore, we asked whether individual differences in
   movement in a natural river were related to an individual's exploratory
   behavioural type. We also considered whether body condition and/or the
   individual's habitat or social environment use was related to movement.
   There was no evidence that an individual's exploratory behavioural type
   was related to movement within the river. Instead, an individual's
   habitat use and body condition interacted to influence natural movement
   patterns. Individuals in good condition were more likely to move further
   in the river, but only if they inhabited a vegetated complex part of the
   river; body condition had no influence on movement in those individuals
   inhabiting open areas of the river. Our results suggest that individual
   traits could help improve predictions about how populations may
   distribute themselves within patchy and complex environments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is usual to attribute to adolescence the physical,
   psychological, cognitive and sociocultural transformations that
   contribute to the formation of personality, and that expose adolescents
   to new life contexts that lead to acquiring behaviours, habits and
   lifestyle which are determinants of their health in adulthood. On the
   other hand, in the school environment, it is recommended that the
   youngsters study and achieve academic performance.
   Objectives: Our aim is to identify factors associated with adolescents'
   academic performance, including socio-demographic, school and academic
   context variables, to analyse the influence that the lifestyles
   (physical activity, tobacco, drug and alcohol consumption, nutrition
   habits, leisure activities, hygiene and health promotion habits, risk
   and road safety behaviour, sleep and rest habits) may have in predicting
   adolescents' quality of academic performance and to analyse the
   relationship these variables establish among themselves.
   Participants and Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive,
   correlational, explanatory, and retrospective study. The survey, through
   a directly administered questionnaire, and academic performance scale
   (Fermin, 2005) instruments were selected for the data collection. A
   non-probability convenience sample consisting of 380 adolescents
   attending the 7th, 8th and 9th years in the 2011/2012academic year, from
   a 2nd {[}up to the 6th year] and 3rd {[}up to the 9th year] cycle school
   in Viseu, Portugal was used.
   Results: Girls, younger students, those living in rural areas, those
   with a higher socioeconomic status, those who have a parent with
   secondary or higher education are classified as better students. They
   are also the adolescents with fewer years of education, those who have
   never failed, those living closest to the school, spending less time
   travelling to school, and achieving the best academic performance. Those
   who also collaborate in household activities, participate in
   sports/physical activity, do not smoke, do not drink, do not do drugs,
   do not consume stimulant drinks, have fit and healthy meals, spend less
   time per day on the computer, interactive games and TV, go out with
   friends moderately, usually have good quality sleep, sleep more, watch
   videos, study, read, and do not use the computer before going to sleep
   also achieve better school performance.
   Conclusion: School performance was associated with socio-demographic,
   school and academic contextual variables, as well as lifestyle and sleep
   habits. It is therefore concluded that young people's behaviour is
   crucial both to maintain a healthy life, as reflected in cognitive
   development, concentration skills, memory, reasoning, communication,
   interaction, attitudes and values with direct implications on school
   performance, and for overall adolescent well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anorexia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise
   specified{*} (not fulfilling Anorexia Nervosa DSM IV criteria) are
   increasing in Singapore. Patients with eating disorders may also present
   with other psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. The
   paper aims to investigate the association of co-morbid psychiatric
   disorders with the improvement of body mass index (BMI) in these
   patients.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of 182 patients with anorexia
   and eating disorder not otherwise specified at a tertiary hospital was
   done. The clinical course of co-morbid psychiatric disorders was
   correlated with the improvement of body mass index.
   Results: 109 patients were included in the analysis and the mean BMI on
   resolution of co-morbid psychiatric disorders was BMI 16.9. There is a
   significant association between the BMI groups and the resolution of
   co-morbid psychiatric disorders, chi(2) = 10.2, p = .03. Patients in BMI
   group 5 (BMI 16.6-18.5) were noted to be significantly less likely to
   resolve their psychiatric co-morbidity compared to the other 4 groups.

   Conclusion: Patients with anorexia nervosa and eating disorders not
   otherwise specified were at increased risk of having co-morbid
   psychiatric disorders and the clinical course of co-morbid psychiatric
   disorders appeared to correlate with improved BMI. Specifically patients
   with BMI < 16.5 with co-morbid psychiatric disorders were more likely to
   recover from their co-morbid psychiatric disorder with nutritional

Abstract = {{Throughout the Hunger Games trilogy, the residents of the Capitol are
   associated with an array of physical, behavioral, and sartorial traits
   that have stereotypically been associated with homosexuality in general
   and gay men in particular. Although none of these characters is
   explicitly identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or
   queer/questioning (LGBTQ), they are routinely linked with queer forms of
   feyness, fussiness, and flamboyance. How are young adult readers to
   interpret these details? What social message or political stance is
   Suzanne Collins conveying by making some of the vainest, powerful, and
   heartless characters in her book also in dialogue with common
   conceptions about queerness? Does The Hunger Games include these
   elements to dismantle negative stereotypes about LGBTQ people, or does
   the book perpetuate and even affirm homophobic attitudes? In what ways
   do these details impact the presentation of Katniss, in many ways, as a
   genderqueer figure herself? In exploring these and other questions, I
   draw on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's notion of ``paranoid reading.{''} While
   Sedgwick's concept of paranoid reading is intended to address LGBTQ
   content exclusively, I make a case that it is also a productive lens for
   examining the Hunger Games trilogy as a whole. Using the portrayal of
   the Capitol residents as an entry point for the trilogy's engagement
   with nonheteronormative gender and sexuality, I examine how the series
   serves both to reinforce and to resist homophobia. In so doing, I
   demonstrate the risks as well as the rewards of finding what we fear
   seeing in any work of dystopian young adult (YA) fiction.}},

   Of course we have to mention that diet and to some extent dependent on
   the locations of rebel department or location of the hiding places

   COOKING UPA engaged individuals who have the appropriate skills and in

   Figuring features material living conditions, moral and psychological

   descriptions of memories and diaries. That is often the nationalists had
   to starve days and weeks. Another drawback was the lack of domestic
   opportunities to kindle a fire in the open, because it could see the
   enemy. It was felt particularly sharply in early spring, when insurgents
   hiding places and left feeling cold.
   It should be noted that life in kryyivtsi had strict regulations: Time
   for morning hygiene, snidainverted left perpendicularnok, classes
   (history of Ukraine, ideological propaganda classes, items of general
   cycle general education), if the radio listening to just the latest

   underground. In particular, we highlight the religious and nationalist
   public holidays. Celebrating each holiday carefully prepared, develop
   manuals and guidelines. It was during the celebration of religious
   holidays and underground rebels had the opportunity to taste festive
   food. However, a complete meal (for all ritual canons) could have been

Abstract = {{Animals must balance the conflicting needs to forage and avoid
   predation. The optimal balance of risk and reward should depend on the
   individual's state, particularly hunger status. Satiated individuals are
   hypothesized to react more strongly to risk than hungry individuals, for
   which the necessity for food overrides perceived danger. We tested this
   in wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles by comparing the response
   of fasted and fed tadpoles to injured conspecifics (alarm cue) and
   uninjured conspecifics (control). Food restriction significantly
   affected the activity levels of tadpoles and the impact of injured
   conspecific cues on activity. Fed tadpoles responded little to these
   cues, tending to decrease activity. Hungry tadpoles were more active
   overall and responded to injured conspecific cues by increasing
   activity. We propose that hungry tadpoles increase their activity in
   response to an injured conspecific because, in addition to indicating
   danger, this cue represents a nutrient source for this opportunistically
   cannibalistic species, and hungry tadpoles should thus adopt risky
   behavior to acquire this valuable resource. Differences in hunger may
   therefore explain variation among studies of tadpole responses to
   injured conspecifics. Future studies in aquatic organisms should
   consider the role of hunger status when assessing antipredator behavior.}},

   or placebo daily for a period of 6 months. Participants will be tested
   at baseline and 6 months post-randomization on workplace stress,
   cognitive, personality and mood measures, cardiovascular (brachial and
   aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as arterial
   stiffness), biochemical (assays to measure inflammation and safety) as
   well as genetic assessments (to assess stress processing) and
   neuroimaging measures (to investigate in vivo mechanisms of action of B
   vitamins). In addition to this pre- and post-supplementation testing,
   participants will also complete a battery of self-report questionnaires
   online to assess their stress and mood once a month for the duration of
   the study. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effects of
   B vitamin supplementation on work related stress. The secondary aims are
   to explore the mechanisms underpinning any changes in mood or workplace
   stress due to the B vitamin intervention by examining relationships
   between cognitive, biological, neuroimaging and cardiovascular variables
   over 6 months. A subset of 40 participants (N = 20/group) will undergo
   neuroimaging at baseline and at 6 months using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in
   order to further explore in vivo mechanisms of action of B vitamins.}},

Abstract = {{The study objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a telephone
   delivered intervention consisting of motivational interviewing and
   cognitive behavioural strategies aimed at improving diet and physical
   activity in people diagnosed with psychotic disorders. Twenty
   participants diagnosed with a non-acute psychotic disorder were
   recruited. The intervention consisted of eight telephone delivered
   sessions targeting fruit and vegetable (F\&V) consumption and leisure
   screen time, as well as smoking and alcohol use (as appropriate). F\&V
   frequency and variety, and overall diet quality (measured by the
   Australian Recommended Food Score, ARFS), leisure screen time, overall
   sitting and walking time, smoking, alcohol consumption, mood, quality of
   life, and global functioning were examined before and 4-weeks
   post-treatment. Nineteen participants (95\%) completed all intervention
   sessions, and 17 (85\%) completed follow-tip assessments. Significant
   increases from baseline to post-treatment were seen in ARFS fruit,
   vegetable and overall diet quality scores, quality of life and global
   functioning. Significant reductions in leisure screen time and overall
   sitting' time were also seen. Results indicated that a telephone
   delivered intervention targeting key cardiovascular disease risk
   behaviours appears to be feasible and relatively effective in the
   short-term for people diagnosed with psychosis. A randomized controlled

Abstract = {{Prematurity and neonatal growth restriction (GR) are risk factors for
   autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Leptin
   production is suppressed during periods of undernutrition, and we have
   shown that isolated neonatal leptin deficiency leads to adult
   hyperactivity while neonatal leptin supplementation normalizes the brain
   morphology of GR mice. We hypothesized that neonatal leptin would
   prevent the development of GR-associated behavioral abnormalities. From
   postnatal day 4-14, C57BL/6 mice were randomized to daily injections of
   saline or leptin (80 ng/g), and GR was identified by a wean-ling weight
   below the tenth percentile. The behavioral phenotypes of GR and control
   mice were assessed beginning at 4 months. Within the tripartite chamber,
   GR mice had significantly impaired social interaction. Baseline escape
   times from the Barnes maze were faster for GR mice (65+/-6 s vs 87+/-7 s
   for controls, p < 0.05), but GR mice exhibited regression in their
   escape times on days 2 and 3 (56\% regressed vs 22\% of control saline
   mice, p < 0.05). Compared to controls, GR mice entered the open arms of
   the elevated plus maze more often and stayed there longer (72+/-10 s vs
   36+/-5 s, p < 0.01). Neonatal leptin supplementation normalized the
   behavior of GR mice across all behavioral assays. In conclusion, GR
   alters the social interactions, learning and activity of mice, and
   supplementation with the neurotrophic hormone leptin mitigates these
   effects. We speculate neonatal leptin deficiency may contribute to the
   adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with postnatal growth
   restriction, and postnatal leptin therapy may be protective. (C) 2014

Title = {{Association of Dietary Factors with Presence and Severity of Tinnitus in

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The impact of dietary factors on tinnitus has received
   limited research attention, despite being a considerable concern among
   people with tinnitus and clinicians. The objective was to examine the
   link between dietary factors and presence and severity of tinnitus.
   Design: This study used the UK Biobank resource, a large cross-sectional
   study of adults aged 40-69. 171,722 eligible participants were asked
   questions specific to tinnitus (defined as noises such as ringing or
   buzzing in the head or ears). Dietary factors included portions of fruit
   and vegetables per day, weekly fish consumption (oily and non-oily),
   bread type, cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and avoidance of dairy,
   eggs, wheat and sugar. We controlled for lifestyle, noise exposure,
   hearing, personality and comorbidity factors.
   Results: Persistent tinnitus, defined as present at least a lot of the
   time, was elevated with increased: (i) fruit/vegetable intake (OR=1.01
   per portion/day), (ii) bread (wholemeal/wholegrain, OR=1.07; other
   bread, 1.20) and (iii) dairy avoidance (OR=1.27). Persistent tinnitus
   was reduced with: (i) fish consumption (non-oily, OR=0.91; oily, 0.95),
   (ii) egg avoidance (OR=0.87) and (iii) caffeinated coffee consumption
   (OR=0.99 per cup/day). Reports of ``bothersome'' tinnitus
   (moderate-severe handicap) increased with wholemeal/wholegrain bread
   intake (OR=0.86). Reports of less frequent transient tinnitus increased
   with dairy avoidance (OR=1.18) and decreased with caffeinated coffee
   (OR=0.98 per cup/day) and brown bread (OR=0.94).
   Conclusions: This is the first population study to report the
   association between dietary factors and tinnitus. Although individually
   dietary associations are mostly modest, particular changes in diet, such
   as switching between foodstuffs, may result in stronger associations.
   These findings offer insights into possible dietary associations with
   tinnitus, and this may be useful when discussing management options in
   combination with other lifestyle changes and therapies.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Because antipredator behaviours are costly, the threat-sensitive
   predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that individual animals should
   express predator-avoidance behaviour proportionally to the perceived
   threat posed by the predator. Here, we experimentally tested this
   hypothesis by providing wild passerine birds supplemental food (on a
   raised feeding platform) at either 1 or 4 m from the edge of forest
   cover (potential refuge), in either the presence or absence of a nearby
   simulated predation threat (a sharp-shinned hawk Accipiter striatus
   model). Compared with the control treatment, we observed proportionally
   fewer bird visits to the food patch, and the birds took longer to
   re-emerge from forest refuge and return to feed at the food patch, after
   the hawk presentation than before it. The observed threat-sensitive
   latency-to-return response was stronger when the food patch was further
   away from the nearest refuge. Overall, our results are consistent with
   the predictions of the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis in
   that wild passerine birds (primarily black-capped chickadees Poecile
   atricapillus) exhibited more intense antipredator behavioural responses
   with increasing level of apparent threat. The birds were thus sensitive
   to their local perceived threat of predation and traded-off safety from
   predation (by refuging) and foraging gains in open habitat in a graded,
   threat-sensitive manner.}},

Abstract = {{This study piloted a multiple aspect approach to assess differences or
   changes in equine behaviour, using physiological (heart rates - HR,
   salivary cortisol - SC) and behavioural measures in various routine
   (feed-time, riding, turning out) and test situations (novel situation
   tests NS: 2x reactivity and 2x handling, Cross-over design). In order to
   evaluate if this approach could identify different behavioural patterns,
   two distinct groups of riding school horses (selected by experienced
   equine professionals) were observed repeatedly over 6 weeks: 6
   excitable/nervous horses (EX: Age: mean = 14 +/- 3.4, 8-18 yrs, BW 677
   +/- 48 kg, Body Condition {[}BC] = 4.6 +/- 0.4) and 6 calm, quiet horses
   (CA: Age: mean = 16 +/- 2.5, 12-18 yrs, BW 645 +/- 35, BC 5.1 +/- 0.4).
   EX horses had consistently lower SC levels than CA horses (p < 0.01),
   when coming in from the paddock in the morning. Therefore, there was a
   significant increase of SC after feeding for EX horses (+43\%, p < 0.05)
   but not for Group CA (only 16\%). After feeding SC showed no difference
   between the two groups. Calm horses had significantly higher HRs (44 +/-
   1.2 bpm) while waiting for feed and post feeding (p < 0.01) than EX
   horses (38 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). Behavioural measures showed significantly
   higher agitation scores for EX horses during feeding, walking to (p <
   0.01) and release into paddock (p < 0.05). When ridden, EX horses showed
   a greater amount of threatening behaviour towards other horses (p <
   0.05) and CA horses showed a significantly greater reluctance to move
   forward (p < 0.05). All mean agitation scores were significantly higher
   for Group EX (EX 2.3, CA 1.8, s.e.m. 0.3; p < 0.01) and apart from feed
   time these showed good correlations with behaviour observations. In the
   NS reactivity test CA horses had a significantly higher HR variability
   than EX horses (CA: 64 +/- 10.5, EX: 41 +/- 3.5, p < 0.05). There was no
   correlation between HRs and SC but in the NS handling test there was a
   correlation between SC and refusals to cross a bridge (p < 0.01; r(s)
   {[}12] = 0.70) as well as SC and agitation score (p = 0.07; r(s) {[}12]
   = 0.54). Horses which displayed a greater level of investigation scored
   lower in agitation behaviours (p < 0.01, r(s) {[}12] = -0.68). The
   methodology applied, clearly and consistently highlighted differences
   between horse groups, although the physiological measures did not always
   follow assumptions. Within groups individual horses reacted differently
   in standardised test and routine situations, highlighting that multiple
   testing will increase the chances of observing subtle changes in
   behaviour or perceived stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Hunger is the best spice: Effects of starvation in the antennal
   responses of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{8-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Blood-sucking insects strongly rely on olfactory cues to find their
   vertebrate hosts. As in other insects with different lifestyles, it has
   been shown that endogenous and exogenous factors modulate olfactory
   responses. The triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus is an important vector
   of Chagas disease and a classical model for studies of physiology and
   behavior. In this species, the behavioral response to host-derived
   odorants is modulated by both the time of the day and the starvation.
   Here I investigated the peripheral neural mechanisms underlying these
   modulatory effects. For this, I measured the electroantennogram (EAG)
   responses of insects towards different concentrations (from 0.5\% to
   75\% vol/vol) of an attractive host-odorant, ammonia. I tested the
   responses of starved and fed animals during the middle of the day (when
   insects are inactive and aggregated in refuges) and at the beginning of
   the night (when insects become active and search for hosts). Regardless
   of the time of the day and the starvation status, EAG responses
   systematically increased with odorant concentration, thus accurately
   reflecting the response of olfactory receptor cells. Interestingly, the
   EAG responses of starved insects were larger than those of fed insects
   only during the night, with larger differences (6-7 times) observed at
   low-middle concentrations. This study is the first reporting modulation
   of sensory responses at the neural level in triatomines. This
   modulation, considering that triatomine hosts are mostly diurnal and are
   also potential predators, has an important adaptive value, ensuring that
   insects search for hosts only when they are hungry and at appropriate
   times. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic correlations (r(P)) have frequently been observed between
   physiological and behavioural traits, and the nature of these

   on physiology-behaviour interrelations, but the potential for permanent
   changes induced by exposure to stress during development remains
   unexplored. We exposed female zebra finches to dietary restriction
   during the nestling stage and tested how this affected rP among a
   variety of physiological traits (haematocrit, stress-induced
   corticosterone level and basal metabolic rate (BMR)) and behavioural
   traits (activity and feeding rates in novel and familiar environments).
   Developmental stress completely uncoupled the relationship between
   activity in a novel environment and two physiological traits:
   haematocrit and BMR. This suggests that nutritionally based
   developmental stress has provoked changes in the energy budget that
   alleviate the trade-off between maintenance (BMR) and locomotor

Title = {{Ecological pharmacodynamics: prey toxin evolution depends on the
   physiological characteristics of predators}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{53-67}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of toxic chemical defences to repel and deter predators is
   widespread across living organisms, yet there are surprisingly few
   formal models of toxin evolution. Published models tend to focus on a
   trade-off between individual benefits and costs of toxicity, and treat
   predators as simple agents of selection, reducing future attacks when
   they encounter toxic prey. In this paper we argue, however, that the
   physiological characteristics of predators may be crucial in determining
   the nature and outcomes of toxin evolution. To examine this idea we
   devised and explored a model in which prey defence evolves in the
   context of predator physiology. We represented this as dose-effect
   relationships in predators for nutrition and toxins along with variable
   rates of predator metabolism. Incorporating variables of predator
   physiology can change views of toxin evolution. A key point is that
   inclusion of predator physiological variables requires that the
   nutritional value of prey is explicitly represented in the model, and
   this directly affects predictions for toxin evolution. In our model
   costly toxins generally evolve to the point that they are `minimally
   unprofitable': just toxic enough to make prey typically unprofitable
   given their nutritional value to predators. As the nutritional value of
   prey increases, so the minimally unprofitable toxin level of prey tends
   to increase in step; hence another general prediction from this model is
   that toxin levels within prey should often correlate with the
   nutritional value of the prey. Predator physiology and cognition also
   contribute to variation in the social nature of defence. We argue that
   incorporating representations of predator physiology is important in the
   comprehension of toxin evolution and make suggestions for directions of
   future work. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   fed with Bt (Cryl Ab) maize-fed Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)
   larvae (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) was evaluated. The predator showed 43.7\%
   delay in the nymphal development time and 15\% biomass reduction in the
   fifth instar, probably due to low nutritional quality of prey exposed to
   Bt maize. Survival curves were similar in predators fed with S.

   search time was slightly influenced by the developmental delay of S.
   frugiperda fed with Bt maize. In a greenhouse assay P. nigrispinus was

   the Cryl Ab protein. Our laboratory results indicate that Bt maize may
   cause indirect effects on P. nigrispinus, and suggest that nutritional
   prey-quality factors other than the Bt protein determine the observed
   negative effects. However, the semi-field greenhouse assays demonstrate
   that indirect negative effects of Bt maize on the predator's performance

Abstract = {{Do politically irrelevant events influence important policy opinions?
   Previous research on social welfare attitudes has emphasized the role of
   political factors such as economic self-interest and ideology. Here, we
   demonstrate that attitudes to social welfare are also influenced by
   short-term fluctuations in hunger. Using theories in evolutionary
   psychology, we predict that hungry individuals will be greedier and take
   more resources from others while also attempting to induce others to
   share by signaling cooperative intentions and expressing support for
   sharing, including evolutionarily novel forms of sharing such as social
   welfare. We test these predictions using self-reported hunger data as
   well as comparisons of subjects who participated in relevant online
   studies before and after eating lunch. Across four studies collected in
   two different welfare regimesthe United Kingdom and Denmarkwe
   consistently find that hungry individuals act in a greedier manner but
   describe themselves as more cooperative and express greater support for
   social welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualistic symbioses are ubiquitous in nature and facilitate high
   biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems by enhancing the efficiency
   of energy and nutrient use within ecological communities. For example,
   small groups of fish that inhabit coral colonies in reef ecosystems
   potentially enhance coral growth through defense from coral predators,
   aeration of coral tissue and nutrient provisioning. This study examines
   whether the prevalence and consequences of fish-coral interactions vary
   among sites with different environmental conditions in a coral reef
   lagoon, using the humbug damselfish Dascyllus aruanus and its preferred
   coral host Pocillopora damicornis as a study system. Using a field
   experiment, we tested the site-specific effects of D. aruanus on coral
   growth, and show that the cost-benefit ratio for corals hosting fish
   varies with local environmental variation. Results of this study also
   demonstrate that fish prefer to inhabit coral colonies with particular
   branch-spacing characteristics, and that the local abundance of D.
   aruanus influences the proportion of coral colonies within a site that
   are occupied by fish rather than increasing the number of fish per
   colony. We also show that corals consistently benefit from hosting D.
   aruanus via defense from predation by corallivorous butterflyfish,
   regardless of local environmental conditions. These findings highlight
   the need to consider the potential for multiple scale- and
   state-dependent interaction effects when examining the ecology of

Abstract = {{Competing successfully for the best feeding sites is an important
   behavioral strategy but little is known about how feeding sites vary
   nutritionally within a fruit tree. To answer this question we tested how
   the nutritional value of a fruit is influenced by its ripeness and its
   height within the tree crown. A complementary objective was to assess
   the nutritional value of the midripe fruit, a food item rarely mentioned
   in the literature despite being exploited on a daily basis by many
   frugivores. We measured how the dry weight of pulp, water content, and
   concentration of macronutrients and condensed tannins varied within the
   tree crowns of 15 fruit species. Collections occurred early in the
   fruiting cycle, so as to assess the amount of food in the tree before
   its exploitation by primates. We found that (1) the upper crown produced
   fruit densities 4.2 times higher, and a fruit crop 4.8 times larger,
   than the lower crown of the same tree; (2) considering only midripe and
   ripe stages, upper-crown fruits contained 28.6\% more dry pulp, 21.1\%
   more water, and 13.5\% more sugars per dry matter than lower-crown
   fruits of the same tree; (3) midripe fruits contained 80\% of the
   concentrations of sugars of ripe fruits, making them a sweeter food item
   than one would expect from the intermediate color of their epidermis;
   (4) cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, and ash proportionally decreased
   in concentration while dry pulp and sugars increased during ripening;
   and (5) ripe fruits were usually rare in the tree (<0.5\% of all fruit
   available) compared to midripe fruits (3-8\%). Overall, upper-crown
   feeding sites produced a higher density and quality of food than
   lower-crown sites of the same tree. Our data therefore provide a clear

Abstract = {{Animals, including fish, display individually consistent behavioral
   differences that may affect an individual's vulnerability not only to
   predation, but also to fishing. Compared with complex natural
   environments, plain hatchery environments might induce development of
   behaviors that increase vulnerability to fishing, which would in turn
   have major implications for the management of stocks by supportive
   releases. We studied whether the vulnerability of hatchery-reared brown
   trout (Salmo trutta) to angling could be predicted by rearing method
   (standard versus enriched) or behavioral variation that was assessed
   using long-term observations of moving activity in groups. High moving
   activity in the beginning of the behavioral tests (i.e., exploration
   behavior) predicted increased vulnerability to angling independently of
   fish body size. Standard rearing promoted high exploration rate among
   fish, whereas enriched rearing promoted improvement in body condition in
   (semi-) natural conditions. However, the driving influence of hunger on
   vulnerability could not be ruled out, as the most explorative
   standard-reared fish appeared unable to maintain their body condition
   during the experiments. This study provides direct evidence that
   standard hatchery rearing method promotes behaviors that directly

Abstract = {{1. Behavioural responses to varying macronutrient availability are
   increasingly studied in highly invasive ant species to better understand
   their ecological success. However, such work is lacking in relation to
   native ant species confronted with biological invaders. 2. Here the link
   between diet and behaviour was examined in Prolasius advenus, a native
   ant from New Zealand facing intense competition for food with invasive
   insects, including social wasps. A long-term laboratory experiment was
   conducted to assess the impact of protein and carbohydrate restriction
   on several behavioural parameters. 3. Ants shifted their food-collecting
   activity towards the least available macronutrient in both
   protein-limited and carbohydrate-limited colonies. But when lacking
   carbohydrate, they also strongly increased their efforts to discover
   resources. After 10weeks, the proportion of the colony patrolling
   outside of the nest was eight times higher than at the initiation of the
   experiment. This high patrolling activity was then maintained for
   several weeks and resulted in a higher efficiency to explore a novel
   territory. Moreover, ants fed a carbohydrate-limited diet engaged in
   longer aggressive acts towards conspecifics. 4. These behavioural
   responses to carbohydrate scarcity may, in part, enhance the ability of
   P. advenus to resist a competing invader under natural conditions. While
   much of the previous research has linked diet and behavioural dominance
   in invasive ants, the present study shows that conducting similar

   shed light on the mechanisms behind biotic resistance and the ability of
   some native species to coexist with highly abundant invaders.}},

   early-life exposures influence the risk of childhood obesity and related
   diseases later in life, and has now focused attention on the health of
   both mother and child. During pregnancy and the early neonatal period,
   individuals respond to their environment by establishing anatomical,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable
   neurodevelopmental condition, which is typically characterized by a
   triad of symptoms: impaired social communication, social reciprocity and
   repetitive stereotypic behavior. While the behavioral phenotype of ASD
   is well described, the search for reliable `autism biomarkers'
   continues.
   CONTENT: Insulin growth factor (IGF) is essential for the myelination of
   developing fetal neurons; this is in addition to the well-known links
   between IGF, maternal inlammation, infection and autism supporting IGF
   as a potential marker. Combining IGF data with data regarding levels of
   the known markers, serotonin and anti-myelin basic protein, in order to
   calculate an autism index, could provide a new diagnostic method for
   at-risk neonates. Disruptions to multiple pathophysiological systems,
   including redox, folate, methylation, tryptophan metabolism, and
   mitochondrial metabolism, have been well documented in autistic
   patients. Maternal infection and inlammation have known links with
   autism. Autoimmunity has therefore been a well-studied area of autism
   research. The potential of using autoantibodies as novel biomarkers for
   autism, in addition to providing insights into the neurodevelopmental
   processes that lead to autism.
   SUMMARY: The six proposed causes of autism involve both metabolic and
   immunologic dysfunctions and include: increased oxidative stress;
   decreased methionine metabolism and trans-sulfuration: aberrant free and
   bound metal burden; gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances;
   immune/inlammation dysregulation; and autoimmune targeting. A newborn
   screening program for early-onset ASD should be capable of utilizing a
   combination of ASD-associated biomarkers representative of the six
   proposed causes of autism in order to identify newborns at risk. The
   biomarkers discussed in this article are useful to guide the selection,
   eficacy, and suficiency of biomedical interventions, which would likely
   include nutritional supplementation, dietary changes, and speciic
   medications for treating GI pathogens and reducing inlammation.}},

Abstract = {{An organism's behavioral decisions often depend upon the relative

   However, whether sensitivity to such opposing influences is modulated in
   a unidirectional or bidirectional manner is not clear. Starved flies
   exhibit increased sugar and decreased bitter sensitivity. It is widely
   believed that only sugar sensitivity changes, and that this masks bitter
   sensitivity. Here we use gene-and circuit-level manipulations to show
   that sweet and bitter sensitivity are independently and reciprocally
   regulated by starvation in Drosophila. We identify orthogonal
   neuromodulatory cascades that oppositely control peripheral taste
   sensitivity for each modality. Moreover, these pathways are recruited at
   increasing hunger levels, such that low-risk changes (higher sugar
   sensitivity) precede high-risk changes (lower sensitivity to potentially

Abstract = {{Organisms exhibit plasticity in response to their environment, but there

   through size advantages in growth and development. However, the
   relationship between maternal influence and variation in plasticity in

   due to maternal provisioning and examined the relationship between
   maternal condition, egg provisioning and magnitude of plastic response
   to perceived predation risk (by dragonfly larvae: Aeshna spp.) in
   northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens). Females in better body
   condition tended to lay more (clutch size) larger (egg diameter) eggs.
   Tadpoles responded to predation risk by increasing relative tail depth
   (morphology) and decreasing activity (behaviour). We found a positive
   relationship between morphological effect size and maternal condition,

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Several studies reported the negative impact of elevated
   neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on outcomes in many surgical and
   medical conditions. Previous studies used arbitrary NLR cut-off points
   according to the average of the populations under study. There is no
   data on the average NLR in the general population. The aim of this study
   is to explore the average values of NLR and according to race in adult
   non-institutional United States individuals by using national data.
   Methods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
   of aggregated cross-sectional data collected from 2007 to 2010 was
   analyzed; data extracted included markers of systemic inflammation
   (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and NLR), demographic variables and
   other comorbidities. Subjects who were prescribed steroids,
   chemotherapy, immunomodulators and antibiotics were excluded. Adjusted
   linear regression models were used to examine the association between
   demographic and clinical characteristics and neutrophil counts,
   lymphocyte counts, and NLR.
   Results: Overall 9427 subjects are included in this study. The average
   value of neutrophils is 4.3k cells/mL, of lymphocytes 2.1k cells/mL; the
   average NLR is 2.15. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants have
   significantly lower mean NLR values (1.76, 95\% CI 1.71-1.81 and 2.08,
   95\% CI 2.04-2.12 respectively) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites
   (2.24, 95\% CI 2.19-2.28-p<0.0001). Subjects who reported diabetes,
   cardiovascular disease, and smoking had significantly higher NLR than
   subjects who did not. Racial differences regarding the association of

   Conclusions: This study is providing preliminary data on racial
   disparities in a marker of inflammation, NLR, that has been associated
   with several chronic diseases outcome, suggesting that different cut-off
   points should be set according to race. It also suggests that racial
   differences exist in the inflammatory response to environmental and

Abstract = {{The effects of low-level lead exposure on neuropsychological status in
   the United States (US) general adult population have been reported, and
   the relationship between neuropsychiatric dysfunction and health risk
   behaviors including substance use and sexual risk taking is well
   established. However, the potential influence of lead exposure on
   risk-taking behavior has received little attention. Using the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010, we estimated
   multivariable logistic regression models to measure odds ratios (ORs)
   and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the cross-sectional associations
   between blood lead level and risk behaviors including binge drinking,
   drug use, and indicator of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk.
   STI indicators included past 12 month sexual risk behaviors (age mixing
   with partners who were at least five years younger or older and multiple
   partnerships), self-reported STI, and biologically-confirmed herpes
   simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection. Dose-response like relationships
   were observed between blood lead and substance use, age mixing with
   younger and older partners, self-reported STI, and HSV-2. In addition,
   participants with lead levels in highest quartile versus those with
   levels in the lowest quartile had over three times the odds of binge
   drinking and over twice the odds of injection drug or cocaine use in the
   past 12 months, while being in one of the top two quartiles was
   significantly associated with 30-70\% increased odds of multiple
   partnerships, sex with older partners, and self-reported and
   biologically confirmed STI. Results from this study suggested that lead
   exposure may contribute to substance use, sexual risk-taking, and STI.
   However, given limitations inherent in the cross-sectional nature of the
   study, additional studies that use longitudinal data and measure
   detailed temporal information are warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Seabirds foraging on pelagic fish develop behavioral strategies
   specifically adapted to locate inconspicuous prey that are aggregated in
   spatially dynamic patches. In the marine environment, they may use
   various mechanisms to detect cues of prey availability. The aggregation
   of predators at a patch of food is a particularly obvious cue to locate
   prey, a mechanism known as local enhancement. Pioneering studies
   described the formation of foraging groups at sea, showing that seabirds
   are attracted to feeding conspecifics. Improved foraging success due to
   local enhancement has been suggested from modeling studies, but no
   direct validation of these results exists. We deployed video cameras
   concomitantly with GPS loggers on Cape gannets to study the behavioral
   responses of equipped birds to the aggregation of predators at food
   patches. We showed that the reaction distances of equipped birds
   increased with the size of an aggregation, demonstrating that predator
   aggregations enhance food detectability for foragers. For small
   aggregations (< 50 gannets), reaction distances were mostly less than 10
   km, and they increased up to almost 40 km for larger aggregations
   (100-150 gannets). In addition, we showed that the number and frequency
   of dives increased with the number of conspecifics aggregated, up to a
   threshold. The predator aggregations on a patch of food could,
   therefore, not only inform about the presence of prey but also entail
   information about foraging conditions. From direct observations on the
   various components involved, our study provides justification of the use
   and advantages of local enhancement in foraging seabirds.To locate
   inconspicuous and ephemeral fish schools in the ocean, seabirds may use
   indirect cues such as feeding conspecifics. Based on video cameras and
   GPS loggers concomitantly attached to Cape gannets, we showed that
   predator aggregations on a patch of food enhanced prey detectability.
   Gannets reacted to join a group of 50 feeding conspecifics from similar
   to 10 km, whereas a group of 100-150 gannets triggered a reaction from
   up to 40 km.}},

Abstract = {{In captivity, personality types differ in behavioral flexibility:
   ``fast{''} (neophilic, exploratory, and aggressive) types quickly form
   routines, whereas ``slow{''} types continually adjust their behavior
   with environmental changes. If these differences extend to pertinent
   natural environmental changes, which indicate changing predation or
   starvation threat, then personality may reflect important variation in
   how animals manage risk. We examined whether personality traits
   classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue
   tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral
   flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with
   changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the
   population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days.
   Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a
   relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates
   of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility.
   Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality
   traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally
   flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings
   suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about
   their environments and hence cope with environmental change.A bird's
   response to the weather depends on their personality. Individual birds,
   like humans, respond differently to the same novel or threatening
   situations. In winter, when starvation risk is greatest, blue tits
   varied in foraging strategy. Shy but exploratory individuals adjusted
   their feeder use with air temperature, feeding most on cold days. Bold
   but less exploratory individuals fed at a fixed rate all winter. Thus,
   personality may predict how individuals cope with environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{In urban habitats, organisms face unique fitness challenges including
   disturbance from human activity and noise. One physiological mechanism
   that may be plastically or evolutionarily modified to ameliorate
   deleterious effects of anthropogenic disturbance is the adrenocortical
   stress response. Individuals in urban environments may display smaller
   stress responses, which may prevent pathologies associated with
   consistent elevation of stress hormones, and may also show differences
   in baseline corticosterone (CORT, the primary avian stress hormone), due
   to altered energetic demands or chronic stress. We examined whether
   stress physiology and condition metrics in male song sparrows Melospiza
   melodia vary as a function of discrete differences in anthropogenic
   disturbance level (activity centers and refuges) or with continuous
   variation in an urbanization score and noise environment. Males breeding
   in activity centers displayed lower maximal (acute) CORT levels than
   activity refuge males, and acute CORT also tended to negatively
   correlate with urbanization score. Baseline CORT did not differ between
   habitat types, and activity center males also showed no evidence of
   changes in body mass, hematocrit, or antioxidant capacity. Further,
   activity center males had higher quality feathers (indicative of higher
   condition at molt) than activity refuge males. We found no indication
   that the noise environment altered stress physiology or condition in
   song sparrows. Overall, results suggest that song sparrows are an urban
   adapter species, which are not detrimentally affected by unique
   selective pressures encountered in the urban environment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether integrating influence strategies
   (reciprocation, consistency, consensus, feeling liked, authority, and
   scarcity) throughout Chickasaw Nation Special Supplemental Nutrition
   Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics (1) changed
   participants' perception of the WIC experience and (2) affected
   breastfeeding initiation rates.
   Methods: Two-part, quasi-experimental design.
   Setting: Four WIC clinics.
   Participants: Parents and caregivers of children birth to 3 years.
   Intervention: Behavior change intervention based on Social Cognitive
   Theory using Caildini's Principles of Influence. Traditional-model
   groups (control) received services prior to the intervention;
   influence-model groups (experimental) received services after initiation
   of the intervention.
   Main Outcomes: The preliminary demonstration project surveyed 2 groups
   to measure changes in their perceptions of the WIC environment.
   Secondary data analysis measured changes in breastfeeding initiation in
   2 groups of postpartum women.
   Analyses: Frequency analysis, independent sample t tests, chi-square for
   independence, step-wise logistic regression.
   Results: The demonstration project resulted in 5 improved influence
   measures (P < .02), aligning with the influence principle of ``feeling
   liked.{''} The model had a small effect (phi = 0.10) in distinguishing
   breastfeeding initiation; women in the influence model were 1.5 times
   more likely (95\% CI, 1.19-1.86; P < .05) to initiate breastfeeding
   compared with women in the traditional model, controlling for parity,
   mother's age, and race.
   Conclusions and Implications: Consistent with Social Cognitive Theory,
   changing the WIC environment by integrating influence principles may
   positively affect women's infant feeding decisions and behaviors,
   specifically breastfeeding initiation rates.}},

Volume = {{176}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{677-689}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{For foraging herbivores, both food quality and predation risk vary
   across the landscape. Animals should avoid low-quality food patches in
   favour of high-quality ones, and seek safe patches while avoiding risky
   ones. Herbivores often face the foraging dilemma, however, of choosing
   between high-quality food in risky places or low-quality food in safe
   places. Here, we explore how and why the interaction between food
   quality and predation risk affects foraging decisions of mammalian
   herbivores, focusing on browsers confronting plant toxins in a landscape
   of fear. We draw together themes of plant-herbivore and predator-prey
   interactions, and the roles of animal ecophysiology, behaviour and
   personality. The response of herbivores to the dual costs of food and
   fear depends on the interplay of physiology and behaviour. We discuss
   detoxification physiology in dealing with plant toxins, and stress
   physiology associated with perceived predation risk. We argue that
   behaviour is the interface enabling herbivores to stay or quit food
   patches in response to their physiological tolerance to these risks. We
   hypothesise that generalist and specialist herbivores perceive the
   relative costs of plant defence and predation risk differently and
   intra-specifically, individuals with different personalities and
   physiologies should do so too, creating individualised landscapes of
   food and fear. We explore the ecological significance and emergent
   impacts of these individual-based foraging outcomes on populations and
   communities, and offer predictions that can be clearly tested. In doing
   so, we provide an integrated platform advancing herbivore foraging
   theory with food quality and predation risk at its core.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer-driven nutrient recycling, the release of chemicals as
   byproducts and excesses of consumer physiology, can alter ecosystems by
   changing the availability of limiting nutrients at the base of the food
   web. The mere presence of predators can alter consumer physiology by
   restricting food intake and inducing stress. Predation risk, then, can
   influence ecosystem function by modifying the role of prey as nutrient
   recyclers, yet there are few empirical tests of how predation risk
   alters nutrient recycling by prey. Here, we present the results of a
   test for the effects of predation risk on the C and N budgets of
   Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We reared female guppies for
   7 weeks on diets of varying quality, and we compared control individuals
   to those exposed continuously to chemical cues emitted by a guppy
   predator, Crenicichla alta. We measured food consumption, growth rate,
   tissue elemental stoichiometry and N excretion by guppies on all
   treatments. Guppies strongly reduced food intake in the presence of
   predator cues; however, cue-exposed guppies assimilated nutrients more
   efficiently than controls. Specifically, cue-exposed guppies strongly
   increased N retention efficiency while only moderately increasing C
   efficiency. Consequently, guppies reared with predator cues excreted 39
   \% less N than control guppies. We suggest that reduced foraging,
   enhanced nutrient efficiency, and decreased N excretion are adaptive
   responses to the extrinsic mortality threat posed by guppy predators.
   The resulting substantial reduction in N excretion by guppies may
   influence ecosystem function in natural streams by reducing the supply
   of a limiting nutrient.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the influence of rearing system (free-ranging (FR)
   v. confinement (C)) on buffalo heifer efficiency to reach age of puberty
   and on behavioural and immune functions, two experiments were conducted
   from September 2010 to October 2011. In Experiment I, 32 subjects aged 8
   to 9 months at the start of experiment were used. A total of 16 animals
   (group C) were group housed in an indoor slatted floor pen (4
   m(2)/animal) with an outdoor paddock (4 m(2)/animal); 16 others grazed
   on a Mediterranean natural pasture of 40 ha (group FR). Behavioural data
   were collected and organic matter digestibility, blood metabolites and
   progesterone were determined. At the end of the experiment, a novel
   object test and a skin test were conducted, and the avoidance distance
   (AD) at the manger was measured. Free-ranging animals were able to
   express natural behaviours such as wallowing and grazing. C animals
   devoted more time to the novel object than FR animals, whereas AD at
   manger was lower in group FR than in group C (P < 0.01). Cellular immune
   response was higher in FR heifers than in C animals (P < 0.01). FR
   animals also showed a higher digestibility of organic matter (P < 0.01).
   Heifers from group FR had higher plasma concentrations of non-esterified
   fatty acids (P < 0.001) and lower concentrations of glucose than heifers
   from group C (P < 0.001). C animals showed higher daily weight gains (P
   < 0.01) and weight at the puberty (P < 0.05), but there were no
   differences in terms of age of puberty between the two groups. The
   intakes of dry matter (DM), CP and energy to reach the age of puberty
   were similar in both groups. In order to verify whether the results
   obtained in Experiment I could be replicated in different rearing
   conditions (reduced pasture availability, different location and
   altitude), a second experiment was conducted on 26 animals, where only
   onset of age of puberty and metabolic profile were monitored. In
   Experiment II, 13 heifers grazed on a natural pasture of 5 ha, other 13
   received the same space as indicated for Experiment I. Results from
   Experiment II generally confirmed those of Experiment I. Only the
   intakes of DM and energy to reach the age of puberty were higher in
   group C than in FR (P < 0.001). A lower competition with human
   nutrition, reproductive performances similar to those shown by confined
   animals and the indications given by immune and behavioural variables,
   suggest that a free-range-based system may be conveniently used for
   buffalo heifer farming purposes.}},

   1) and infants with prenatal growth restraint indicated by rapid
   postnatal catch-up growth (group 2), compared with infants with normal
   postnatal growth (group 3). Seventy-five CpG loci were differentially

Abstract = {{Objective: Eating behavior traits measured in early life predict eating
   behavior and weight trajectories later in development, and may be
   associated with certain parental feeding behaviors. Our goal was to
   investigate the relationship between a range of feeding behaviors, and
   preschoolers' appetitive traits.
   Method: Four hundred thirty-nine parents of UK 3-5 year olds completed
   scales measuring authoritarian vs. authoritative forms of limiting
   (Restriction vs. Monitoring) and promoting (Pressuring vs. Prompting)
   intake, as well as Emotional and Instrumental Feeding. Parents also
   completed scales measuring child Food responsiveness and Satiety
   responsiveness. Child BMI z-scores were calculated based on measured
   heights and weights.
   Results: Parental Restriction was significantly associated with greater
   child Food responsiveness (p <. 001), but parental Monitoring was not.
   Parental Pressuring was significantly associated with greater child
   Satiety responsiveness (p <. 001), while parental Prompting was not.
   Parental Instrumental and Emotional feeding were both associated with
   greater child Food responsiveness (p <. 001). All relationships were
   independent of child BMI z-score.
   Discussion: Prospective data are needed to determine whether the
   parent-child feeding relationships identified here promote, or protect
   against, the development of eating pathology in children. However, our
   results suggest that cross-sectional associations depend on the style
   (e. g., authoritarian vs. authoritative), as well as the type of feeding
   behavior measured. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Animals must overcome the physical properties protecting foods to obtain
   nutrition. While animals can experience selection for traits that
   facilitate resource exploitation, specific feeding behaviors may entail
   multiple, different mechanical challenges with each potentially
   eliciting distinct selection pressures. Tree gouging by common marmosets
   (Primates: Callithrix jacchus) provides an illustrative case for
   studying these distinct mechanical challenges and their correlated
   behaviors and morphologies. We test the hypothesis that marmosets
   respond differently to three sequential mechanical stages of bark
   removal: (1) indentation; (2) crack initiation; (3) crack propagation.
   By surveying trees gouged by free-ranging marmosets in Pernambuco,
   Brazil, we found that mechanical variables related to crack initiation
   (fracture toughness, critical strain energy release rate and elastic
   modulus) were inversely correlated with measures of gouging intensity,
   with less mechanically challenging trees being gouged more intensely.
   Because crack initiation is likely the most mechanically challenging
   aspect of tree gouging, behavioral preference for less challenging
   resources likely allows marmosets to reduce costs and potential risks
   associated with accessing exudates. Variables related to bark
   indentation (hardness and friction) showed no relationship to the
   intensity of gouging behavior. Contrary to our prediction, trees with
   greater mechanical challenges for crack propagation (work to peel) were
   gouged more intensely. We attribute this pattern of gouging trees
   requiring greater effort in crack propagation to an inverse correlation
   between work to peel and fracture toughness in our tree sample.
   Importantly, marmosets exhibit morphological specializations of the
   feeding apparatus that facilitate indentation and crack propagation,
   potentially mitigating the need for behavioral choice. Here we show that
   extracting a single food resource can exert a series of distinct,
   potentially competing, selective forces during resource acquisition.
   This study illustrates how animals combine behaviors and morphological
   specializations to competently overcome distinct mechanical challenges,
   emphasizing the need for holistic approaches in understanding feeding
   adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has been used as a genetic

   is derived from stroke-resistant SHR as SHR/NIH and SHR/NCrl but from
   22nd to 23rd generation descendants of the SHR/NIH ancestor and
   therefore may show different behavioral phenotypes compared to other SHR
   sub-strains. In this study, ADHD-like behaviors in SHR/Izm were
   evaluated compared to Wistar rats. SHR/Izm showed high locomotor
   activity in the habituation phase in a novel environment, although
   locomotor activity in the initial exploratory phase was low. In a
   behavioral test for attention, spontaneous alternation behavior in the
   Y-maze test was impaired in SHR/Izm. However, impulsive behavior in the
   elevated-plus maze test, which is designed to detect anxiety-related
   behavior but also reflects impulsivity for novelty seeking, was
   comparable to Wistar rats. Hyperactivity and inattention, detected as
   ADHD-like behaviors in SHR/Izm, were ameliorated with methylphenidate at
   a low dose (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.). Therefore, SHR/Izm represents a unique

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of potent mycotoxins that
   frequently pollute agro-products and animal feeds. For complex reasons,
   the regulatory limits of AFs differ from nation to nation. In this
   study, feedstuffs contaminated with various concentrations of aflatoxin
   B1 (AFB1) corresponding to AF regulatory limits of major agro-product
   importing and exporting nations were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats, and
   the toxicological results were evaluated.
   RESULTS: During the trial period, no poisoning behavior was observed and
   no animals died. No significant differences in body weight were observed
   between AFB1-contaminated and control rats. However, various negative
   impacts on liver and kidney functions were observed in AFB1-contaminated
   groups, and these negative impacts were positively correlated with AFB1
   concentrations. At concentrations of 4-50 mu g kg(-1), AFB1 tolerance
   was observed for the liver after 15 days of testing, but this tolerance
   was not observed for the kidney.
   CONCLUSION: Low concentrations of AFB1 still induced obvious
   toxicological impacts on Sprague-Dawley rats, and the negative effects
   were aggravated by increasing the AFB1 dose and feeding time. Therefore
   strict AF regulatory limits are suggested for food safety
   administration, especially for the low-income nations with higher

Title = {{Reproductive responses of birds to experimental food supplementation: a
   meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Food availability is an important environmental cue for
   animals for deciding how much to invest in reproduction, and it
   ultimately affects population size. The importance of food limitation
   has been extensively studied in terrestrial vertebrate populations,
   especially in birds, by experimentally manipulating food supply.
   However, the factors explaining variation in reproductive decisions in
   response to food supplementation remain unclear. By performing
   meta-analyses, we aim to quantify the extent to which supplementary
   feeding affects several reproductive parameters in birds, and identify
   the key factors (life-history traits, behavioural factors, environmental
   factors, and experimental design) that can induce variation in laying
   date, clutch size and breeding success (i.e., number of fledglings
   produced) in response to food supplementation.
   Results: Food supplementation produced variable but mostly positive
   effects across reproductive parameters in a total of 201 experiments
   from 82 independent studies. The outcomes of the food effect were
   modulated by environmental factors, e. g., laying dates advanced more
   towards low latitudes, and food supplementation appeared not to produce
   any obvious effect on bird reproduction when the background level of
   food abundance in the environment was high. Moreover, the increase in
   clutch size following food addition was more pronounced in birds that
   cache food, as compared to birds that do not. Supplementation timing was
   identified as a major cause of variation in breeding success responses.
   We also document the absence of a detectable food effect on clutch size
   and breeding success when the target species had poor access to the feed
   due to competitive interactions with other animals.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, from the pool of bird species
   and environments reviewed, extra food is allocated to immediate
   reproduction in most cases. Our results also support the view that bird
   species have evolved different life-history strategies to cope with
   environmental variability in food supply. However, we encourage more
   research at low latitudes to gain knowledge on how resource allocation
   in birds changes along a latitudinal gradient. Our results also
   emphasize the importance of developing experimental designs that
   minimise competition for the supplemented food and the risk of
   reproductive bottle-necks due to inappropriate supplementation timings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Interventions are needed to reduce poor perinatal health. We
   trained community health workers (CHWs) as home visitors to address
   maternal/infant risks.
   Methods: In a cluster randomised controlled trial in Cape Town
   townships, neighbourhoods were randomised within matched pairs to 1) the
   control, healthcare at clinics (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 594 women),
   or 2) a home visiting intervention by CBW trained in
   cognitive-behavioural strategies to address health risks (by the Philani
   Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Programme), in addition to clinic
   care (n = 12 neighbourhoods; n = 644 women). Participants were assessed
   during pregnancy (2\% refusal) and 92\% were reassessed at two weeks
   post-birth, 88\% at six months and 84\% at 18 months later. We analysed
   32 measures of maternal/infant well-being over the 18 month follow-up
   period using longitudinal random effects regressions. A binomial test
   for correlated outcomes evaluated overall effectiveness over time. The
   18 month post-birth assessment outcomes also were examined alone and as
   a function of the number of home visits received.
   Results: Benefits were found on 7 of 32 measures of outcomes, resulting
   in significant overall benefits for the intervention compared to the
   control when using the binomial test (p = 0.008); nevertheless, no
   effects were observed when only the 18 month outcomes were analyzed.
   Benefits on individual outcomes were related to the number of home
   visits received. Among women living with HIV, intervention mothers were
   more likely to implement the PMTCT regimens, use condoms during all
   sexual episodes (OR = 1.25; p = 0.014), have infants with healthy
   weight-for-age measurements (OR = 1.42; p = 0.045), height-for-age
   measurements (OR = 1.13, p<0.001), breastfeed exclusively for six months
   (OR = 3.59; p<0.001), and breastfeed longer (OR = 3.08; p<0.001). Number
   of visits was positively associated with infant birth weight >= 2500
   grams (OR = 1.07; p = 0.012), healthy head-circumference-for-age
   measurements at 6 months (OR = 1.09, p = 0.017), and improved cognitive
   development at 18 months (OR = 1.02, p = 0.048).
   Conclusions: Home visits to neighbourhood mothers by CHWs may be a
   feasible strategy for enhancing maternal/child outcomes. However, visits
   likely must extend over several years for persistent benefits.}},

Title = {{Why does society accept a higher risk for alcohol than for other
   voluntary or involuntary risks?}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Societies tend to accept much higher risks for voluntary
   behaviours, those based on individual decisions (for example, to smoke,
   to consume alcohol, or to ski), than for involuntary exposure such as
   exposure to risks in soil, drinking water or air. In high-income
   societies, an acceptable risk to those voluntarily engaging in a risky
   behaviour seems to be about one death in 1,000 on a lifetime basis.
   However, drinking more than 20 g pure alcohol per day over an adult
   lifetime exceeds a threshold of one in 100 deaths, based on a
   calculation from World Health Organization data of the odds in six
   European countries of dying from alcohol-attributable causes at
   different levels of drinking.
   Discussion: The voluntary mortality risk of alcohol consumption exceeds
   the risks of other lifestyle risk factors. In addition, evidence shows
   that the involuntary risks resulting from customary alcohol consumption
   far exceed the acceptable threshold for other involuntary risks (such as
   those established by the World Health Organization or national
   environmental agencies), and would be judged as not acceptable.
   Alcohol's exceptional status reflects vagaries of history, which have so
   far resulted in alcohol being exempted from key food legislation (no
   labelling of ingredients and nutritional information) and from
   international conventions governing all other psychoactive substances
   (both legal and illegal). This is along with special treatment of
   alcohol in the public health field, in part reflecting overestimation of
   its beneficial effect on ischaemic disease when consumed in moderation.
   Summary: A much higher mortality risk from alcohol than from other risk
   factors is currently accepted by high income countries.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective pressure generating morphological,
   physiological and behavioural responses in organisms. As predation risk
   is often higher during juvenile stages, antipredator defences expressed
   early in life are paramount to survival. Maternal effects are an
   efficient pathway to produce such defences. We investigated whether
   maternal exposure to predator cues during gestation affected juvenile
   morphology, behaviour and dispersal in common lizards (Zootoca
   vivipara). We exposed 21 gravid females to saurophagous snake cues for
   one month while 21 females remained unexposed (i.e. control). We
   measured body size, preferred temperature and activity level for each
   neonate, and released them into semi-natural enclosures connected to
   corridors in order to measure dispersal. Offspring from exposed mothers
   grew longer tails, selected lower temperatures and dispersed thrice more
   than offspring from unexposed mothers. Because both tail autotomy and
   altered thermoregulatory behaviour are common antipredator tactics in
   lizards, these results suggest that mothers adjusted offspring phenotype
   to risky natal environments (tail length) or increased risk avoidance
   (dispersal). Although maternal effects can be passive consequences of
   maternal stress, our results strongly militate for them to be an
   adaptive antipredator response that may increase offspring survival
   prospects.}},

Abstract = {{Research into the impact of atmospheric change on predator-prey

   predator-prey interactions has received little attention in
   environmental change research. Group living animals have evolved
   behavioral mechanisms to escape predation, including chemical alarm
   signalling. Chemical alarm signalling between conspecific prey could be
   susceptible to environmental change if the physiology and behavior of
   these organisms are affected by changes in dietary quality resulting
   from environmental change. Using Rubus idaeus plants, we show that
   elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) severely impaired
   escape responses of the aphid Amphorophora idaei to predation by
   ladybird larvae (Harmonia axyridis). Escape responses to ladybirds was
   reduced by > 50 \% after aphids had been reared on plants grown under
   eCO(2). This behavioral response was rapidly induced, occurring within
   24 h of being transferred to plants grown at eCO(2) and, once induced,
   persisted even after aphids were transferred to plants grown at ambient
   CO2. Escape responses were impaired due to reduced sensitivity to aphid
   alarm pheromone, (E)-beta-farnesene, via an undefined plant-mediated
   mechanism. Aphid abundance often increases under eCO(2), however,
   reduced efficacy of conspecific signalling may increase aphid
   vulnerability to predation, highlighting the need to study the chemical
   ecology of predator-prey interactions under environmental change.}},

Title = {{Predictors for early introduction of solid food among Danish mothers and
   infants: an observational study}},
Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early introduction of complementary feeding may interfere
   with breastfeeding and the infant's self-controlled appetite resulting
   in increased growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   predictors for early introduction of solid food.
   Methods: In an observational study Danish mothers filled in a
   self-administered questionnaire approximately six months after birth.
   The questionnaire included questions about factors related to the
   infant, the mother, attachment and feeding known to influence time for
   introduction of solid food. The study population consisted of 4503
   infants. Data were analysed using ordered logistic regression models.
   Outcome variable was time for introduction to solid food.
   Results: Almost all of the included infants 4386 (97\%) initiated
   breastfeeding. At weeks 16, 17-25, 25+, 330 infants (7\%); 2923 (65\%);
   and 1250 (28\%), respectively had been introduced to solid food. Full
   breastfeeding at five weeks was the most influential predictor for later
   introduction of solid food (OR = 2.52 CI: 1.93-3.28). Among infant
   factors male gender, increased gestational age at birth, and higher
   birth weight were found to be statistically significant predictors.
   Among maternal factors, lower maternal age, higher BMI, and being
   primipara were significant predictors, and among attachment factors
   mother's reported perception of the infant as being temperamental, and
   not recognising early infant cues of hunger were significant predictors
   for earlier introduction of solid food. Supplementary analyses of
   interactions between the predictors showed that the association of
   maternal perceived infant temperament on early introduction was
   restricted to primiparae, that the mother's pre-pregnancy BMI had no
   impact if the infant was fully breastfed at week five, and that birth
   weight was only associated if the mother had reported early uncertainty
   in recognising infant's cues of hunger.
   Conclusions: Breastfeeding was the single most powerful indicator for
   preventing early introduction to solid food. Modifiable predictors
   pointed to the importance of supporting breastfeeding and educating
   primipara and mothers with low birth weight infants to be able to read
   and respond to their infants' cues to prevent early introduction to
   solid food.}},

Abstract = {{Annual grain crops dominate agricultural landscapes and provide the
   majority of calories consumed by humanity. Perennial grain crops could
   potentially ameliorate the land degradation and off-site impacts
   associated with annual grain cropping. However, herbaceous perennial
   plants with constitutively high allocation to harvestable seeds are rare
   to absent in nature. Recent trade-off theory models suggest that rugged
   fitness landscapes may explain the absence of this form better than sink
   competition models. Artificial selection for both grain production and
   multiyear lifespan can lead to more rapid progress in the face of
   fitness and genetic trade-offs than natural selection but is likely to
   result in plant types that differ substantially from all current
   domestic crops. Perennial grain domestication is also likely to require
   the development of selection strategies that differ from published crop
   breeding methods, despite their success in improving long-domesticated
   crops; for this purpose, we have reviewed literature in the areas of
   population and evolutionary genetics, domestication, and molecular
   biology. Rapid domestication will likely require genes with large effect
   that are expected to exhibit strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Cryptic
   genetic variation will need to be deliberately exposed both to purge
   mildly deleterious alleles and to generate novel agronomic phenotypes.
   We predict that perennial grain domestication programs will benefit from
   population subdivision followed by selection for simple traits in each
   subpopulation, the evaluation of very large populations, high selection
   intensity, rapid cycling through generations, and heterosis. The latter
   may be particularly beneficial in the development of varieties with
   stable yield and tolerance to crowding.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine if the feeding behavior of
   dairy cows is modified through live yeast supplementation. Twelve
   lactating. Holstein dairy cows (2 primiparous and 10 multiparous) were
   individually exposed, in a replicated crossover design, to each of 2
   treatment diets (over 35-d periods): (1) a control TMR and (2) a control
   TMR plus 1 x 10(10) cfu/head per day of live yeast (Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae CNCM I-1077; Levucell SC20; Lallemand Animal Nutrition,
   Montreal, QC, Canada). Milk production, feeding, and rumination behavior
   were electronically monitored for each animal for the last 7 d of each
   treatment period. Milk samples were collected for the last 6 d of each
   period for milk component, analysis. Dry matter intake (28.3 kg/d),
   eating time (229.3 min/d), and rate (0.14 kg of dry matter/min) were
   similar between treatments. With yeast supplementation, meal criteria
   (minimum intermeal interval) were shorter (20.0 vs. 25.8 min),
   translating to cows tending to have more meals (9.0 vs. 7.8 meals/d),
   which tended to be smaller in size (3.4 vs. 3.8 kg/meal).
   Yeast-supplemented cows also tended to ruminate longer (570.3 vs. 544.9
   min/d). Milk yield (45.8 kg/d) and efficiency of production (1.64 kg of
   milk/kg of dry matter intake) were similar between treatments. A
   tendency for higher milk fat percent (3.71 vs. 3.55\%) and yield (1.70
   vs. 1.63 kg/d) was observed when cows were supplemented with yeast. No
   differences in milk fatty acid composition were observed, with the
   exception of a tendency for a greater concentration of 18:2 cis-9,cis-12
   fatty acid (2.71 vs. 2.48\% of total fatty acids) with yeast
   supplementation. Yeast-supplemented cows had lower mean ruminal
   temperature (38.4 vs. 38.5 degrees C) and spent less time with rumen
   temperature above 39.0 degrees C (353.1 vs. 366.9 min/d), potentially
   indicating improved rumen pH conditions. Overall, the results show that
   live yeast supplementation tended to improve meal patterns and
   rumination, rumen temperature, and milk fat production.}},

Abstract = {{Salamanders are among the few vertebrates that have successfully
   colonized and exploited subterranean habitats, demonstrating flexibility
   in behavior and physiology. However, our knowledge of the ecology and
   life history of many subterranean salamanders is poor because of the
   limits and challenges of studying organisms in subterranean habitats.
   The Grotto Salamander (Eurycea spelaea) is an obligate subterranean
   plethodontid salamander, endemic to the Ozark Plateau Ecoregion of North
   America, and a top predator in many caves. We conducted a 25-mo
   mark-release-recapture study of E. spelaea within a 440-m section of a
   cave in Delaware County, Oklahoma to better understand the life history
   and demography of the species. We also examined this salamander's
   association with another cave-dependent species, the federally
   endangered Gray Bat (Myotis grisescens). We found that Grotto
   Salamanders spend typically 2-5 years as larvae, although some
   individuals delay metamorphosis several additional years, and that
   adults could live at least 9 years. We estimated population size to be
   305 +/- 126 individuals between December 2001 and February 2002, but
   decreased during subsequent surveys to a low of 101 +/- 48 individuals.
   Body condition varied seasonally; in general, body condition was greater
   from May to November, when bats were roosting and depositing fresh
   guano, and lower from December to April when bats were absent.
   Presumably, fresh guano produced pulses in nutrient availability and
   invertebrate densities, the latter of which are important food sources
   for E. spelaea. Declines in bat populations could have detrimental
   effects throughout subterranean food webs, including negative impacts on
   E. spelaea populations.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in a wide variety of
   organisms. Although several genes and pathways associated with this
   longevity response have been identified, the specific mechanism through
   which DR extends lifespan is not fully understood. We have recently
   developed a novel methodology to screen for transcriptional changes in
   response to acutely imposed DR upon adult Drosophila melanogaster and
   identified groups of genes that switch their transcriptional patterns
   from a normal diet pattern to a restricted diet pattern, or `switching
   genes'. In this current report we extend our transcriptional data
   analysis with gene set enrichment analysis to generate a
   pathway-centered perspective. The pattern of temporal behavior in
   response to the diet switch is strikingly similar within and across
   pathways associated with mRNA processing and protein translation.
   Furthermore, most genes within these pathways display an initial spike
   in activity within 6-8 h from the diet switch, followed by a
   coordinated, partial down-regulation after 24 h. We propose this
   represents a stereotypical response to DR, which ultimately leads to a
   mild but widespread inhibition of transcriptional and translational
   activity. Inhibition of the protein synthesis pathway has been observed
   in DR in other studies and has been shown to extend lifespan in several
   model organisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive developmental plasticity allows individuals experiencing poor
   environmental conditions in early life to adjust their life-history
   strategy in order to prioritize short-term fitness benefits and maximize
   reproductive output in challenging environments. Much research has been
   conducted to test whether such adoption of a ``faster{''} life-history
   strategy is accompanied by concordant changes in behavior and
   physiology, with mixed results. As research in this field has focused on
   comparison of mean-level responses of treatment groups, few studies
   include repeated measures of response variables and the effect that
   developmental stress may have on repeatability per se. We investigated
   how early-developmental stress affects the mean expression of (and
   repeatability in) a variety of behavioral and physiological traits in
   female zebra finches. We predicted that: (1) individuals subjected to
   nutritional restriction in the nestling phase would have higher feeding
   and activity rates, with associated increases in hematocrit and basal
   metabolic rates (BMRs), (2) nutritional restriction in early life would
   alter adults' stress-induced corticosterone level, and (3) developmental
   stress would, respectively, influence the amount of among-individual and
   within-individual variation in behavioral and physiological traits,
   hence affecting the repeatability of these traits. In comparison to
   control females, stressed females did not differ in activity rate or
   stress-induced corticosterone level, but they did have higher levels of
   feeding, hematocrit, and BMR. Among-individual variance and
   repeatability were generally higher in stressed females than in
   controls. Finally, we found that developmental dietary restriction
   significantly reduced the amount of within-individual variance both in
   activity rate in the novel environment and in stress-induced
   corticosterone level. Our results not only confirm previous findings on
   the effect of early-developmental stress on BMR, but also extend its
   effect to feeding rate and hematocrit, suggesting that developmental
   plasticity in these traits is ontogenetically linked.
   Early-developmental stress may disable particular genetic canalizing
   processes, which would release cryptic genetic variation and explain why
   repeatability and among-individual variance were generally higher in the
   stressed groups than in controls. For activity rate in the novel
   environment and with stress-induced corticosterone level, however,
   early-developmental stress significantly reduced within-individual
   variance, which may be a consequence of increased canalization of these
   traits at the micro-environmental level.}},

Abstract = {{1. Modification of behaviours in the presence of predators or predation
   cues is widespread among animals. The costs of a behavioural change in
   the presence of predators or predation cues depend on fitness effects of
   lost feeding opportunities and, especially when organisms are sexually
   dimorphic in size or timing of maturation, these costs are expected to
   differ between the sexes. 2. Larval Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Diptera:
   Culicidae) were used to test the hypothesis that behavioural responses
   of the sexes to predation cues have been selected differently due to
   different energy demands. 3. Even in the absence of water-borne
   predation cues, hungry females (the larger sex) spent more time browsing
   than did males, indicating a difference in energy needs. 4. In the
   presence of predation cues, well-fed larvae of both sexes reduced their
   activity more than did hungry larvae, and males shifted away from
   high-risk behaviours to a greater degree than did females, providing the
   first evidence of sex-specific antipredator behaviour in foraging
   mosquito larvae. 5. Because sexual size dimorphism is common across
   taxa, and energetic demands are probably correlated with size
   dimorphism, this research demonstrates the importance of investigating
   sex-specific behaviour and behavioural responses to enemies, and

   consistent with other go/no-go tasks, it was given to 147 healthy,

   measured prior to dispersal were linked to the subsequent dispersal
   decision in 77 roe deer Capreolus capreolus fawns. Using an unusually
   detailed multi-trait approach, we identified two independent behavioural
   continuums related to dispersal. First, a continuum of energetic
   expenditure contrasted individuals of low mobility, low variability in
   head activity and low body temperature with those that displayed
   opposite traits. Second, a continuum of neophobia contrasted individuals
   that explored more prior to dispersal and were more tolerant of capture

Abstract = {{Animal welfare enhancement requires that problems are reliably
   identified and ranked in order to prioritise corrective actions. Welfare
   problems vary with the conditions in which animals are maintained. The
   objectives were to highlight major welfare problems for dairy cows on
   farms in France, and find out how farm characteristics (housing and
   milking systems, breed) could impact specific welfare aspects on these
   farms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 131 French dairy farms.
   We used the Welfare Quality (R) protocol, which addresses all aspects of
   welfare, and yields scores for principles and criteria that represent
   how well farms meet welfare requirements (from 0 for a very adverse
   situation to 100 for an excellent one). We used descriptive statistics
   to highlight low welfare scores, and variance analyses to compare farms.
   Most farms were found `Acceptable' according to the Welfare Quality (R)
   classification. Principles scores for Health, Feeding and Behaviour
   ranged from 33 to 39. The median score for eight of the welfare criteria
   was below 50 ('Pain', `Integument alterations', `Diseases', `Comfort
   around resting', `Social behaviours', `Human-animal relationship',
   `Positive emotional state', `Hunger'), while the median score was above
   50 for the four other criteria ('Thirst', `Lameness', `Expression of
   other behaviours', `Ease of movement'). The scores varied widely between
   farms, within and between systems. Farms with cubicles obtained lower
   scores for `Comfort around resting', `Injuries'; farms with Holstein

Abstract = {{Energy is typically a limiting factor for animals during boreal winters,
   when low temperatures increase the cost of thermoregulation at the same
   times as short day-lengths and snow cover constrain foraging
   opportunities. Under these circumstances animals use a suite of
   behavioural and physiological adaptations to avoid overnight starvation.
   However, it is poorly understood how such strategies are affected by
   increased energy demands from other physiological systems. Thus, we used
   free-ranging blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, to test if competing
   demands for energy (here induced by a non-inflammatory,
   antibody-mediated immune challenge) would affect nocturnal body
   temperature (a predictor of energy expenditure in small animals) and
   energy-saving nest box roosting behaviour. We also assessed if the
   immune challenge incurred long-term survival costs. We found no evidence
   that body temperature regulation differed between immune-challenged and
   saline-injected birds. Nor did the immune challenge reduce survival to
   the next breeding season. However, old (second winter or older)
   immune-challenged birds continued roosting in nest boxes to a larger
   extent at the peak immune response, despite increased perceived
   predation risk induced by the preceding capture and immunization. In
   contrast, old control birds were less prone to roost in nest boxes after
   capture and saline injection. This difference was less pronounced in
   young (first winter) birds. We interpret the increased risk-taking
   behaviour in immune-challenged birds as a consequence of a higher need
   for exploiting the thermal benefits of nest box roosting to reduce
   energy loss. This suggests that resource deficiency might be a stronger
   predictor of overnight survival than the threat of nocturnal predation
   in this system. As such, our study provides insights into the classic
   tradeoff between starvation and predation risk, in suggesting that
   priority is given to minimizing the risk of starvation in situations
   where both starvation and predation risks increase during cold winter
   nights.}},

Abstract = {{Four visual censuses targeting Octopus vulgaris living in dens on sandy
   bottoms were carried out from June to October 2013 in the National Park
   of the Atlantic Galician Islands (NW Spain). Censuses were undertaken by
   scuba diving between 5 and 21 m depth in daytime. The total area swept
   was 13.75 ha. There were no significant differences between octopus
   presence in dens during open and closed fishing seasons. Depth had a
   significant negative relationship with occupancy. The average number of
   dens per 1000 m(2) was 3.84 +/- 0.84 in June and 3.89 in October. The
   area per den was 260 m(2). Den number estimations varied between 1586
   and 2057. The largest number of dens (76.5\%) was found between 5 and 10
   m depth. Den distribution was clumped. No significant differences were
   found between octopus size classes (small, medium and large) and den
   diameter. Associate dens were observed. There were no significant
   differences in den diameter and shell types found around the middens.
   Many dens could be ``permanent{''}. Drilling bivalve shell behaviour is
   discussed. The surveyed area had around 1100 individuals, mainly small
   specimens. No significant differences were found between octopus size
   and depth. Substrate, den type and food abundance and availability
   (especially razors Ensis arcuatus) seem to be the main factors
   influencing dens and octopus density and distribution. Den availability
   does not appear to be a limiting factor in this case. Temperature, den
   availability, predators and fishing pressure influencing density and
   distribution are discussed. Rodas inlet may be a preferential habitat
   for O. vulgaris individuals ranging from 200 to 2000 g, but especially
   small specimens (<= 1000 g).}},

Abstract = {{The ability to adjust behavioral responses to environmental cues
   probably contributes to an individual's ability to persist in unfamiliar
   habitats. One behavior, how an individual responds to novelty,
   influences the acquisition of resources (e.g., novel foods) and
   identification of stressors, but it may also increase exposure to risks.
   Here, using house sparrows (Passer domesticus) recently introduced to
   Kenya, we tested how range expansion influenced individuals' responses
   to novel foods and objects. We predicted that range edge birds would be
   less averse to novelty than birds at the site of introduction and that
   this effect would be more pronounced for novel foods than novel
   non-nutritional items. We also expected range edge individuals to be
   more sensitive to changes in the environment and therefore more apt to
   adjust their behavior in response to different cues; in other words,
   individuals at the range edge would have a more flexible behavioral
   repertoire than individuals at the site of introduction. As predicted,
   individuals at the range edge ate novel foods faster than those from
   established areas; however, latency to touch novel objects did not vary
   across the range. Individuals throughout the range were variable in
   their response to novelty, but there was no indication that individual
   flexibility was greater at the range edge. Although many novel items
   might be useful to introduced organisms, novel foods are likely more
   valuable, and therefore individuals should be most apt to risk the
   potential costs associated with novelty for a high nutritional payoff.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: African American (AA) women have been shown to lose less
   weight than Caucasian women in response to behavioral interventions. Our
   objective was to examine adherence to intervention and metabolic factors
   that may explain this difference.
   DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We examined longitudinal changes in body weight and
   energy expenditure (EE), and objective assessment of physical activity
   (PA) and energy intake (EI) during 6 months of a weight-loss
   intervention program, including prescribed calorie restriction and
   increased PA in 66 Caucasian and 39 AA severely obese women. Comparisons
   were also made in 25 Caucasian and 25 AA women matched for initial body
   weight.
   RESULTS: The AA women lost 3.6 kg less weight than Caucasian women.
   Total daily EE (TDEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) adjusted for fat
   free mass (FFM) were significantly lower in the AA women, whereas the
   decrease in RMR in response to weight loss was greater in Caucasian
   women. Adherence to the prescribed PA and change in PA in response to
   intervention were similar in AA and Caucasian women. Prescribed EI (1794
   +/- 153 and 1806 +/- 153 kcal per day) and measured EI during
   intervention (2591 +/- 371 vs 2630 +/- 442 kcal per day) were nearly
   identical in matched AA and Caucasian women. However, the AA women lost
   significantly less body weight due to lower energy requirements (2924
   +/- 279 vs 3116 +/- 340 kcal per day; P<0.04), resulting in a lower
   energy deficit (333 +/- 210 vs 485 +/- 264 kcal per day).
   CONCLUSION: Adherence to the behavioral intervention was similar in AA
   and Caucasian women. However, neglecting to account for the lower energy
   requirements in AA women when calculating the energy prescription
   resulted in a lower level of calorie restriction and, hence, less body
   weight loss. Therefore, to achieve similar weight loss in AA women, the
   prescribed caloric restriction cannot be based on weight alone, but must
   be lower than in Caucasians, to account for lower energy requirements.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Plant-manipulating herbivores can modify their host nutrients and
   defensive compounds to their own advantage. This generally results in
   enhanced performance of herbivores on modified tissues, but the
   anatomical and biochemical modifications undergone by host tissues could
   also modify the herbivores' behaviour. Phloeomyzus passerinii induces a
   reaction tissue in the bark of its susceptible poplar hosts, suggesting
   a host-plant manipulation by the aphid. We investigated whether the
   formation of this reaction tissue, confirmed by histological sections,
   affected the performance and feeding behaviour of the aphid. In addition
   we studied how host resistance affected these parameters by comparing
   two host genotypes of different susceptibility. Aphids developed faster
   on the preinfested susceptible host genotype, whereas no effect was
   detected on the resistant one, confirming an improvement in the host's
   nutritional value due to the preinfestation, in agreement with the
   nutrition hypothesis. The DC-EPG technique indicated that in both host
   genotypes, preinfestation shortened the delay until the first probe and
   increased both the rate and duration of sustained ingestion, and
   consequently host acceptance. This suggests that host manipulation can
   adjust not only the nutritional value of plant tissues at an optimal
   level for development but also host acceptance by the herbivores. In the
   resistant host genotype though, the number of probes and the duration of
   parenchyma exploration increased in the galled tissue, which was
   congruent with extensive cell wall modifications indicated by more
   extended induced lignification. The adaptive consequences of this
   modified feeding behaviour are discussed. (C) 2014 The Association for

Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{121-127}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in sexual fidelity and extrapair paternity (EPP) is
   widely attributed to environmental heterogeneity, but the only variables
   known to be influential are food abundance and density of conspecific
   breeders (potential extrapair partners). Habitat structure is thought to
   impact EPP but is rarely measured and, when considered, is usually
   confounded with food abundance and predation pressure. To sidestep these
   confounds, we tested whether EPP is associated with habitat structure
   variables and with local conspecific density in a species whose nesting
   habitat is not used for feeding and lacks predators. In a blue-footed
   booby, Sula nebouxii, colony, the probability of EPP in a female's nest
   was highest in parts of the study plot where there were few obstacles to
   locomotion, and was quadratically related to local density of sexually
   active males, even though local males did not sire the EP chicks. The
   probability of a male breeder siring EP (extrapair) chicks elsewhere was
   quadratically related to local density of sexually active males around
   his nest. From these patterns we infer that both sexes may foray for EP
   interactions, that males and females nesting at intermediate density are
   most likely to be accessed by forayers, and that obstacles in the
   vicinity of a female's nest constrain access of foraying males. To our
   knowledge, this is the first demonstration that individual variation in
   EPP is associated with habitat structure in the absence of confounding
   variation in food availability, predation pressure or breeder quality,
   and the first evidence that EPP opportunities of female and male
   breeders are reduced by high density of conspecific breeders above a
   particular threshold. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{In a wide range of organisms, including humans, mothers can influence

   Gasterosteus aculeatus, were either exposed to predation risk while
   fathering or not. Fathers altered their paternal behaviour when exposed
   to predation risk, and consequently produced adult offspring with
   phenotypes associated with strong predation pressure (smaller size,
   reduced body condition, reduced behavioural activity). Moreover, more
   attentive fathers produced offspring that showed stronger antipredator
   responses. These results are consistent with behaviourally mediated
   paternal programming: fathers can alter offspring phenotypes to match
   their future environment and influence offspring traits well into

   Methods: The sample (n = 6798) was derived from the National Health and

   fit four logistic regression models to test whether neuroticism,
   extraversion, openness to experience, or the Type A behavior pattern

   Results: In Model 1 age was associated with increased risk of diabetes

   three-fold increase in risk. In Model 2 age and being black were still
   significant and extraversion was associated with decreased risk (17\%

Abstract = {{Dieting and the increased availability of highly palatable food are
   considered major contributing factors to the large incidence of eating
   disorders and obesity. This study was aimed at investigating the role of
   the cannabinoid (CB) system in a novel animal model of compulsive
   eating, based on a rapid palatable diet cycling protocol. Male Wistar
   rats were fed either continuously a regular chow diet (Chow/Chow,
   control group) or intermittently a regular chow diet for 2 days and a
   palatable, high-sucrose diet for 1 day (Chow/Palatable). Chow/Palatable
   rats showed spontaneous and progressively increasing hypophagia and body
   weight loss when fed the regular chow diet, and excessive food intake
   and body weight gain when fed the palatable diet. Diet-cycled rats
   dramatically escalated the intake of the palatable diet during the first
   hour of renewed access (7.5-fold compared to controls), and after
   withdrawal, they showed compulsive eating and heightened risk-taking
   behavior. The inverse agonist of the CB1 receptor, SR141716 reduced the
   excessive intake of palatable food with higher potency and the body
   weight with greater efficacy in Chow/Palatable rats, compared to
   controls. Moreover, SR141716 reduced compulsive eating and risk-taking
   behavior in Chow/Palatable rats. Finally, consistent with the behavioral
   and pharmacological observations, withdrawal from the palatable diet

Abstract = {{Calorie restriction (CR) was shown previously to improve cognition and
   decrease pathology in transgenic mouse models with Alzheimer-like
   amyloid deposition. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   CR on the Tg4510 model of tau deposition. Mice in the calorie
   restriction group had food intake gradually decreased until they reached
   an average of 35\% body weight reduction. Body weight and food intake
   were monitored throughout the study. After being on their respective
   diets for 3 months, all animals were submitted to behavioral testing.
   Tg4510 mice fed ad libitum showed lower body weight than nontransgenic
   littermates despite their increased food intake. Additionally, Tg4510
   showed increased locomotor activity in the open field regardless of
   diet. Calorie restricted Tg4510 mice performed significantly better than
   ad libitum fed mice in the novel object recognition test, suggesting
   improved short-term memory. CR Tg4510 mice also performed significantly
   better in contextual fear conditioning than mice fed ad libitum.
   However, in a modified version of the novelty test that allows for
   interaction with other mice instead of inanimate objects, CR was not
   able to rescue the deficit found in Tg4510 mice in this ethologically
   more salient version of the task. No treatment differences in motor
   performance or spatial memory were observed in the rotarod or radial arm
   water maze tests, respectively. Histopathological and biochemical
   assessments showed no diet-induced changes in total or phospho-tau
   levels. Moreover, increased activation of both astrocytes and microglia
   in Tg4510 mice was not rescued by calorie restriction. Taken together,
   our data suggests that, despite an apparent rescue of associative
   memory, CR had no consistent effects on pathological outcomes of a mouse
   model of tau deposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   of this research were as follows. (1) Under free-grazing conditions, the
   cloned sheep showed excellent climatic and ecological adaptability. In
   extreme temperature conditions ranging from -30 to 40 degrees C, the
   cloned sheep maintained acceptable body condition and behaved as other
   sheep. (2) The cloned sheep quickly adapted from a herd feeding strategy
   to the harsh environment and quickly exhibited a grazing regimen as

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{We present a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model for the quintessential
   keystone predator, the rocky-intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus.
   Based on first principles, DEB theory is used to illuminate underlying
   physiological processes (maintenance, growth, development, and
   reproduction), thus providing a framework to predict individual-level
   responses to environmental change. We parameterized the model for P.
   ochraceus using both data from the literature and experiments conducted
   specifically for the DEB framework. We devoted special attention to the
   model's capacity to (1) describe growth trajectories at different
   life-stages, including pelagic larval and post-metamorphic phases, (2)
   simulate shrinkage when prey availability is insufficient to meet
   maintenance requirements, and (3) deal with the combined effects of
   changing body temperature and food supply. We further validated the
   model using an independent growth data set. Using standard statistics to
   compare model outputs with real data (e.g. Mean Absolute Percent Error,
   MAPE) we demonstrated that the model is capable of tracking P.
   ochraceus' growth in length at different life-stages (larvae: MAPE =
   12.27\%; post-metamorphic, MAPE = 9.22\%), as well as quantifying
   reproductive output index. However, the model's skill dropped when
   trying to predict changes in body mass (MAPE = 24.59\%), potentially
   because of the challenge of precisely anticipating spawning events.
   Interestingly, the model revealed that P. ochraceus reserves contribute
   little to total biomass, suggesting that animals draw energy from
   structure when food is limited. The latter appears to drive
   indeterminate growth dynamics in P. ochraceus. Individual-based
   mechanistic models, which can illuminate underlying physiological
   responses, offer a viable framework for forecasting population dynamics
   in the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus. The DEB model herein
   represents a critical step in that direction, especially in a period of
   increased anthropogenic pressure on natural systems and an observed
   recent decline in populations of this keystone species.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined whether dietary supply of DHA and phospholipids
   during early ontogeny affected the outcome of behavioural challenges in
   pike perch larvae and fry, and whether the history of lipid nutrition
   carried over in long-term effects on learning ability. Pike perch larvae
   were fed Artemia enriched with either refined olive oil high in oleic
   acid (A); refined olive oil supplemented with a low (B) or a high (C)
   level of DHA; or refined olive oil acid supplemented with fish oil with
   a high content of phospholipids (PL) and DHA (D). The enriched live
   diets were provided until 28 days post hatch (dph), at which time larval
   behavioural responses to visual and mechano-sensory stimuli were
   assessed. All dietary groups were subsequently fed an identical enriched
   live feed (diet D) and gradually weaned to an extruded dry feed, on
   which they were maintained for 112 days. At the end of this period,
   assessment of fry avoidance behaviour was repeated and individuals were
   tested for spatial learning ability in a maze. At the larval stage,
   individuals maintained on Anemia rich in DHA showed a 5-8 fold increase
   in swimming speed when subjected to a visually simulated predator test,
   a response that was not observed for larvae on diets low in DHA content.
   Independent of the predator simulation, larvae deficient or low in DHA
   exhibited significantly more time swimming along the edge of a test
   arena and had overall higher locomotor activities compared to larvae fed
   a diet with a high DHA content. Larvae on DHA rich diets showed an
   ability to achieve significantly higher peak acceleration rates during
   the escape response, which was maintained at 112 dph. Time spent
   locating the exit of a maze decreased with repetitious training
   sessions, although fish fed diets low in DHA spent longer time in the
   maze, caused by extended periods of inactivity or ``freezing{''}
   behaviour (time lag) prior to the onset of active searching behaviour.
   The consistency of behavioural responses to mechano-sensory stimuli in
   larvae and fry suggests long-term effects on the neuromuscular path-way
   involved in escape responses. A longer period of freezing in the
   learning test may reflect a more anxious and fragile behaviour profile
   in fish fed low levels of DMA. Further studies should aim at verifying
   whether this affects performance related traits, such as immune
   competence and robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous

   supply to neurons. Here, we investigated the role of omega 3 fatty acids
   in altering neural energy metabolism and behavior of spontaneously
   hypertensive rats (SHR), which is an animal model of ADHD. To this end,
   we employed Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) to evaluate
   changes in brain neurochemistry in the SHR following consumption of one
   of three experimental diets (starting PND 21): fish oil enriched (FOE),
   regular (RD) and animal fat enriched CAFE) diet. Behavioral tests were
   performed to evaluate differences in locomotor activity and risk-taking
   behavior (starting PND 44). Comparison of frontal lobe metabolites
   showed that increased amounts of omega 3 fatty acids decreased total
   Creatine levels (tCr), but did not change Glutamate (Glu), total
   N-Acetylaspartate (tNAA), Lactate (Lac), Choline (Cho) or Inositol (Ino)

   levels of brain tCr and Glu exhibited greater hyperactivity in a
   familiar environment. On the other hand, risk-taking exploration of the
   elevated plus maze's open arms correlated negatively with forebrain tNAA
   and Lac levels. These findings support the possible alteration in energy
   metabolites in ADHD, correlating with hyperactivity in the animal model.

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic eating disorder affecting females and
   males, defined by body weight loss, higher physical activity levels and
   restricted food intake. Currently, the commonalities and differences
   between genders in etiology of AN are not well understood. Animal models
   of AN, such as activity-based anorexia (ABA), can be helpful in
   identifying factors determining individual susceptibility to AN. In ABA,
   rodents are given an access to a running wheel while food restricted,
   resulting in paradoxical increased physical activity levels and weight
   loss. Recent studies suggest that different behavioral traits, including
   voluntary exercise, can predict individual weight loss in ABA. A higher
   inherent drive for movement may promote development and severity of AN,
   but this hypothesis remains untested. In rodents and humans, drive for
   movement is defined as spontaneous physical activity (SPA), which is
   time spent in low-intensity, non-volitional movements. In this paper, we
   show that a profile of body weight history and behavioral traits,
   including SPA, can predict individual weight loss caused by ABA in male
   and female rats with high accuracy. Analysis of the influence of SPA on
   ABA susceptibility in males and females rats suggests that either high
   or low levels of SPA increase the probability of high weight loss in
   ABA, but with larger effects in males compared to females. These results
   suggest that the same behavioral profile can identify individuals
   at-risk of AN for both male and female populations and that SPA has
   predictive value for susceptibility to AN. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. State-dependent models (SDMs) of behaviour, based on dynamic
   fitness-maximizing optimality routines, offer a powerful approach to
   understanding the plasticity and complexity in the timing of behaviour
   of foraging animals; yet, they are rarely developed for individual
   species. Such models permit evaluation of the sensitivity of predicted
   behavioural patterns to parameters that describe the main elements of
   environmental risk and the dynamics of internal states, such as energy
   stores, that determine motivational state.
   2. Here, we develop a state-dependent dynamic model for the temporal
   organization of foraging in a cyclic environment, using the intertidal
   grazing limpet Cellana grata as a test species. Estimates of relevant
   parameter values were obtained wherever possible and a sensitivity
   analysis performed to estimate the relative importance of these
   parameters.
   3. The results demonstrated the value of constructing an optimality
   model of the combined effects of gut processing and food supply,
   alongside the costs and risks of foraging. The dynamic model was able to
   satisfactorily reproduce the foraging behaviour of the limpet and
   highlighted several emergent details of behaviour that were not
   immediately apparent or predicted using a more simple, static model.
   4. Ranking the importance of the different parameters in the foraging
   behaviour of the limpet helped to identify research priorities for
   further studies on these grazers. Among the investigated parameters,
   standing crop and gut volume appeared to be of greatest importance,
   while energy costs and ingestion rates were of relatively lower
   importance. Risks of mortality during the different phases also played a
   fundamental role, dictating the main temporal limits within which
   activity occurred.
   5. Even with the great number of parameters required with respect to
   simpler static models, the benefits of following such a dynamic approach
   were evident and outweighed the additional effort needed for their
   estimation, supporting the use of dynamic modelling approaches in future
   research into the behaviour of mobile consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing urban development can have significant effects on wildlife
   species, including carnivores. Some carnivore species have been able to
   adapt to and even thrive in urban environments, including coyotes (Canis
   latrans). The presence of carnivores in urban areas can sometimes lead
   to conflicts with humans and their pets. Although coyotes may frequently
   use urban areas, they also inhabit natural areas surrounding urban
   development. Understanding the various factors affecting patch choice of
   urban coyotes may assist wildlife officials in managing human-coyote
   conflicts. Both sex and behavioral profile can influence patch choice;
   bold individuals are more likely to be exploratory than shy animals,
   which can result in increased conflicts in urban environments. Using a
   captive population of coyotes, we tested whether coyotes preferred urban
   (anthropogenic) habitat structure, natural structure, or a mixture of
   structures and whether sex, behavioral profile, biological season, or
   food manipulation affected coyote patch choice. Coyotes generally
   preferred the control, homogeneous structure representing their natal
   habitat (mean percentage of time 23.3\% +/- 19.3 SD; P = 0.037). The
   next most preferred habitat for coyotes, especially females (23.7 +/-
   16.6\% for 25\% urban pen; P = 0.020) and bold coyotes (27.8 +/- 23.2\%
   for 75\% urban pen; P = 0.005), was a mixture of anthropogenic and
   natural structures rather than uniform structure (all natural or all
   anthropogenic), and this preference was more strongly expressed during
   the non-breeding season (25.6 +/- 23.2\% for 75\% urban pen; P = 0.017).
   Food had no effect on patch choice (P = 0.983); coyotes appeared to be
   primarily motivated by the structure of the habitat rather than by the
   amount of food within each habitat. Our results suggested that urban
   areas containing large amounts of both natural and anthropogenic
   structures are more likely to be used by coyotes and, thus, could have
   the potential for human-coyote conflicts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Road traffic noise modifies behaviour of a keystone species}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{135-141}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Prey species have to balance their foraging and vigilance behaviour in
   order to maximize nutritional and energetic intake while avoiding
   predation. Anthropogenic noise, a ubiquitous form of human disturbance,
   has the potential to influence antipredator behaviour through its
   effects on predator detection and perceived risk. Noise might increase
   perceived risk as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis, reduce
   risk by providing protection from disturbance-sensitive predators, or
   have no effect on antipredator behaviour if animals are tolerant of
   nonlethal forms of human disturbance. Road traffic is a pervasive source
   of anthropogenic noise, but few studies have experimentally isolated the
   effects of road noise on behaviour. Using systematic playback
   experiments, we investigated the influence of traffic noise on foraging
   and vigilance in a keystone species in North American prairie systems,
   the prairie dog, Cynomys ludovicianus. Exposure to road traffic noise
   significantly lowered aboveground activity, reduced foraging and
   increased vigilance, as predicted by the risk disturbance hypothesis.
   These effects were prevalent irrespective of temperature, a strong
   influence on such behaviours, and they were consistent across the
   3-month study period, providing no evidence of habituation. Our results
   provide the first experimental investigation of the potential costs of
   this ubiquitous disturbance in a free-ranging mammal, demonstrating that
   road noise can alter key survival behaviours of this ecologically
   pivotal species. These findings highlight that the presence of animals
   in a location is no guarantee of population and ecological integrity,
   while also underlining the potential synergistic impacts of noise on a
   species that has already experienced severe declines across its historic
   range due to human disturbance. Globally, roadways have profound impacts
   on biodiversity, and quantifying the behavioural and fitness costs
   associated with different forms of disturbance such as noise is crucial
   for mitigation. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are by definition stable over time, but to what
   extent they may change during development and in adulthood to adjust to
   environmental change is unclear. Animals of temperate environments have
   evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the
   cyclic seasonal changes. This may also result in changes in personality:
   suites of behavioural and physiological traits that vary consistently
   among individuals. Winter, typically the adverse season challenging
   survival, may require individuals to have shy/cautious personality,
   whereas during summer, energetically favourable to reproduction,
   individuals may benefit from a bold/risk-taking personality. To test the
   effects of seasonal changes in early life and in adulthood on behaviours
   (activity, exploration and anxiety), body mass and stress response, we
   manipulated the photoperiod and quality of food in two experiments to
   simulate the conditions of winter and summer. We used the common voles
   (Microtus arvalis) as they have been shown to display personality based
   on behavioural consistency over time and contexts. Summer-born voles
   allocated to winter conditions at weaning had lower body mass, a higher
   corticosterone increase after stress and a less active, more cautious
   behavioural phenotype in adulthood compared to voles born in and
   allocated to summer conditions. In contrast, adult females only showed
   plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone levels, which were higher in
   the animals that were transferred to the winter conditions than to those
   staying in summer conditions. These results suggest a sensitive period
   for season-related behavioural plasticity in which juveniles shift over
   the bold-shy axis.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic species can provide abundant food resources for native consumers,
   but predicting which native species will respond positively remains a
   challenge. We studied the foraging behavior of black-capped (Poecile
   atricapillus) and mountain (P. gambeli) chickadees in western Montana to
   compare the degree to which these congeric and syntopic consumers
   exploited larvae of Urophora, an exotic biological control insect living
   within the seedheads of the invasive forb, spotted knapweed (Centaurea
   stoebe). Chickadees typically forage within tree or shrub cover, whereas
   knapweed and hence Urophora larvae thrive in open grassland away from
   cover. We found that black-capped chickadees were much more likely than
   mountain chickadees to forage for Urophora. Black-capped chickadees
   strategically minimized time spent in open habitats by flying out from
   cover to retrieve knapweed seedheads and immediately returning to cover
   to extract the larvae. Black-capped chickadees also employed an atypical
   hovering technique nearly twice as often as their congeners did,
   particularly when foraging away from cover. Via this hovering technique,
   birds were able to gather knapweed seedheads from erect plants rather
   than searching for seedheads on the ground. These shifts in foraging
   behavior allowed black-capped chickadees to exploit Urophora larvae to a
   much greater degree than their congeners while minimizing exposure to a
   high-risk habitat, an outcome with potentially important community-wide
   consequences. Behavioral flexibility has been used to predict the
   success of invading species. We suggest that behavioral flexibility may
   also be used to predict how native species will respond to invasions,
   particularly the availability of exotic food resources.}},

Volume = {{457}},

Abstract = {{The nutritional status of an animal is maintained through a balance
   between energy intake and energy expenditure, and in the natural
   environment can fluctuate due to limited food availability and
   behavioural changes that remove the animal from its food. The integrated
   physiological processes that underlie an animal's nutritional status can
   be measured biophysically or biochemically. The Norway lobster Nephrops
   norvegicus has been shown to survive long periods of time without food,
   which is advantageous when food availability is low, such as during the
   winter months or when access to food is reduced due to risks associated
   with predation. In this study N. norvegicus was subjected to nutritional
   stress (starvation) for a period of 20 weeks and various biophysical
   measures (hepatosomatic index {[}HSI], length: weight ratio, tissue
   water content carbon: nitrogen ratio) and biochemical measures (copper,
   carbohydrate, lipids, protein, stable isotopes delta N-15 delta C-13)
   were used to determine how these animals maintain themselves over this
   period of forced starvation. Results indicate that while there was no
   variation in the whole weight of each individual, the organ-specific
   weight of the hepatopancreas (HSI) decreased and there was a
   corresponding increase in the water content of the hepatopancreas (and
   tail muscle). In contrast to the findings of previous studies, reserves
   of lipids decreased within the hepatopancreas. Fuel resources of protein
   from the tail muscle were not utilised, but reciprocal change in the
   copper content of the haemolymph to the hepatopancreas is suggestive of
   a breakdown of haemocyanin. The results provide an initial indication of
   how N. norvegicus can survive for long periods of time without food, and
   identify some potential biomarkers for starvation that can be applied to
   animals caught from the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Individual variation in behavioural traits (including responses to
   social cues) may influence the success of invasive populations. We
   studied the relationship between sociality and personality in invasive
   cane toads (Rhinella marina) from a recently established population in
   tropical Australia. In our field experiments, we manipulated social cues
   (the presence of a feeding conspecific) near a food source. We captured
   and compared toads that only approached feeding sites where another toad
   was already present, with conspecifics that approached unoccupied
   feeding sites. Subsequent laboratory trials showed correlated
   personality differences (behavioural syndromes) between these two groups
   of toads. For example, toads that approached already-occupied rather
   than unoccupied feeding sites in the field, took longer to emerge from a
   shelter-site in standardized trials, suggesting these individuals are
   `shy' (whereas toads that approached unoccupied feeding stations tended
   to be `bold'). Manipulating hunger levels did not abolish this
   difference. In feeding trials, a bold toad typically outcompeted a shy
   toad under conditions of low prey availability, but the outcome was
   reversed when multiple prey items were present. Thus, both personality
   types may be favored under different circumstances. This invasive
   population of toads contains individuals that exhibit a range of
   personalities, hinting at the existence of a wide range of social
   dynamics in taxa traditionally considered to be asocial.}},

Title = {{Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Increases Postnatal Acceptability of Nicotine
   Odor and Taste in Adolescent Rats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Human studies indicate that alcohol exposure during gestation not only
   increases the chance for later alcohol abuse, but also nicotine
   dependence. The flavor attributes of both alcohol and nicotine can be
   important determinants of their initial acceptance and they both share
   the component chemosensory qualities of an aversive odor, bitter taste
   and oral irritation. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating
   epigenetic chemosensory mechanisms through which fetal alcohol exposure
   increases adolescent alcohol acceptance, in part, by decreasing the
   aversion to alcohol's bitter and oral irritation qualities, as well as
   its odor. Given that alcohol and nicotine have noteworthy chemosensory
   qualities in common, we investigated whether fetal exposure to alcohol
   increased the acceptability of nicotine's odor and taste in adolescent
   rats. Study rats were alcohol-exposed during fetal development via the
   dams' liquid diet. Control animals received ad lib access to an
   iso-caloric, iso-nutritive diet throughout gestation. Odorant-induced
   innate behavioral responses to nicotine odor (Experiment 1) or
   orosensory-mediated responses to nicotine solutions (Experiment 2) were
   obtained, using whole-body plethysmography and brief access lick tests,
   respectively. Compared to controls, rats exposed to fetal alcohol showed
   an enhanced nicotine odor response that was paralleled by increased oral
   acceptability of nicotine. Given the common aversive component qualities
   imbued in the flavor profiles of both drugs, our findings demonstrate
   that like postnatal alcohol avidity, fetal alcohol exposure also
   influences nicotine acceptance, at a minimum, by decreasing the aversion
   of both its smell and taste. Moreover, they highlight potential
   chemosensory-based mechanism(s) by which fetal alcohol exposure
   increases the later initial risk for nicotine use, thereby contributing
   to the co-morbid expression with enhanced alcohol avidity. Where common
   chemosensory mechanisms are at play, our results suggest broader
   implications related to the consequence of fetal exposure with one
   substance of abuse and initial acceptability of others.}},

Title = {{Effects of Voluntary Alcohol Intake on Risk Preference and Behavioral
   Flexibility during Rat Adolescence}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{Alcohol use is common in adolescence, with a large portion of intake
   occurring during episodes of binging. This pattern of alcohol
   consumption coincides with a critical period for neurocognitive
   development and may impact decision-making and reward processing. Prior
   studies have demonstrated alterations in adult decision-making following
   adolescent usage, but it remains to be seen if these alterations exist
   in adolescence, or are latent until adulthood. Here, using a
   translational model of voluntary binge alcohol consumption in
   adolescents, we assess the impact of alcohol intake on risk preference
   and behavioral flexibility during adolescence. During adolescence
   (postnatal day 30-50), rats were given 1-hour access to either a 10\%
   alcohol gelatin mixture (EtOH) or a calorie equivalent gelatin (Control)
   at the onset of the dark cycle. EtOH consuming rats were classified as
   either High or Low consumers based on intake levels. Adolescent rats
   underwent behavioral testing once a day, with one group performing a
   risk preference task, and a second group performing a reversal-learning
   task during the 20-day period of gelatin access. EtOH-High rats showed
   increases in risk preference compared to Control rats, but not EtOH-Low
   animals. However, adolescent rats did a poor job of matching their
   behavior to optimize outcomes, suggesting that adolescents may adopt a
   response bias. In addition, adolescent ethanol exposure did not affect
   the animals' ability to flexibly adapt behavior to changing reward
   contingencies during reversal learning. These data support the view that
   adolescent alcohol consumption can have short-term detrimental effects
   on risk-taking when examined during adolescence, which does not seem to
   be attributable to an inability to flexibly encode reward contingencies
   on behavioral responses.}},

Abstract = {{Diseases caused by impaired regulation of energy balance, in particular
   obesity, represent a major global health burden. Although polymorphisms,
   lifestyle and dietary choices have been associated with differential
   risk of obesity and related conditions, a substantial proportion of the
   variation in disease risk remains unexplained. Evidence from
   epidemiological studies, natural experiments and from studies in animal
   models has shown that a poor intra-uterine environment is associated
   causally with increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease in
   adulthood. Induction of phenotypes that increase disease risk involves
   the fetus receiving cues from the mother about the environment which,
   via developmental plasticity, modify the phenotype of the offspring to
   match her environment However, inaccurate information may induce an
   offspring phenotype that is mismatched to the future environment. Such
   mismatch has been suggested to underlie increased risk of metabolic
   disease associated with a poor early life environment. Recent studies
   have shown that induction of modified phenotypes in the offspring
   involves altered epigenetic regulation of specific genes. Identification
   of a central role of epigenetics in the aetiology of obesity and
   metabolic disease may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic
   interventions and of biomarkers of disease risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Understanding how different herbivores make forage patch use choices
   explains how they maintain an adequate nutritional status, which is
   important for effective conservation management of grazing ecosystems.
   Using telemetry data, we investigated nonruminant zebra (Equus
   burchelli) and ruminant red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus subspecies
   camaa), use of burnt patches in a landscape mosaic of nutrient-poor, old
   grassland interspersed with young, recently burnt, nutrient-rich grass
   patches. The Mkambati Nature Reserve landscape on the east coast of
   South Africa provided large grazers with a challenge in finding and
   using appropriate patches in which to forage to meet their nutritional
   requirements. In Mkambati, grassland fires, mostly ignited by poachers,
   induce regrowth of young nutrient-rich grass, which subsequently attract
   grazers. We tested if the study animals foraged more in burnt patches
   than in the unburned grassland and whether burnt patch use was related
   to the distance to the previously visited burnt patch, burnt patch size,
   burnt patch age, and distance to areas with high poaching risk using
   MANOVA. In general, zebra moved faster than red hartebeest, and both
   species moved faster in unburnt grassland than in burnt patches. Red
   hartebeest and zebra patch selection were influenced by interpatch
   distance, patch age, patch size, and poaching risk. A limited set of
   intrinsic traits, i.e., body mass, digestion strategy, and muzzle width,
   yielded different patch use rules for the two species. Large ungulates
   patch use behaviour varied among species and across conditions and was
   influenced by anthropogenic impacts such as poaching and changed fire
   regimes. This could potentially affect biodiversity negatively and needs
   to be factored into management of conservation areas.}},
