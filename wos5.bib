Title = {{Aversion for bitter taste reveals sexual differences in alimentation
   strategies in a praying mantis}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Insects, as well as vertebrates, possess morphological, physiological
   and behavioural sexual dimorphisms. Because they are commonly bigger and
   produce eggs, female insects usually require more and specific energy
   intake. In addition to quantitative and qualitative requirements in food
   for reproduction, animals also have to avoid eating lethal toxins. The
   praying mantis Tenodera aridifolia is a good model to investigate sexual
   differences in feeding behaviour because its sexual dimorphism is marked
   in terms of morphology and behaviour. Here, we observed that females ate
   approximately four times as much prey as males. We then investigated the
   attacking and feeding behaviours of praying mantises by presenting
   mealworms injected with bitter solutions (quinine hydrochloride
   dihydrate or denatonium benzoate at 50 or 500 mM) as prey. We observed
   that males had a low level of acceptance for bitter prey: unlike
   females, they reduced consumption of mealworms injected with 50 mM of
   these bitter solutions. However, they showed higher motivation (unlike
   females, their rate of attack on prey increased when they reduced their
   consumption of mealworms). This difference in ingestion between the
   sexes did not seem to be due to different sensitivities for these bitter
   solutions (there was no detectable difference between the sexes in time
   taken to drink drops of these bitter solutions). Instead, this seems
   related to males and females having different feeding strategies based
   on different nutritive requirements. The possible effects of nutritional
   composition of prey on avoidance behaviours in predatory insects are
   discussed. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{115-120}},

Abstract = {{Sociability in animals provides benefits such as reduced predation risk
   and increased foraging efficiency. During the early stages of invasion,
   individuals are often vulnerable as part of a small population (Allee
   effects); associations with native heterospecifics could mitigate some
   of the disadvantages of small population size and thereby increase the
   chances of establishment success. Here we explored two potential
   benefits of heterospecific association to guppies, Poecilia reticulata,
   a very successful invasive species. We first investigated whether
   guppies can exploit visual cues from morphologically similar
   heterospecific individuals as effectively as those from conspecifics. We
   next tested whether willingness to explore an unfamiliar environment
   depends on whether guppies are accompanied by conspecifics or
   heterospecifics. Our results show that guppies can acquire information
   on food availability from another species, as well as from conspecifics.
   We also found that guppies engaged in exploratory behaviour more quickly
   if the habitat had plants in it, and were more likely to associate if it
   was unstructured; there was, however, no difference in the frequency
   with which the focal fish was accompanied by a conspecific or a
   heterospecific individual. These results show that guppies respond to
   these heterospecifics as they do with conspecifics. Our study reveals
   some of the traits that could make an invader successful and potentially
   help to identify species with a higher potential to become established
   outside their native range. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3143-3155}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Food odors stimulate appetite and innate food-seeking behavior in hungry
   animals. The smell of food also induces salivation and release of
   gastric acid and insulin. Conversely, sustained odor exposure may induce
   satiation. We demonstrate novel effects of food odors on food ingestion,
   metabolism and endocrine signaling in Drosophila melanogaster. Acute
   exposure to attractive vinegar odor triggers a rapid and transient
   increase in circulating glucose, and a rapid upregulation of genes
   encoding the glucagon-like hormone adipokinetic hormone (AKH), four
   insulin-like peptides (DILPs) and some target genes in peripheral
   tissues. Sustained exposure to food odors, however, decreases food
   intake. Hunger-induced strengthening of synaptic signaling from
   olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to brain neurons increases food-seeking
   behavior, and conversely fed flies display reduced food odor sensitivity
   and feeding. We show that increasing the strength of OSN signaling
   chronically by genetic manipulation of local peptide neuromodulation
   reduces feeding, elevates carbohydrates and diminishes lipids.
   Furthermore, constitutively strengthened odor sensitivity altered gene
   transcripts for AKH, DILPs and some of their targets. Thus, we show that
   food odor can induce a transient anticipatory endocrine response, and
   that boosted sensitivity to this odor affects food intake, as well as
   metabolism and hormonal signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in life-history traits can have major impacts on the

   many once-limited resources, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, with
   potentially major implications for the expression and evolution of life
   history trade-offs. In this review, we synthesize contemporary life
   history and sexual selection literature with current research on
   ecosystem nutrient cycling to highlight novel opportunities presented by
   anthropogenic environmental change for investigating life-history trait
   development and evolution. Specifically, we review four areas where
   nutrition plays a pivotal role in life-history evolution and explore
   possible implications in the face of rapid, human-induced change in
   nutrient availability. For example, increases in the availability of
   nutrients may relax historical life-history trade-offs and reduce the
   honesty of signaling systems. We argue that ecosystems experiencing

Abstract = {{Intraspecific aggression is an important aspect of social behaviour that
   can significantly affect individual survivorship and population
   dynamics. Aggressiveness may be particularly important in food-deprived
   habitats, like caves, but few studies have investigated behavioural and
   ecological determinants of aggressiveness and cannibalism in cave
   vertebrates. In this study, we evaluated the role of density,
   competition for food, starvation and rearing history under cave-like
   conditions in promoting aggression. We performed a behavioural
   experiment on larvae collected from multiple underground springs and
   neighbouring streams, and we reared them under two different settings:
   total darkness and outdoor conditions. Intraspecific attacks were very
   scarce in hatchlings, and increased after 1 month. Starvation periods
   and high density clearly increased aggressiveness. Furthermore,
   aggressiveness strongly increased under competition conditions (presence
   of other larvae feeding). Aggressiveness increased with age more quickly
   in larvae from caves than in those from streams. Environmental features
   typically experienced by cave populations, such as starvation and high
   density, increase intraspecific attacks and might promote cannibalism.
   Strong plasticity for aggression may enhance the possibility to
   successfully colonize and exploit food-deprived environments where no

Abstract = {{Environmental variation is a potent force affecting phenotypic
   expression. While freshwater fishes have provided a compelling example
   of the link between the environment and phenotypic diversity, few
   studies have been conducted with arid-zone fishes, particularly those
   that occur in geographically isolated regions where species typically
   inhabit intermittent and ephemeral creeks. We investigated morphological
   variation of a freshwater fish (the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia
   australis) inhabiting creeks in the Pilbara region of northwest
   Australia to determine whether body shape variation correlated with
   local environmental characteristics, including water velocity, habitat
   complexity, predator presence, and food availability. We expected that
   the geographic isolation of creeks within this arid region would result
   in habitat-specific morphological specializations. We used
   landmark-based geometric morphometrics to quantify the level of
   morphological variability in fish captured from 14 locations within
   three distinct subcatchments of a major river system. Western
   rainbowfish exhibited a range of morphologies, with variation in body
   depth accounting for a significant proportion (>42\%) of the total
   variance in shape. Sexual dimorphism was also apparent, with males
   displaying deeper bodies than females. While the measured local habitat
   characteristics explained little of the observed morphological
   variation, fish displayed significant morphological differentiation at
   the level of the subcatchment. Local adaptation may partly explain the
   geographic patterns of body shape variation, but fine-scale genetic
   studies are required to disentangle the effects of genetic
   differentiation from environmentally determined phenotypic plasticity in
   body shape. Developing a better understanding of environment-phenotype
   relationships in species from arid regions will provide important
   insights into ecological and evolutionary processes in these unique and

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Predation is a major factor driving evolution, and organisms have
   evolved adaptations increasing their survival chances. However, most
   defenses incur trade-offs between benefits and costs. Many organisms
   save costs by employing inducible defenses as responses to fluctuating
   predation risk. The level of defense often increases with predator
   densities. However, individual predation risk should not only depend on
   predator density but also on the density of conspecifics. If the
   predator has a saturating functional response one would predict a
   negative correlation between prey density and individual predation risk
   and hence defense expression. Here, we tested this hypothesis using six
   model systems, covering a taxonomic range from protozoa to rotifers and
   crustaceans. In all six systems, we found that the level of defense
   expression increased with predator density but decreased with prey
   density. In one of our systems, i.e. in Daphnia, we further show that
   the response to prey density is triggered by a chemical cue released by
   conspecifics and congeners. Our results indicate that organisms adjust
   the degree of defense to the acute predation risk, rather than merely to
   predators' densities. Our study suggests that density-dependent defense
   expression reflects accurate predation-risk assessment and is a general
   principle in many inducible-defense systems.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Food abundance and availability affect flock patterns of
   foraging birds. Cost and risk tradeoffs are especially critical for
   flocks of wintering waterbirds foraging in lake wetlands. Waterbirds
   losing suitable habitats face insufficient food supplies and high levels
   of disturbance, affecting their foraging activities. Our objective was
   to study the effects of food abundance and disturbances on flock size
   and the structure of Hooded Crane flocks wintering at Shengjin Lake and,
   as well, to understand the response of wintering waterbirds to habitat
   degradation for future management decisions and protection of the
   population.
   Methods: We investigated food abundance, disturbances and flock foraging
   activities of the wintering Hooded Crane in several foraging habitats of
   Shengjin Lake from November 2013 to April 2014. Flock size and structure
   were observed by scan sampling. Data on food abundance and disturbances
   were collected by sampling. Flock size and structure were compared among
   three wintering stages. The relationship between food resources,
   disturbances and flock size were illustrated using a generalized linear
   model.
   Results: In the early and middle wintering periods, the Hooded Crane
   used paddy fields as its major foraging habitat, where the number of
   foraging birds and flocks were the highest. During the late period, the
   cranes took to meadows as their major foraging habitat. The variation
   among foraging flock was mainly embodied in the size of the flocks,
   while the age composition of these flocks did not change perceptibly.
   Family flocks were notably different from flock groups in size and age
   composition. The results of a generalized linear model showed that the
   food abundance had a marked effect on foraging flock size and age
   composition, while disturbances had a significant effect only on flock
   size. From our analysis, it appeared that the combined effect of the two
   variables was significant on the size of the foraging flock, but had
   less impact on age composition.
   Conclusions: Food abundance and disturbances affected the flock size of
   the Hooded Crane. With abundant food and high disturbances, flock sizes
   increased owing to cooperation in foraging. To avoid competition and
   maximize foraging benefits, flock size reduces with an abundance of food
   but low disturbance. By trading off risks and costs, the cranes showed
   flexible flock distributions and a variety of foraging strategies to
   maximize benefits and to improve their fitness.}},

   is an increasing recognition that adolescence is an important time for
   lifestyle and health behaviours to become embedded. Improving these
   behaviours in adolescents is important not only for their own health but
   also for that of their future children. LifeLab Southampton has been
   developed as a purpose-built classroom and laboratory in University
   Hospital Southampton. Secondary school students visit LifeLab to learn
   how childhood, adolescent and parental nutrition influences health,
   understand the impact of their lifestyle on their cardiovascular and
   metabolic health, and to inspire them with the excitement of research
   and future career possibilities in science. The LifeLab visit is part of
   a programme of work linked to the English National Curriculum. Pilot
   work has indicated that attitudes towards health can be changed by such
   LifeLab sessions.
   Methods/Design: A cluster randomised controlled trial is being conducted
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the LifeLab intervention, the primary
   outcome being a measurement of the change in nutrition, health and
   lifestyle literacy from before to after the LifeLab intervention. The
   LifeLab intervention comprises professional development for the teachers
   involved; preparatory lessons for the school students, delivered in
   school; a hands-on practical day at LifeLab, including a `Meet the
   Scientist' session; post-visit lessons delivered in school; and the
   opportunity to participate in the annual LifeLab Schools' Conference.
   This study aims to recruit approximately 2,500 secondary school students
   aged 13 to 14 years from 32 schools (the clusters) from Southampton and
   neighbouring areas. Participating schools will be randomised to control
   or intervention groups. The intervention will be run over two academic
   school years, with baseline questionnaire data collected from students
   at participating schools at the start of the academic year and follow-up
   questionnaire data collected approximately 12 months later.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: An individual's fitness in part depends on the
   characteristics of the mate so that sexually attractive ornaments, as
   signals of quality, are used in mate choice. Often such ornaments
   develop already early in life and thus are affected by nutritional
   conditions experienced then. Individuals thus should benefit by
   compensating as soon as possible for poor initial development of
   ornaments, to be attractive already at sexual maturity. Here, we tested
   whether early nutritional stress affects the cheek patch size of male
   Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), which are important in mate choice,
   and whether a small cheek patch size early on is compensated at sexual
   maturation. Furthermore we tested whether exploration behaviour is
   affected by such a compensation, as shown for other compensatory growth
   trajectories.
   Results: Zebra finch males which were raised under poorer nutritional
   conditions initially expressed smaller cheek patches at day 50
   post-hatching but then compensated in cheek patch size already at 65
   days, i.e. when becoming sexually mature. Furthermore, compensatory
   growth in cheek patch during adolescence was negatively correlated with
   activity and exploration behaviour, measured in a novel environment.
   Conclusion: This compensation in cheek patch size benefits male
   attractiveness but also was related to less exploration behaviour, an
   established proxy for avian personality traits. We discuss the
   possibility that compensatory priorities exist so that not all deficits
   from a bad start are caught-up at the same time. Resource allocation to
   compensate for poorly expressed traits is likely to have evolved to
   optimise traits by the time they are most beneficial.}},

   split-brood design allowing us to separate maternal and genetic effects
   from early rearing effects. Adult provisioning behaviour was monitored
   on day four and day eight after hatching using video recordings.
   Individual nestlings were subjected to a handling stress test at an age
   of 14 days, which is a validated proxy for exploratory behaviour as an
   adult.
   Results: Variation in handling stress was mainly determined by the
   rearing environment. We show that, contrary to our predictions, not the
   amount of spider biomass, but the amount of caterpillar biomass
   delivered per nestling significantly affected individual performance in
   the stress test. Chicks provisioned with lower amounts of caterpillars
   exhibited a stronger stress response, reflecting faster exploratory
   behaviour later on in life, than individuals who received larger amounts
   of caterpillars.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that natural variation in parental
   behaviour in wild birds modulates the developmental trajectories of
   their offspring's personality via food provisioning. Since parental
   provisioning behaviour might also reflect the local environmental
   conditions, provisioning behaviour may influence how nestlings respond
   to these local environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{There is limited research on the maternal and infant characteristics
   associated with the timing of solid food introduction. The current study
   examined how maternal feeding style and infant temperament independently
   and interactively predicted the age at which infants were introduced to

   collected when infants were 4 and 6 months of age. The timing of solid
   food introduction was positively correlated with mothers' age,
   education, breastfeeding at 4 months, self-reported responsiveness to
   infants' hunger and satiety cues, and negatively correlated with
   mothers' pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), beliefs about feeding
   infants solid food prior to 6 months of age, and infants' temperamental
   motor reactivity. When controlling for maternal age, education,
   pre-pregnancy BMI, and milk feeding method at 4 months, the timing of
   solid food introduction was negatively predicted by mothers' beliefs
   about feeding solid food prior to 6 months of age. Exploratory

Abstract = {{Daphnia lumholtzi is an exotic species of zooplankton that was first
   introduced in Texas, U.S.A., and has since spread across most of the
   areas in the country. Research has focussed on the importance of the
   production of morphological defences in response to predator exposure as
   a key explanation for the spread of this species. Very little is known
   about the influence of other common environmental stressors on the
   fitness of this species or the potential role for genetic variation in
   plasticity in the spread of this species. We assessed the effects of two
   common environmental stressors, invertebrate predator cues and
   increasing concentrations of cyanobacteria, on the life-history traits
   in D.lumholtzi. This study also included clones from three reservoirs in
   Texas to measure potential genetic variation in plasticity. We found
   that the expression of life-history traits depended strongly upon the
   combined effects of predator exposure and food quality. Increasing
   concentrations of cyanobacteria resulted in delayed maturation, slower
   growth, a smaller size at maturation, declines in clutch size and slower
   rate of population growth. Yet, such declines were much smaller in the
   presence of predator cues. Divergent responses observed were the size of
   defence traits; Daphnia reared in the absence of predator cues increased
   the size of spines as the concentrations of cyanobacteria increased,
   while the opposite pattern was observed in the presence of predator
   cues. This study also revealed extensive genetic variation in the
   magnitude and direction of phenotypic responses to predators and
   cyanobacteria. These latter results illustrate that significant clonal
   variation in plasticity may help promote the spread of this species.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is theorized
   to have temperamental precursors early in life. These are difficult to
   identify because many core features of ADHD, such as breakdowns in
   executive function and self-control, involve psychological and neural
   systems that are too immature to reliably show dysfunction in early
   life. ADHD also involves emotional dysregulation, and these
   temperamental features appear earlier as well. Here, we report a first
   attempt to utilize indices of emotional regulation to identify
   ADHD-related liability in infancy.
   MethodsFifty women were recruited in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy,
   with overselection for high parental ADHD symptoms. Measures of maternal
   body mass index, nutrition, substance use, stress, and mood were
   examined during pregnancy as potential confounds. Offspring were
   evaluated at 6months of age using LABTAB procedures designed to elicit
   fear, anger, and regulatory behavior. Mothers completed the Infant
   Behavior Questionnaire about their child's temperament.
   ResultsAfter control for associated covariates, including maternal
   depression and prenatal stress, family history of ADHD was associated
   with measures of anger/irritability, including infant negative
   vocalizations during the arm restraint task (p=.004), and maternal
   ratings of infant distress to limitations (p=.036). In the regulation
   domain, familial ADHD was associated with less parent-oriented attention
   seeking during the still face procedure (p<.001), but this was not
   echoed in the maternal ratings of recovery from distress.
   ConclusionsAffective response at 6months of age may identify infants
   with familial history of ADHD, providing an early indicator of ADHD
   liability. These preliminary results provide a foundation for further
   studies and will be amplified by enlarging this cohort and following
   participants longitudinally to evaluate ADHD outcomes.}},

   challenges imposed by unpredictable perturbations ultimately are linked
   to cognitive abilities allowing the solving of problems, and the

Abstract = {{Global change affects individual phenotypes and biotic interactions,
   which can have cascading effects up to the ecosystem level. However, the
   role of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity in species
   interactions is poorly understood, leaving a substantial gap in our
   knowledge of the impacts of global change on ecosystems. Using a
   cla-doceran-dragonfly system, we experimentally investigated the effects
   of thermal acclimation, acute temperature change and enrichment on
   predator functional response and metabolic rate. Using our experimental
   data, we next parameterized a population dynamics model to determine the
   consequences of these effects on trophic interaction strength and
   food-chain stability. We found that (1) predation and metabolic rates of
   the dragonfly larvae increase with acute warming, (2) warm-acclimated
   larvae have a higher maximum predation rate than cold-acclimated ones,
   and (3) long-term interaction strength increases with enrichment but
   decreases with both acclimation and acute temperatures. Overall, our
   experimental results show that thermal acclimation can buffer negative
   impacts of environmental change on predators and increase food-web
   stability and persistence. We conclude that the effect of acclimation
   and, more generally, phenotypic plasticity on trophic interactions
   should not be overlooked if we aim to understand the effects of climate

Abstract = {{Underserved minority communities have few resources for addressing
   comorbidity risk reduction among long-term cancer survivors. To address
   this community need, we developed and piloted the Bronx Oncology Living
   Daily (BOLD) Healthy Living program, the first known diabetes prevention
   and control program to target cancer survivors and co-survivors in Bronx
   County, NY. The program aimed to facilitate lifestyle change and improve
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL) through weekly group nutrition
   education (60-90 min) and exercise (60 min) classes. We examined
   baseline characteristics of participants using simple descriptive
   statistics and evaluated program implementation and impact using the
   Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
   framework. The curriculum, which drew from the social-ecological
   framework and motivational and cognitive behavioral strategies,
   consisted of 12 culturally and medically tailored modules with options
   for implementation as a 12- or 4-week program. Seven programs (four 12
   weeks and three 4 weeks in length, respectively) were implemented at
   five community site locations. Sixty-six cancer survivors and 17 cancer
   co-survivors (mean age 60.5 +/- 10.2 years) enrolled in one of the
   programs. Most participants were female (95.2 \%) minority (55.4 \%
   black, 26.5 \% Hispanic/Latino) breast cancer survivors (75.7 \%).
   Median program attendance was 62.5 \% and did not significantly differ
   by program length; however, 67.3 \% of participants achieved a parts per
   thousand yen60 \% attendance among the 12-week programs, compared to
   41.9 \% among the 4-week programs, and this difference was statistically
   significant (p = 0.02). Overall, participants reported significant
   pre/post improvements in perceived health as good/excellent (66.0 to
   75.5 \%; p = 0.001) and borderline significant decreases in perceived
   pain as moderate/severe (45.5 to 38.2 \%; p = 0.05). More than 90 \% of
   participants reported that the program helped them to achieve their
   short-term goals, motivated them to engage in healthier behaviors, and
   felt that the nutrition and exercise classes were relevant to their
   needs. These results indicate that a short-term lifestyle intervention
   program for adult cancer survivors was acceptable in our community and
   motivated cancer survivors to improve their HRQoL. The curriculum can be
   used as a tool to facilitate development of similar programs in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, it has been recognized that in many animal
   species, individuals present consistent behavioral differences across
   time and/or contexts, thus defining personality traits. A general
   relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild
   populations, which raises the question as to how variation in
   personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating
   selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute
   to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild
   populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we
   investigated the relationship between individual personality differences
   and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a
   population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences
   considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated
   trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using
   capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a
   1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus
   ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found
   that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food
   availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability.
   Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to
   maintaining variation in boldness in the study population.}},

Abstract = {{The mystery surrounding how plant neurotoxins came to possess

   propose a resolution to this paradox whereby dopamine - which has

   aversion and encouraged escape. We suggest that after being consumed,
   plant neurotoxins such as nicotine activated an aversive dopaminergic
   pathway, thereby deterring predatory herbivores. Later evolutionary
   events - including the development of a GABAergic system capable of
   modulating dopaminergic activity - led to the ability to down-regulate
   and `control' this dopamine-based aversion. We speculate that this
   negative reinforcement system evolved so that animals could suppress
   aversive states such as hunger in order to attend to other internal
   drives (such as mating and shelter) that would result in improved

Abstract = {{The global pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is often causally

   Epidemiological studies in humans and controlled animal intervention
   studies have now shown that nutritional programming in early periods of

   throughout life. This link is conceptualised as the developmental
   programming hypothesis whereby environmental influences during critical
   periods of developmental plasticity can elicit lifelong effects on the
   health and well-being of the offspring. The mechanisms by which early
   environmental insults can have long-term effects on offspring remain
   poorly defined. However there is evidence from intervention studies
   which indicate altered wiring of the hypothalamic circuits that regulate
   energy balance and epigenetic effects including altered DNA methylation
   of key adipokines including leptin. Studies that elucidate the
   mechanisms behind these associations will have a positive impact on the

Abstract = {{Current fishing extraction methods often generate huge quantities of
   dead or dying biomass that is returned to the sea in the form of
   discards. This practice produces a readily available clumped resource
   for many scavengers such as seabirds, but in the face of declining
   stocks and via policy change, the amount of discards produced is set to
   decline in the future. To understand how discards have influenced
   seabird foraging in the past and how birds may respond to future change
   requires studies examining consistent individual foraging choices. There
   is increasing evidence that populations may be made up of generalist or
   specialist foragers and this is key to the population's ability to adapt
   to change. Here we test for consistent individual foraging behaviour of
   northern gannets Morus bassanus in relation to fishing vessels and
   examine consequences of scavenging behaviour in terms of foraging effort
   and body condition. Using a combination of bird-borne bio-logging
   devices (GPS and Time Depth Recorders) with high resolution GPS data
   acquired through vessel monitoring systems on fishing boats, we examined
   the overlap between birds and fisheries. We found that during repeat
   foraging trips in the same breeding season, gannets regularly foraged at
   fishing boats but there were also clear among individual differences in
   the extent of fisheries overlap. Furthermore, we show for the first time
   that these differences represent consistent strategies - individual
   differences in scavenging were highly repeatable across multiple trips
   within a period of several weeks. However, despite this finding, we
   found no differences in foraging effort or body condition between
   scavengers and non-scavengers. Moreover, scavenging strategy did not
   appear to influence diving behaviour or vary by sex. Scavenging on
   discards appears to be a strategy employed consistently by a subsection
   of the population and future work should examine whether these
   specialisations persist throughout and between years and what causes
   these individual differences, exploring possible demographic and fitness
   consequences in light of global changes to fish stocks and fisheries

Abstract = {{Stopover behavior of migrant birds is influenced by their energetic
   condition, but also by extrinsic factors, including weather conditions
   and habitat attributes such as vegetation structure, microclimates,
   predation pressure, competition, and food availability. Anthropogenic
   habitats may differ from natural habitats in these attributes, which
   could promote differing stopover behaviors for migrants in the two
   habitat types and affect overall habitat suitability. We used
   radio-telemetry to measure stopover behaviors of fall migrant
   yellow-rumped warblers Setophaga coronata in native riparian corridor
   woodlands (corridors) and anthropogenic woodlots (woodlots) in the
   Northern Prairie region. We measured stopover duration, movement rate,
   and temporary home range size for birds in both habitat types by
   attaching radio-transmitters and relocating birds to either corridor (n
   = 17) or woodlot (n = 16) study sites. We used AIC(C) to rank null,
   global, and reduced models, which included habitat type, energetic
   condition, habitat size, year, date, and movement rate (for stopover
   duration analyses only) as explanatory variables. Model rankings showed
   that habitat type was not included in any of the top models (Delta
   AIC(C) < 2) for movement behavior, temporary home range size, or
   stopover duration, which suggests similar functional habitat quality
   between the two habitat types. These data add similar behavioral
   responses for birds in the two habitat types to similar fattening rates
   and stress physiology, further confirming similar suitability of native
   and anthropogenic woodland habitats in this region as stopover habitat.
   We also applied logistic regression with a model selection approach,
   including cloud cover, tail wind component, temperature, and barometric
   pressure as independent variables, and departure decision as the
   dependent variable, to evaluate the effects of weather variables on
   departure. Model selection suggested that cloud cover is a prominent
   factor affecting departure decisions and the other variables may also
   influence departure decisions of yellow-rumped warblers from inland

Abstract = {{Hunger is a complex motivational state that drives multiple behaviors.
   The sensation of hunger is caused by an imbalance between energy intake
   and expenditure. One immediate response to hunger is increased food
   consumption. Hunger also modulates behaviors related to food seeking
   such as increased locomotion and enhanced sensory sensitivity in both
   insects {[}1-5] and vertebrates {[}6, 7]. In addition, hunger can
   promote the expression of food-associated memory {[}8, 9]. Although
   progress is being made {[}10], how hunger is represented in the brain
   and how it coordinates these behavioral responses is not fully
   understood in any system. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to
   identify neurons encoding hunger. We found a small group of neurons
   that, when activated, induced a fed fly to eat as though it were
   starved, suggesting that these neurons are downstream of the metabolic
   regulation of hunger. Artificially activating these neurons also
   promotes appetitive memory performance in sated flies, indicating that
   these neurons are not simply feeding command neurons but likely play a
   more general role in encoding hunger. We determined that the neurons
   relevant for the feeding effect are serotonergic and project broadly
   within the brain, suggesting a possible mechanism for how various
   responses to hunger are coordinated. These findings extend our
   understanding of the neural circuitry that drives feeding and enable
   future exploration of how state influences neural activity within this
   circuit.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid hormonal peptide that is intimately related
   to the regulation of food in take and body weight. Once secreted,
   ghrelin binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a, the only
   known receptor for ghrelin and is capable of activating a number of
   signaling cascades, ultimately resulting in an increase in food intake
   and adiposity. Because ghrelin has been linked to overeating and the
   development of obesity, a number of pharmacological interventions have
   been generated in order to interfere with either the activation of
   ghrelin or interrupting ghrelin signaling as a means to reducing
   appetite and decrease weight gain. Here, we present a novel peptide,
   CF801, capable of reducing circulating acylated ghrelin levels and
   subsequent body weight gain and adiposity. Tot his end, we show that IP
   administration of CF801 is sufficient to reduce circulating plasma
   acylated ghrelin levels. Acutely, intraperitoneal injections of CF801
   resulted in decreased rebound feeding after an overnight fast. When
   delivered chronically, they decreased weight gain and adiposity without
   affecting caloric intake. CF801, however, did cause a change in diet
   preference, decreasing preference for a high-fat diet and increasing
   preference for regular chow diet. Given the complexity of ghrelin
   receptor function, we propose that CF801, along with other compounds
   that regulate ghrelin secretion, may prove to be a beneficial tool in
   the study of the ghrelin system, and potential targets for ghrelin-based
   obesity treatments without altering the function of ghrelin receptors.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{63-72}},

Abstract = {{The field of personality psychology offers a wealth of robust empirical
   research and a successful descriptive taxonomy, but neither explains the
   origins of the structure of human personality nor elaborates a
   generative framework for predicting the specific conditions that evoke
   the development of distinct personality traits. Exploration of
   traditional personality constructs within an evolutionary adaptive
   individual differences framework may help fill this explanatory gap.
   Personality traits exhibit functional features and patterns of variation
   expected from psychological adaptations designed to solve survival- and
   reproduction-related challenges recurrently faced during our species'
   evolutionary history. Condition-dependent evolutionary models of
   personality have been proposed for decades, but only recently have begun
   to see empirical investigation. These models posit that species-typical
   psychological mechanisms take as input cues from the individual's
   phenotype that would have been ancestrally linked to differential
   cost-benefit tradeoffs of alternative personality strategies, and
   produce as output personality trait levels with the greatest
   probabilistic net benefit for the individual. This paper elaborates a
   more nuanced conceptual framework that builds on earlier
   conceptualizations of condition-dependent traits to yield new and
   untested hypotheses about personality trait variation and covariation.
   It then describes clear future research directions for empirically
   investigating these readily testable hypotheses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Body weight and the levels of stored body fat have fitness consequences.
   Greater levels of fat may provide protection against catastrophic
   failures in the food supply, but they may also increase the risk of
   predation. Animals may therefore regulate their fatness according to
   their perceived risks of predation and starvation: the starvation
   predation trade-off model. We tested the predictions of this model in
   wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) by experimentally manipulating predation
   risk and starvation risk. We predicted that under increased predation
   risk individuals would lose weight and under increased starvation risk
   they would gain it. We simulated increased predation risk by playing the
   calls made by predatory birds (owls: Tyto alba and Bubo bubo) to the
   mice. Control groups included exposure to calls of a non-predatory bird
   (blackbird: Turdus merula) or silence. Mice exposed to owl calls at
   night lost weight relative to the silence group, mediated via reduced
   food intake, but exposure to owl calls in the day had no significant
   effect. Exposure to blackbird calls at night also resulted in weight
   loss, but blackbird calls in the day had no effect. Mice seemed to have
   a generalised response to bird calls at night irrespective of their
   actual source. This could be because in the wild any bird calling at
   night will be a predation risk, and any bird calling in the day would
   not be, because at that time the mice would-normally be resting, and
   hence not exposed to avian predators. Consequently, mice have not
   evolved to distinguish different types of call but only to respond to
   the time of day that they occur. Mice exposed to stochastic 24 h
   starvation events altered their behaviour (reduced activity) during the
   refeeding days that followed the deprivation periods to regain the lost
   mass. However, they only marginally elevated their food intake and
   consequently had reduced body weight/fat storage compared to that of the
   control unstarved group. This response may have been constrained by
   physiological factors (alimentary tract absorption capacity) or
   behavioural factors (perceived risk of predation). Overall the responses
   of the mice appeared to provide limited support for the starvation
   predation trade-off model, and suggest that wood mice are much more
   sensitive to predation risk than they are to starvation risk. (C) 2015

Volume = {{158}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{ObjectivesCross-species comparisons show that high extrinsic mortality
   favors the evolution of faster life histories. There is interest in
   applying this principle to human life history plasticity, based on the
   idea that psychosocial stressors that correlate with extrinsic mortality
   accelerate reproductive pace. Most prior studies have been conducted in
   settings in which psychosocial stressors co-occur with the
   maturation-accelerating influence of nutritional abundance.
   Materials and MethodsWe evaluate cues of local mortality (sibling death)
   or low parental investment (paternal instability; maternal absence) and
   energetic measures during development as predictors of life history
   scheduling among males (n=754) in a Philippine population with marginal
   developmental nutritional.
   ResultsMales who had more favorable nutritional status during childhood,
   as reflected in linear growth, skinfold thickness, and caloric intake,
   were more maturationally advanced in adolescence (all P<0.05). Taller
   stature and higher caloric intake during childhood also predicted
   earlier ages at first sex (both P<0.01), which persisted after
   controlling for the effect of nutrition on pubertal maturation. While
   psychosocial stressors did not predict accelerated maturation, males who
   as children grew up with an unstable paternal presence had sex earlier
   (P<0.05) and tended to become fathers sooner than those with a stable
   fatherly presence. Those who had a sibling die became fathers sooner
   than those who did not (P<0.05).
   DiscussionOur findings point to important energetic constraints on the
   onset of reproductive maturity, while psychosocial stressors accelerate
   entry to parenthood, which may be comparatively more socially, rather
   than biologically, constrained. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:175-184, 2015.

Abstract = {{Findings showing that neonatal lesions of the forebrain dopaminergic
   system in rodents lead to juvenile locomotor hyperactivity and learning
   deficits have been taken as evidence of face validity for the attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the core cognitive and
   physiological intermediate phenotypes underlying this rodent syndrome
   remain unknown. Here we show that early postnatal dopaminergic lesions
   cause long-lasting deficits in exploitation of shelter, social and
   nutritional resources, and an imbalanced exploratory behavior, where
   nondirected local exploration is exacerbated, whereas sophisticated
   search behaviors involving sequences of goal directed actions are
   degraded. Importantly, some behavioral deficits do not diminish after
   adolescence but instead worsen or mutate, particularly those related to
   the exploration of wide and spatially complex environments. The in vivo
   electrophysiological recordings and morphological reconstructions of
   striatal medium spiny neurons reveal corticostriatal alterations
   associated to the behavioral phenotype. More specifically, an
   attenuation of corticostriatal functional connectivity, affecting medial
   prefrontal inputs more markedly than cingulate and motor inputs, is
   accompanied by a contraction of the dendritic arbor of striatal
   projection neurons in this animal model. Thus, dopaminergic neurons are
   essential during postnatal development for the functional and structural
   maturation of corticostriatal connections. From a bottom-up viewpoint,
   our findings suggest that neuropsychiatric conditions presumably linked
   to developmental alterations of the dopaminergic system should be
   evaluated for deficits in foraging decision making, alterations in the
   recruitment of corticostriatal circuits during foraging tasks, and
   structural disorganization of the frontostriatal connections.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic investigation of the personality of the interrogated is
   connected with the need which ensures the effectiveness of preparation
   and the achievement of purposes of the interrogation, but, at the same
   time, it involves a number of difficulties which appear in the process
   of its implementation. The data available to the psychological, forensic
   and a number of other human sciences allow to assert with confidence
   that a personality obeys certain laws and knowing these laws allows a
   person to get to know this personality forming a system out of this
   information. It is well known from biology and physiology that the
   existence of any living organism needs energy. Any energy is exhausted,
   being consumed and spent on the maintenance of a living organism. To
   compensate for the spent energy reserves it is necessary to consume.
   Consumption of energy for living organisms is associated with the
   consumption of organic substances which is known to all as the nutrition
   process. A human being is a living organism to whom the designated
   pattern is logically extended. Since birth a person acquires skills to
   survive in the environment since it is dictated by the need for
   survival. The mechanism that allows a person to balance the available
   opportunities and potential environmental factors is the mechanism of
   homeostasis. The manifestation of the mechanism of homeostasis in life
   of a human being is caused by a number of the following laws: firstly,
   the existence of a living organism without energy is impossible;
   secondly, the energy is spent on maintaining the existence of a living
   organism; thirdly, lack of energy leads to problems and health disorders
   and, subsequently, to the irreversible loss of the viability of a living
   organism; fourthly, replenishing energy requires exploration, production
   and consumption of resources which are capable of restoring this energy;
   fifthly, in the conditions of resources being finite, the passage of
   time and continuous flow of energy (consumption of energy is constant,
   the only question is the flow rate), it is required to optimize the
   process of exploration, production and consumption of resources which
   are the sources of energy needed for the existence of a living organism.
   From the moment of birth and in the further development process a person
   has a genetic predisposition to a certain set of a particular type of
   activity. In this regard it is clear that homeostasis is reflected in
   the life scenarios of the interrogated as the most familiar way of
   interacting with the environment and people in solving the problems of
   their existence, viability and survival by achieving integrity,
   stability and satisfaction of physiological and psychological needs.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behaviour of omnivores is often difficult to predict and,
   thus, our understanding of their role in ecosystems is limited. The
   majority of our knowledge about omnivores comes from studies examining
   their preferences for different species of plants and prey under
   different conditions. The potential effect of intraspecific variation in
   food quality on omnivore foraging behaviour has received less attention.
   To enhance our understanding of the foraging behaviour of omnivores, we
   used focal observations in the laboratory to monitor the foraging
   behaviour and activity budget of an omnivorous insect, Dicyphus hesperus
   Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae), in arenas where a single species of plant
   food and a single species of prey food were provided at varying levels
   of quality based on nitrogen content. The activity budget of D. hesperus
   was not balanced; it was dominated by prey feeding, followed by plant
   feeding and probing. Foraging behaviour of D. hesperus was affected by

Abstract = {{Differences in food availability and predation risk can influence how
   herbivores use landscapes. As a result, trade-offs between costs and
   benefits can influence habitat and patch selection. To determine how
   oribi antelope, Ourebia ourebi, weigh up costs and benefits when making
   habitat and patch level foraging decisions, we measured giving-up
   densities in artificial patches. First, we determined large-scale
   habitat use, and then explored how different variables explained patch
   use within habitats. When the availability of food within patches across
   the different habitats was equal, oribi preferred to feed in short and
   tall grasslands and avoided woodlands. Furthermore, the avoidance of
   woodlands extended into the surrounding grasslands, resulting in oribi
   feeding less intensively in grassland areas within 15 m of the
   woodlands. Within the safe grassland habitats, oribi preferred to feed
   in patches close to tall grass (i.e. escape cover), and where they could
   see beyond 2 m. These results suggest that oribi select habitats and
   patches in relation to perceived predation risk (i.e. predation costs
   outweigh potential food intake benefits). However, when we increased
   food availability within woodlands, oribi increased their large-scale
   risk-taking behaviour and fed in these woodlands. Furthermore, this
   increased risk taking extended to small-scale foraging decisions whereby
   an increase in food availability within woodlands caused oribi to
   increase their relative usage of patches that had sight lines as well as
   patches that were closer to potential ambush sites. Ultimately, these
   results highlight how changes in food availability can determine the
   degree to which herbivores are willing to increase their risk-taking
   behaviour, and how these changes can affect overall landscape use. (C)

   After adjustment for confounding, significant prepregnancy risk factors
   for preterm birth included maternal age a parts per thousand yen35 years

Abstract = {{Maternal depression is a known risk factor for poor outcomes for
   children. Pathways to these poor outcomes relate to reduced maternal
   responsiveness or sensitivity to the child. Impaired responsiveness
   potentially impacts the feeding relationship and thus may be a risk
   factor for inappropriate feeding practices. The aim of this study was to
   examine the longitudinal relationships between self-reported maternal
   post-natal depressive symptoms at child age 4 months and feeding
   practices at child age 2 years in a community sample. Participants were
   Australian first-time mothers allocated to the control group of the
   NOURISH randomized controlled trial when infants were 4 months old.
   Complete data from 211 mothers (of 346 allocated) followed up when their
   children were 2 years of age (51\% girls) were available for analysis.
   The relationship between Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
   score (child age 4 months) and child feeding practices (child age 2
   years) was tested using hierarchical linear regression analysis adjusted
   for maternal and child characteristics. Higher EPDS score was associated
   with less responsive feeding practices at child age 2 years: greater

   provides evidence for the proposed link between maternal post-natal
   depressive symptoms and lower responsiveness in child feeding. These
   findings suggest that the provision of support to mothers experiencing
   some levels of depressive symptomatology in the early post-natal period
   may improve responsiveness in the child feeding relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Background. In cross-sectional studies, cocaine users generally display
   elevated levels of self-reported and cognitive impulsivity. To what
   extent these impairments are stable upsilon. variable markers of cocaine
   use disorder, and, thus, are preexisting or drug-induced, has not yet
   been systematically investigated.
   Method. We conducted a longitudinal study with cocaine users who changed
   or maintained their consumption intensity, measuring self-reported
   impulsivity with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and cognitive
   impulsivity with the Rapid Visual Processing task (RVP), Iowa Gambling
   task (IGT), and Delay Discounting task (DD) at baseline and at 1-year
   follow-up. We assessed 48 psychostimulant-naive controls and 19 cocaine
   users with decreased, 19 users with increased, and 19 users with
   unchanged cocaine intake after 1 year as confirmed by hair analysis.
   Results. Results of linear multilevel modelling showed significant group
   x time interactions for the BIS-11 total score and the IGT total card
   ratio. Increasers showed a trend for elevated scores, whereas decreasers
   exhibited reduced self-reported impulsivity scores within 1 year.
   Surprisingly, increasers' IGT performance was improved after 1 year,
   whereas decreasers' performance deteriorated. By contrast, neither RVP
   response bias B{''} nor DD total score showed substantial group x time
   interactions. Importantly, BIS-11 and DD revealed strong test-retest
   reliabilities.
   Conclusion. Self-reported impulsivity (BIS-11) and decision-making
   impulsivity (IGT) covary with changing cocaine use, whereas response
   bias and delay discounting remain largely unaffected. Thus,
   self-reported impulsivity and gambling decision-making were strongly
   state-dependent in a stimulant-using population and may be suitable to
   monitor treatment success, whereas delay of gratification was confirmed
   as a potential endophenotype of stimulant addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the influence of diet on larval
   proactive-reactive behavioural dimension of stress coping style
   responses. The present study evaluated the influence of using different
   vegetables oils (Linseed; Soybean; Olive) and fish oil (Cod liver) for
   Artemia metanauplii nutritional enrichment on the proactive-reactive
   behavioural responses of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis)
   post-larvae (40 days post hatch). Forty-two Senegalese sole larvae from
   each of the four replicate tanks per treatment were tested. Two tests
   were performed: a new environment individual-based test, which evaluate
   the larvae latency time to move, total activity time and total distance
   moved; and a risk group-based test, which consisted in evaluating the
   larval capacity to cross from a ``comfort{''} zone to a ``risk{''} zone.
   In the group-based test, proactive, intermediate and reactive
   individuals were identified depending on the time taken to cross between
   two zones. Larvae fed with Artemia metanauplii enriched with the cod
   liver oil emulsion were significantly (P=0.01) larger and in the
   individual-based test presented significantly higher total activity time
   (P=0.08) and total distance moved (P=0.01) than larvae from the other
   dietary treatments. No significant correlations (P>0.05) were observed
   between larvae total length and latency time to move, total activity
   time or total distance moved across all treatments or within any dietary
   treatment. In the group-based test, fish fed with Artemia enriched with
   the cod liver oil emulsion presented a significantly higher proportion
   of proactive larvae (P=0.02) and the lower proportion of reactive
   larvae. The present study showed for the first time that (i) Senegalese
   sole presented a defined proactive-reactive behaviour from early
   ontogenesis and (ii) dietary fatty acid composition significantly
   influenced the proactive-reactive behavioural dimension of stress coping
   style of sole larvae. The current study has practical implications that
   open the possibility to produce organisms that have behavioural styles
   that could ultimately result in improved aquaculture productivity. (C)

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{How trophic resources are managed is a key factor in our understanding
   of the success of invasive species. In amphibians that usually occupy
   ephemeral ponds, the capacity to acquire resources and food selection
   are especially important because as a pond dries, the larval density
   increases and food resources are limited. Abundant and high-quality food
   can increase the final size and reduce the duration of development of
   amphibians. The aim of this work was to assess the trophic traits of
   tadpoles of the invasive (originally North African) anuran Discoglossus
   pictus compared to those of native European Epidalea calamita tadpoles
   under laboratory conditions. Food of two different levels of quality was
   supplied, and the feeding activity and food preference of the two
   species were analysed alone and in co-occurrence. D. pictus was capable
   of modifying its behaviour and food preferences; while E. calamita
   displayed much milder differences between treatments. Both alone and in
   co-occurrence with the native species, the invasive tadpoles obtained
   higher feeding activity values and showed a stronger preference for
   high-quality food. Additionally, when high densities of the two species
   shared food resources, the feeding activity results indicated potential
   displacement of the native tadpoles to low-quality resources. D. pictus
   thus presents trophic traits that are favourable for invasion and could
   limit the fitness of E. calamita when resources are limited or there is
   a risk of pond desiccation.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of growth to nutritional status is an important adaptive
   response of living organisms to their environment. For this ability,
   animals have evolved various strategies, including endocrine systems
   that respond to changing nutritional conditions. In animals, nutritional
   information is mostly perceived by peripheral organs, such as the
   digestive tract and adipose tissues, and is subsequently transmitted to
   other peripheral organs or the brain, which integrates the incoming
   signals and orchestrates physiological and behavioral responses. In
   Drosophila melanogaster, adipose tissue, known as the fat body,
   functions as an endocrine organ that communicates with the brain. This
   fat body-brain axis coordinates growth with nutritional status by
   regulating the secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps)
   from the brain. However, the molecular nature of the fat body-brain axis
   remains to be elucidated. We recently demonstrated that a small peptide,
   CCHamide-2 (CCHa2), expressed in the fat body and gut, directly
   stimulates its receptor (CCHa2-R) in the brain, leading to Dilp
   production. Notably, the expression of CCHa2 is sensitive to the
   presence of nutrients, particularly sugars. Our results, together with
   the results of previous studies, show that signaling between peripheral
   organs and the brain is a conserved strategy that couples nutritional
   availability to organismal physiology.}},

Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infancy is a period of rapid growth and habit formation and
   hence could be a critical period for obesity prevention. Excess weight
   gain during infancy is associated with later obesity and formula-fed
   babies are more likely to gain excess weight compared to breastfed
   babies. The primary trial outcome is a change in the weight standard
   deviation score from birth to 1 year.
   Methods/Design: We will recruit 650 to 700 parents who introduce
   formula-milk feeds within 14 weeks of their baby's birth to a single
   (assessor) blind, parallel group, individually randomised controlled
   trial. The focus of the intervention is the caregiver (usually the
   mother), and the focus of the primary outcome is the infant. The
   intervention group will receive the behavioural intervention, which aims
   to reduce formula-milk intake, promote responsive feeding and healthy
   weaning, and prevent excessive weight gain during infancy. The
   intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and action planning
   ('implementation intentions'). It consists of three components: (1) a
   motivational component to strengthen parents' motivation to follow the
   Baby Milk feeding guidelines, (2) an action planning component to help
   translate motivation into action, and (3) a coping planning component to
   help parents deal with difficult situations. It will be delivered by
   trained facilitators (research nurses) over 6 months through three
   face-to-face contacts, two telephone contacts and written materials. The
   control group will have the same number of contacts with facilitators,
   and general issues about feeding will be discussed. Anthropometric
   outcomes will be measured by trained research staff, blind to group
   allocation, at baseline, 6 months and 12 months following standard
   operating procedures. Validated questionnaires will assess milk intake,
   temperament, appetite, sleep, maternal quality of life and maternal
   psychological factors. A 4-day food diary will be completed at 8 months.
   Discussion: The results of the trial will help to inform infant feeding
   guidelines and to understand the links between infant feeding,
   behaviour, appetite and growth.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that obesity is linked to prominent alterations
   in learning and decision-making. This general difference may also
   underlie the preference for immediately consumable, highly palatable but
   unhealthy and high calorie foods. Such poor food-related inter-temporal
   decision-making can explain weight gain; however, it is not yet clear
   whether this deficit can be generalized to other domains of
   inter-temporal decision-making, for example financial decisions.
   Further, little is known about the stability of decision making behavior
   in obesity, especially in the presence of rewarding cues. To answer
   these questions, obese and lean participants (n = 52) completed two
   sessions of a novel priming paradigm including a computerized monetary
   delay discounting task. In the first session, general differences
   between groups in financial delay discounting were measured. In the
   second session, we tested the general stability of discount rates.
   Additionally, participants were primed by affective visual cues of
   different contextual categories before making financial decisions. We
   found that the obese group showed stronger discounting of future
   monetary rewards than the lean group, but groups did not differ in their
   general stability between sessions nor in their sensitivity toward
   changes in reward magnitude. In the obese group, a fast decrease of
   subjective value over time was directly related to a higher tendency for
   opportunistic eating. Obese in contrast to lean people were primed by
   the affective cues, showing a sex specific pattern of priming direction.
   Our findings demonstrate that environments rich of cues, aiming at
   inducing unhealthy consumer decisions, can be highly detrimental for
   obese people. It also underscores that obesity is not merely a medical
   condition but has a strong cognitive component, meaning that current
   dietary and medical treatment strategies may fall too short.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative behaviour may allow animals to cope with changes in their

   suggests that individuals are commonly driven to innovate by necessity;
   for instance by hunger or because they are physically unable to
   outcompete others for access to resources. However, it is not known
   whether the factors that drive individuals to innovate are stable across
   contexts. We examined contextual variation in the drivers of innovation
   in rock pool prawns (Palaemon spp), invertebrates that face widely
   fluctuating environments and may, through the actions of tides and
   waves, find themselves isolated or in groups. Using two novel foraging
   tasks, we examined the effects of body size and hunger in prawns tested
   in solitary and group contexts. When tested alone, small prawns were
   significantly more likely to succeed in a spatial task, and faster to
   reach the food in a manipulation task, while hunger state had no effect.
   In contrast, size had no effect when prawns were tested in groups, but
   food-deprived individuals were disproportionately likely to innovate in
   both tasks. We suggest that contextual variation in the drivers of
   innovation is likely to be common in animals living in variable
   environments, and may best be understood by considering variation in the
   perception of relative risks and rewards under different conditions.}},

   (upland) forest habitats and characterized subsequent fine-scale
   movements and stopover duration using radiotelemetry. Minimum stopover
   duration averaged 4.1 days and was 1.5 days longer in
   bottomland-released birds than in upland-released birds. Minimum
   stopover duration decreased by 1.4 days per week over the spring
   migratory period. For upland-released and bottomland-released birds,
   respectively, maximum distance moved from the release point was 635 +/-
   58 m and 326 +/- 51 m on the day of the release and 773 +/- 109 m and
   504 +/- 83 m on the following day. Upland-released individuals traveled
   nearly twice as far from the release point on day 1 as
   bottomland-released birds. Upon reaching bottomland habitats within 2.0
   +/- 0.3 h of release, subsequent distance moved on day 1 by
   upland-released birds was similar to that of bottomland-released birds.
   Cumulatively, these results indicate that initial exploratory movements
   were facultative and habitat dependent and that waterthrushes can
   successfully locate suitable stopover habitats in a heterogeneous
   landscape at the spatial scales we investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The predicted increase of the frequency and intensity of wildfires as a
   result of climate change could have a devastating impact on many species
   and ecosystems. However, the particular physiological and behavioural
   adaptions of animals to survive fires are poorly understood. We aimed to
   provide the first quantitative data on physiological and behavioural
   mechanisms used by a small heterothermic marsupial mammal, the
   fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), that may be crucial for
   survival during and immediately after a fire. Specifically, we aimed to
   determine (i) whether captive torpid animals are able to respond to fire
   stimuli and (ii) which energy saving mechanisms are used in response to
   fires. The initial response of torpid dunnarts to smoke exposure was to
   arouse immediately and therefore express shorter and shallower torpor
   bouts. Dunnarts also increased activity after smoke exposure when food
   was provided, but not when food was withheld. A charcoal/ash substrate,
   imitating post-fire conditions, resulted in a decrease in torpor use and
   activity, but only when food was available. Our novel data suggests that
   heterothermic mammals are able to respond to fire stimuli, such as
   smoke, to arouse from torpor as an initial response to fire and adjust
   torpor use and activity levels according to food availability modulated
   by fire cues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{123-132}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animals can insure themselves against the risk of starvation associated
   with unpredictable food availability by storing energy reserves or
   gathering information about alternative food sources. The former
   strategy carries costs in terms of mass-dependent predation risk, while
   the latter trades off against foraging for food; both trade-offs may be
   influenced by an individual's developmental history. Here, we consider a
   possible role of early developmental experience in inducing different
   mass regulation and foraging strategies in European starlings. We
   measured the body mass, body condition, foraging effort, food
   consumption and contrafreeloading (foraging for food hidden in sand when
   equivalent food is freely available) of adult birds (>= 10 months old)
   that had previously undergone a subtle early life manipulation of food
   competition (cross-fostering into the highest or lowest ranks in the
   brood size hierarchy when 2 - 12 days of age). We found that
   developmentally disadvantaged birds were fatter in adulthood and
   differed in foraging behaviour compared with their advantaged siblings.
   Disadvantaged birds were hyperphagic compared with advantaged birds, but
   only following a period of food deprivation, and also spent more time
   contrafreeloading. Advantaged birds experienced a trade-off between
   foraging success and time spent contrafreeloading, whereas disadvantaged
   birds faced no such trade-off, owing to their greater foraging
   efficiency. Thus, developmentally disadvantaged birds appeared to retain
   a phenotypic memory of increased nestling food competition, employing
   both energy storage and information gathering insurance strategies to a
   greater extent than their advantaged siblings. Our results suggest that
   subtle early life disadvantage in the form of psychosocial stress and/or
   food insecurity can leave a lasting legacy on foraging behaviour and
   mass regulation even in the absence of food insufficiency during
   development or adulthood. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{ObjectiveEvidence associates anorexia nervosa (AN) with epigenetic
   alterations that could contribute to illness risk or entrenchment. We
   investigated the extent to which AN is associated with a distinct
   methylation profile compared to that seen in normal-eater women.
   MethodGenome-wide methylation profiles, obtained using DNA from whole
   blood, were determined in 29 women currently ill with AN (10 with
   AN-restrictive type, 19 with AN-binge/purge type) and 15 normal-weight,
   normal-eater control women, using 450 K Illumina bead arrays.
   ResultsRegardless of type, AN patients showed higher and less-variable
   global methylation patterns than controls. False Discovery Rate
   corrected comparisons identified 14 probes that were hypermethylated in
   women with AN relative to levels obtained in normal-eater controls,
   representing genes thought to be associated with histone acetylation,
   RNA modification, cholesterol storage and lipid transport, and dopamine
   and glutamate signaling. Age of onset was significantly associated with
   differential methylation in gene pathways involved in development of the
   brain and spinal cord, while chronicity of illness was significantly
   linked to differential methylation in pathways involved with
   synaptogenesis, neurocognitive deficits, anxiety, altered social
   functioning, and bowel, kidney, liver and immune function.
   DiscussionAlthough pre-existing differences cannot be ruled out, our
   findings are consistent with the idea of secondary alterations in
   methylation at genomic regions pertaining to social-emotional
   impairments and physical sequelae that are commonly seen in AN patients.
   Further investigation is needed to establish the clinical relevance of
   the affected genes in AN, and, importantly, reversibility of effects

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring environmental factors shape developmental
   trajectories to produce variable phenotypes. Such developmental
   phenotypic plasticity can have important effects on fitness, and has
   been demonstrated for numerous behavioral and morphological traits.
   However, surprisingly few studies have examined developmental plasticity
   of the nervous system in response to naturally occurring environmental
   variation, despite accumulating evidence for neuroplasticity in a
   variety of organisms. Here, we asked whether the brain is
   developmentally plastic by exposing larval amphibians to natural and
   anthropogenic factors. Leopard frog tadpoles were exposed to predator
   cues, reduced food availability, or sublethal concentrations of the
   pesticide chlorpyrifos in semi-natural enclosures. Mass, growth,
   survival, activity, larval period, external morphology, brain mass, and
   brain morphology were measured in tadpoles and after metamorphosis.
   Tadpoles in the experimental treatments had lower masses than controls,
   although developmental rates and survival were similar. Tadpoles exposed
   to predator cues or a high dose of chlorpyrifos had altered body shapes
   compared to controls. In addition, brains from tadpoles exposed to
   predator cues or a low dose of chlorpyrifos were narrower and shorter in
   several dimensions compared to control tadpoles and tadpoles with low
   food availability. Interestingly, the changes in brain morphology
   present at the tadpole stage did not persist in the metamorphs. Our
   results show that brain morphology is a developmentally plastic trait
   that is responsive to ecologically relevant natural and anthropogenic
   factors. Whether these effects on brain morphology are linked to
   performance or fitness is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Zooplankton inhabiting deep, oligotrophic, tropical lakes must cope with
   scenarios where the combination of resource limitation, high
   visual-predation risk, UV-induced damage and seasonal development of
   anoxic waters, entail particular challenges for organisms, uncommon in
   temperate environments. We assessed the diel vertical
   migrationDVM(UV/predation-avoidance strategy), numerical response, and
   starvation resistance (physiological strategies to cope with food
   scarcity) of the copepod Leptodiaptomus garciai and the rotifers
   Hexarthra jenkinae and Brachionus sp. Mexico, which constitute the
   zooplankton assemblage of Alchichica, a high-altitude, deep,
   oligotrophic, hyposaline, warm-monomictic lake located in Mexico. L.
   garciai followed the normal pattern of DVM in all seasons; with
   organisms concentrated approximate to 20 m deeper than the depth of 1\%
   photosynthetically active radiation at mid-day, with evasion from the
   planktivore Poblana alchichica as the most probable driver. However,
   copepods could not evade the euphotic zone owing to the anoxic
   conditions of the hypolimnion during the well-established stratification
   period. Rotifers did not migrate vertically. The dominance of copepods
   throughout the year can be explained by their low food threshold, high
   proportion of usable reserves and the lowest rate of mass loss at food
   deprivation. Contrastingly, rotifers are scarce and intermittent due to
   frequent resource limitation and because they lose mass at higher rates.
   However, they are able to suddenly increase due to their high growth
   rates. We demonstrated that the interaction between environmental
   constraints and the specific combinations of traits can explain
   zooplankton structure in the lake. This study enlightens the necessity
   to improve current limnological models with data from tropical lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The mere presence of predators (i.e., predation risk) can alter consumer
   physiology by restricting food intake and inducing stress, which can
   ultimately affect prey-mediated ecosystem processes such as nutrient
   cycling. However, many environmental factors, including conspecific
   density, can mediate the perception of risk by prey. Prey conspecific
   density has been defined as a fundamental feature that modulates
   perceived risk. In this study, we tested the effects of predation risk
   on prey nutrient stoichiometry (body and excretion). Using a constant
   predation risk, we also tested the effects of varying conspecific
   densities on prey responses to predation risk. To answer these
   questions, we conducted a mesocosm experiment using caged predators
   (Belostoma sp.), and small bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus)
   as prey. We found that L.catesbeianus tadpoles adjust their body
   nutrient stoichiometry in response to predation risk, which is affected
   by conspecific density. We also found that the prey exhibited strong
   morphological responses to predation risk (i.e., an increase in tail
   muscle mass), which were positively correlated to body nitrogen content.
   Thus, we pose the notion that in risky situations, adaptive phenotypic
   responses rather than behavioral ones might partially explain why prey
   might have a higher nitrogen content under predation risk. In addition,
   the interactive roles of conspecific density and predation risk, which
   might result in reduced perceived risk and physiological restrictions in
   prey, also affected how prey stoichiometry responded to the fear of
   predation.}},

Abstract = {{Survival through periods of resource scarcity depends on the balance
   between metabolic demands and energy storage. The opposing effects of
   predation and starvation mortality are predicted to result in trade-offs
   between traits that optimize fitness during periods of resource plenty
   (e.g., during the growing season) and those that optimize fitness during
   periods of resource scarcity (e.g., during the winter). We conducted a
   common environment experiment with two genetically distinct strains of
   rainbow trout to investigate trade-offs due to (1) the balance of growth
   and predation risk related to foraging rate during the growing season
   and (2) the allocation of energy to body size prior to the winter. Fry
   (age 0) from both strains were stocked into replicate natural lakes at
   low and high elevation that differed in winter duration (i.e., ice
   cover) by 59 days. Overwinter survival was lowest in the high-elevation
   lakes for both strains. Activity rate and growth rate were highest at
   high elevation, but growing season survival did not differ between
   strains or between environments. Hence, we did not observe a trade-off
   between growth and predation risk related to foraging rate. Growth rate
   also differed significantly between the strains across both
   environments, which suggests that growth rate is involved in local
   adaptation. There was not, however, a difference between strains or
   between environments in energy storage. Hence, we did not observe a
   trade-off between growth and storage. Our findings suggest that
   intrinsic metabolic rate, which affects a trade-off between growth rate
   and overwinter survival, may influence local adaptation in organisms
   that experience particularly harsh winter conditions (e.g., extended
   periods trapped beneath the ice in high-elevation lakes) in some parts

Abstract = {{Background: Approximately 10\% of U.S. infants and toddlers are
   considered overweight. Hispanic infants persistently show higher
   prevalence rates for being overweight compared to other infants. Little
   is known about factors promoting excessive infant weight gain in
   Latinos.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe multidimensional factors
   and maternal feeding practices that may correlate with infant
   overfeeding in Latina mothers.
   Methods: Participants were 62 low-income immigrant Latina mothers and
   their infants. Study measures were: acculturation; maternal feeding
   beliefs and practices; food availability; temperament; 24-hour dietary
   recall; and infant's weight-for-height z score.
   Results: In regression models adjusted for infant's age, healthier
   feeding practices were significantly predicted by maternal education and
   infant's age. Most mothers preferred feeding their infants either
   formula or a combination of breast milk and formula. A significant
   proportion of the infants were overweight or obese and yet some mothers
   displayed difficulty recognizing this problem.
   Conclusion: Future intervention efforts should focus primarily on the
   promotion of healthy feeding practices that discourage overfeeding and
   support exclusive breastfeeding among this ethnic group. (C) 2015

   significant differences (P <= 0.05) of animal welfare under different

Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is an important medical problem affecting humans and animals in
   the developed world, but the evolutionary origins of the behaviours that
   cause obesity are poorly understood. The potential role of occasional
   gluts of food in determining fat-storage strategies for avoiding
   mortality have been overlooked, even though animals experienced such
   conditions in the recent evolutionary past and may follow the same
   strategies in the modern environment. Humans, domestic, and captive
   animals in the developed world are exposed to a surplus of calorie-rich
   food, conditions characterised as `constant-glut'. Here, we use a
   mathematical model to demonstrate that obesity-related mortality from
   poor health in a constant-glut environment should equal the average
   mortality rate in the `pre-modern' environment when predation risk was
   more closely linked with foraging. It should therefore not be surprising
   that animals exposed to abundant food often over-eat to the point of
   ill-health. Our work suggests that individuals tend to defend a given
   excessive level of reserves because this level was adaptive when gluts
   were short-lived. The model predicts that mortality rate in
   constant-glut conditions can increase as the assumed health cost of
   being overweight decreases, meaning that any adaptation that reduced
   such health costs would have counter-intuitively led to an increase in
   mortality in the modern environment. Taken together, these results imply
   that efforts to reduce the incidence of obesity that are focussed on
   altering individual behaviour are likely to be ineffective because
   modern, constant-glut conditions trigger previously adaptive behavioural
   responses.}},

Title = {{Individual honey bee (Apis cerana) foragers adjust their fuel load to
   match variability in forage reward}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Animals may adjust their behavior according to their perception of risk.
   Here we show that free-flying honey bee (Apis cerana) foragers mitigate
   the risk of starvation in the field when foraging on a food source that
   offers variable rewards by carrying more `fuel' food on their outward
   journey. We trained foragers to a feeder located 1.2 km from each of
   four colonies. On average foragers carried 12.7\% greater volume of
   fuel, equivalent to 30.2\% more glucose when foraging on a variable
   source (a random sequence of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 M sucrose solution,
   average sucrose content 1.5 M) than when forging on a consistent source
   (constant 1.5 M sucrose solution). Our findings complement an earlier
   study that showed that foragers decrease their fuel load as they become
   more familiar with a foraging place. We suggest that honey bee foragers
   are risk sensitive, and carry more fuel to minimize the risk of
   starvation in the field when a foraging trip is perceived as being
   risky, either because the forager is unfamiliar with the foraging site,
   or because the forage available at a familiar site offers variable
   rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Many echinoderm larvae exhibit phenotypic plasticity: a change in
   phenotype in response to environmental food levels. We investigated
   phenotypic plasticity in the larvae of the crown-of-thorns seastar
   Acanthaster planci, an opportunistic boom-and-bust species with larvae
   that have a strong response to food conditions. The increased predation
   pressure resulting from outbreaks (population explosions) of A. planci
   is deleterious to coral reefs, but the link between population outbreaks
   and larval ecology is poorly understood. We hypothesised that the larvae
   of A. planci would have a different morphological profile in the
   oligotrophic conditions typical of tropical waters than in the eutrophic
   conditions associated with increased nutrients. We predicted that larvae
   reared in low food conditions would increase their ciliated band length
   to enhance feeding potential. Larvae were fed algal concentrations
   representing starvation (0 cells ml(-1)), low food (oligo trophic; 1000
   cells ml(-1)), high food (eutrophic; 10 000 cells ml(-1)) or excessive
   food (100 000 cells ml(-1)) conditions. A phenotypic response was
   evident. Larvae in the 2 high food treatments had a shorter ciliated
   band length relative to body size. Conversely, larvae in the starvation
   and low food treatments had longer ciliated bands relative to body size,
   a change that would enhance particle capture capacity and facilitate
   larval success. This plastic response of the larvae of A. planci could
   have flow-on effects to adult populations, potentially facilitating
   population outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding space use remains a major challenge for animal ecology,
   with implications for species interactions, disease spread, and
   conservation. Behavioural type (BT) may shape the space use of
   individuals within animal populations. Bolder or more aggressive
   individuals tend to be more exploratory and disperse further. Yet, to
   date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal
   depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent
   space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern
   Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS)
   tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays,
   and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge
   resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that
   lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the
   neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other
   conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially
   aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to
   ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of
   these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when
   food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For
   example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the
   season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these
   predictors. These findings highlight a commonly overlooked source of
   heterogeneity in animal space use and improve our mechanistic
   understanding of processes leading to behaviourally driven disease
   dynamics and social structure.}},

Abstract = {{Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is an important risk factor for

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to evaluate, in a representative sample of high
   school students, the psychometric characteristics of the Italian version
   of the CEBRACS scale (Rahal et al., 2011), a questionnaire investigating
   compensatory eating behaviors correlated with alcohol consumption. These
   behaviors are adopted to make up for calories consumed through the
   drinking of alcohol and/or to enhance the intoxicative effects of
   alcohol. Study participants were selected from an initial sample of 965
   students. Out of the 965 youths originally recruited, 640 (376 males and
   264 females) reported drinking alcohol over the previous 3 months, and
   were considered eligible for the purpose of the study. The following
   questionnaires were administered: CEBRACS, Alcohol Use Disorders
   Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders, 1993), and the Eating Disorder
   Inventory-3 (EDI-3) (Garner, 2004). Test/retest reproducibility was
   evaluated on a subgroup of 189 youths. The factorial structure, internal
   consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of CEBRACS
   were evaluated. Factor analysis of inter-item correlation indicated 5
   factors as being better suited to describe data, with an estimated
   68.85\% variance: ``Alcohol Effect, ``Laxative Use{''}, ``Dietary
   Restraint and Exercise{''}, ``Diuretic Use{''}, ``Restriction and
   Vomiting{''}. A high degree of reproducibility and homogeneity (ICC =
   0.806; Cronbach's Alpha = 0.886) of the scale was detected. A
   significant correlation was revealed between CEBRACS, the three eating
   disorder risk scales comprised in EDI-3 and scores and clinical risk
   yielded by AUDIT. The overall reliability and validity of the CEBRACS
   scale was confirmed in an extensive sample of Italian students,
   highlighting a satisfactory construct validity, good internal
   consistency and good degree of reproducibility. In view of the relevance
   of the problem, associated with serious health risks, a more widespread
   investigation of the phenomenon should be conducted using evaluation

Abstract = {{Introduction: Although dietary habits can affect colorectal cancer (CRC)
   survivors' health, it is unclear how familiar survivors are with dietary
   guidelines, what they believe about healthy eating and alcohol
   consumption, and what hinders healthy dietary habits after cancer. This
   study assessed CRC survivors' familiarity with dietary guidelines, their
   eating and drinking habits, and perceived facilitators and barriers to
   healthy eating after cancer, including social support and self-efficacy
   for maintaining a healthy diet and limiting alcohol.
   Methods: A total of 593 individuals (50\% female; mean age, 74 years)
   diagnosed with CRC approximately 6 years prior to study entry in early
   2010 were identified through California Cancer Registry records and
   participated in a cross-sectional mailed survey assessing health
   behavior after cancer (46\% adjusted response rate). Analyses were
   conducted in 2014-2015.
   Results: Survivors were most familiar with and most likely to
   follow-recommendations to choose low-fat foods; 15\% had never heard of
   recommendations to limit alcohol. Survivors were more aware of
   recommendations involving messages to limit/avoid versus approach/choose
   certain foods. The most common barrier to a healthy diet involved the
   effort required (26\%). Survivors received more family/friend support
   and provider recommendations for healthy eating than limiting alcohol.
   Conclusions: Results provide an overview of awareness of and adherence
   to dietary recommendations among CRC survivors, highlighting the need
   for increasing awareness of recommendations that are especially relevant
   for survivors. Suggestions are made for modifying diet-related messages
   to facilitate comprehension and recall among CRC survivors, and
   increasing awareness among groups with the lowest awareness levels.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Group-foraging animals can coordinate their activities by performing
   positive signals that increase foraging or inhibitory signals that
   decrease recruitment when foragers detect danger. However, it is unclear
   whether foragers tune their excitatory and inhibitory signalling
   according to food value and predation risk. We therefore studied the
   signals that honeybee foragers perform before and after being attacked
   by live predators (wasps and spiders) or a robo-predator at a nectar
   source. Predator attacks significantly reduced recruitment dancing and
   increased stop signalling, which inhibits dancing for the dangerous
   resource. Attack equally reduced dancing for all sucrose concentrations.
   However, foragers factored travel costs into their positive signalling.
   At the feeder with greater travel cost (100 m), bees danced less when
   they responded more severely to attacks. At the low travel cost feeder
   (1 m), there was no significant effect of attack response severity upon
   dancing. Attacks increased inhibitory signal production. Live and
   robo-predator attacks elicited 131-fold more stop signals from foragers
   as compared to control treatments of freshly dead predators that did not
   attack. However, food profitability, distance and sucrose concentration
   did not alter stop signalling. We suggest that this pattern may
   generally characterize excitatory/inhibitory signal pairs in group
   foraging. Foragers tune positive signalling (recruitment) to food
   quality and peril, and this is countered by an inhibitory signal that is
   tuned to danger but not resource value. (C) 2015 The Association for the

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{113-119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Precopulatory sexual cannibalism is an extreme form of sexual conflict
   because it has the potential to eliminate current and future
   reproductive success for males. Several female factors such as body
   condition, mating status and orientation are predicted to impact the
   likelihood of cannibalism, and males are expected to respond to these
   factors by altering their approach behaviours in ways that minimize the
   chance of being attacked (i.e. slower approach and greater distance at
   mounting). We used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid
   Pseudomantis albofimbriata to test whether and how certain female risk
   factors affect male approach and mating behaviour. We created three
   different risk treatments by manipulating female body condition, mating
   status and orientation, and recorded the frequency of cannibalism, male
   mating success, male approach behaviours and copulation duration. As
   predicted, female body condition and mating status had an effect on the
   frequency of sexual cannibalism, and cannibalized males had
   significantly lower mating success than noncannibalized males. Female
   orientation was the least important factor in determining the rate of
   sexual cannibalism in this system, with no significant difference
   between front-and rear-facing females. Contrary to what we predicted,
   male P. albofimbriata did not alter/shape their approach or mating
   behaviours relative to any of the proposed female risk factors of sexual
   cannibalism. There was also no difference in copulation duration between
   cannibalized and noncannibalized males. Future studies that investigate
   the effect of sexual cannibalism on postcopulatory male mating
   strategies will provide better clarification of the costs and benefits
   of sexual cannibalism in this system and will also be useful in
   understanding why males do not respond to the risk of sexual cannibalism

Abstract = {{The deleterious effect of competition for space and food in animals
   increases with increasing population density. In contrast, familiarity
   towards conspecifics can relax the intensity of interference
   competition. Here, we hypothesized that familiarity towards conspecifics
   mitigates the effect of density-dependent growth and dispersal behaviour
   in territorial animals. To test this, wild-captured juvenile brown trout
   were subjected to two consecutive laboratory experiments. First, growth
   and fin erosion were measured for 40 d in a 2 x 2 factorial design
   manipulating density and familiarity. The density was manipulated via
   size of experimental tanks, while per capita food abundance and fish
   number was constant. All fish were subsequently exposed to an emergence
   test, giving them the option to leave their group and disperse to a
   novel unoccupied environment. The results show that familiarity
   increases growth and decreases the level of fin erosion (i.e. proxy of
   intensity of aggressive interactions). We found no significant effect of
   population density on growth rate. However, there was a tendency towards
   higher fin erosion in fish kept under high density. The growth of
   individuals was also affected by their size rank within the group, with
   the largest individuals in each group growing disproportionally faster
   than the rest of the group, probably due to their high social rank.
   However, the second and third fish in the size rank did not grow
   significantly faster and tended to suffer higher mortality than the rest
   of the group. During the emergence test, the largest individuals in the
   familiar groups left the shelter either as the first (six of 12 groups)
   or last (five of 12 groups) individual in the group, while no such
   pattern was observed in unfamiliar groups. Our results suggest that
   individuals in familiar groups receive less aggression and stress (i.e.
   fin damage) and grow faster than fish in unfamiliar groups. The
   mechanisms indicated in this laboratory study may be especially
   important in highly fecund organisms like fish which undergo
   density-dependent bottlenecks during early life.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Like many animals, firebugs (Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae) rely on
   behavioural adaptations to successfully endow their offspring with
   microbial mutualists. To transmit the nutritionally beneficial
   Coriobacteriaceae symbionts, female firebugs smear egg surfaces with
   symbiont-containing faecal droplets that are subsequently ingested by
   newly hatched nymphs through active probing to initiate infection.
   Alternatively, the symbionts can be acquired horizontally through
   contact with faeces of infected conspecifics. Here, we report that these
   adaptations ensuring successful transmission of bacterial symbionts
   among firebugs are exploited by the specialized trypanosomatid parasite
   Leptomonas pyrrhocoris. Using comparative transcriptomics, fluorescence
   in situ hybridization (FISH) and controlled bioassays, we demonstrate
   that the transmission cycle of L. pyrrhocoris mirrors that of the
   bacterial mutualists, with high efficiency for both vertical and
   horizontal transmission. This indicates that the parasite capitalizes on
   pre-existing behavioural adaptations (egg smearing and probing) to
   facilitate its own transfer within host populations, adaptations that
   likely evolved to initiate and maintain an association with beneficial
   gut symbionts. Thus, the transmission of mutualistic microbes across
   host generations can entail a significant risk of co-transmitting
   pathogens or parasites, thereby exerting selective pressures on the host
   to evolve more specific mechanisms of transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Omnivorous arthropods make dietary choices according to the environment
   in which they forage, mainly availability/quality of plant and/or prey
   resources. Such decisions and their subsequent impacts on life-history

   feeding behavior observation as well as glasshouse cages for plant
   preference assessment, we studied effects of the presence of prey
   (Lepidoptera eggs) and nitrogen/water availability to host tomato plants
   on the foraging behavior and life-history traits in the omnivorous
   predator Macrolophus pygmaeus (Heteroptera: Miridae). In the absence of
   prey, the predator fed equally on the plants treated with various levels
   of nitrogen and water. In the presence of prey, however, the feeding
   rate on plants decreased when the plant received low water input. The
   feeding rate on prey was positively correlated with feeding rate on
   plants; that is, prey feeding increased with plant feeding when the
   plants received high water input. Moreover, plants receiving high water
   input attracted more M.pygmaeus adults compared with those receiving low
   water input. For M.pygmaeus fitness, the presence of prey enhanced its
   fertility and longevity, but the longevity decreased when plants
   received low compared with high water input. In conclusion, the
   omnivorous predator may be obliged to feed on plants to obtain water,
   and plant water status may be a limiting factor for the foraging
   behavior and fitness of the omnivorous predator.}},

Abstract = {{Previous theoretical studies suggest that a species' landscape should
   influence the evolution of its dispersal characteristics, because
   landscape structure affects the costs and benefits of dispersal.
   However, these studies have not considered the evolution of boundary
   crossing, that is, the tendency of animals to cross from habitat to
   nonhabitat ({''}matrix{''}). It is important to understand this
   dispersal behavior, because of its effects on the probability of
   population persistence. Boundary-crossing behavior drives the rate of
   interaction with matrix, and thus, it influences the rate of movement
   among populations and the risk of dispersal mortality. We used an
   individual-based, spatially explicit model to simulate the evolution of
   boundary crossing in response to landscape structure. Our simulations
   predict higher evolved probabilities of boundary crossing in landscapes
   with more habitat, less fragmented habitat, higher-quality matrix, and
   more frequent disturbances (i.e., fewer generations between local
   population extinction events). Unexpectedly, our simulations also
   suggest that matrix quality and disturbance frequency have much stronger
   effects on the evolution of boundary crossing than either habitat amount
   or habitat fragmentation. Our results suggest that boundary-crossing
   responses are most affected by the costs of dispersal through matrix and
   the benefits of escaping local extinction events. Evolution of optimal
   behavior at habitat boundaries in response to the landscape may have
   implications for species in human-altered landscapes, because this
   behavior may become suboptimal if the landscape changes faster than the
   species' evolutionary response to that change. Understanding how matrix
   quality and habitat disturbance drive evolution of behavior at
   boundaries, and how this in turn influences the extinction risk of
   species in human-altered landscapes should help us identify species of
   conservation concern and target them for management.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is associated with a range of health outcomes that are of
   clinical and public health significance, including cancer. Herein, we
   summarize epidemiologic and preclinical evidence for an association

   studies of weight change in humans and from calorie-restriction studies
   in mouse models that support a potential role for weight loss in
   counteracting tumor-promoting properties of obesity in breast and
   prostate cancers. Given that weight loss is challenging to achieve and
   maintain, we also consider evidence linking treatments for
   obesity-associated co-morbidities, including metformin, statins and
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with reduced breast and prostate
   cancer incidence and mortality. Finally, we highlight several challenges

   research in the area of obesity and cancer, including the measurement of
   obesity in population-based studies, the timing of obesity and weight
   change in relation to tumor latency and cancer diagnosis, and the
   heterogeneous nature of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Given
   that obesity is a complex trait, comprised of behavioral, epidemiologic
   and molecular/metabolic factors, we argue that a transdisciplinary

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Three factors potentially facilitating avian urban colonisation are: (a)
   inherent suitability for city environments, (b) limited resource overlap
   with residents, achieved through resource partitioning or outcompeting
   residents for shared resources, and (c) behavioural flexibility
   permitting innovative resource exploitation. We examined the foraging
   ecology and nest site choice of the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala)
   in urban parks in Melbourne, Australia to elucidate which of these three
   factors was likely to be instrumental in facilitating occupancy of this
   urban habitat by this native honeyeater. The Noisy Miner was relatively
   unspecialised in its nest site choice in parks, suggesting that the many
   suburban parks with branching eucalypts probably provide lots of
   suitable nest sites for this species. Park-dwelling Noisy Miners
   appeared to be superior competitors for food to most cohabiting bird
   species. They were never targets of interspecific aggression, but quite
   often initiated it against 16 other bird species. Most interactions were
   attacks and/or chases and 74\% displaced the target species' member. In
   Melbourne's parks, Noisy Miners foraged for invertebrates mainly: (a) in
   the subcanopy on foliage, using hanging and reaching behaviours, and (b)
   on the ground on bark litter and grass, gleaning in a standing posture.
   Several cohabiting bird species also gleaned invertebrates on the ground
   in a similar manner, but all also commonly used other behaviours when
   foraging on this substrate. No cohabiting species that foraged
   extensively in the sub-canopy fed substantially on invertebrates there.
   Thus Noisy Miners could successfully inhabit Melbourne's parks
   apparently at least partly because: (i) nest site choice was relatively
   unspecialised; (ii) they flexibly exploited food resources at ground
   level, unlike exurban conspecifics; (iii) they aggressively dominated
   possible heterospecific food competitors at ground level; and (iv) they
   probably experienced fairly limited dietary overlap with cohabiting bird
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Background Shared decision making (SDM) holds great potential for
   improving the therapeutic efficiency and quality of nutritional
   treatment of dyslipidaemia by promoting patient involvement in decision
   making. Adoption of specific behaviours fostering SDM during
   consultations has yet to be studied in routine dietetic practice.
   Objective Using a cross-sectional study design, we aimed to explore both
   dieticians' and patients' adoption of SDM behaviours in dietetic
   consultations regarding the nutritional treatment of dyslipidaemia.
   Methods Twenty-six dieticians working in local health clinics in the
   Quebec City metropolitan area were each asked to identify one
   dyslipidaemic patient they would see in an upcoming consultation. Based
   on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), questionnaires were designed
   to study two targeted SDM behaviours: `to discuss nutritional treatment
   options for dyslipidaemia' and `to discuss patients' values and
   preferences about nutritional treatment options for dyslipidaemia'.
   These questionnaires were administered to the dietician-patient dyad
   individually before the consultation. Associations between TPB
   constructs (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control)
   towards behavioural intentions were analysed using Spearman's partial
   correlations.
   Results Thirteen unique patient-dietician dyads completed the study.
   Perceived behavioural control was the only TPB construct significantly
   associated with both dieticians' and patients' intentions to adopt the
   targeted SDM behaviours (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions As perceived behavioural control seems to determine
   dieticians' and patients' adoption of SDM behaviours, interventions
   addressing barriers and reinforcing enablers of these behaviours are
   indicated. This exploratory study highlights issues that could be
   addressed in future research endeavours to expand the knowledge base

Abstract = {{Riparian disturbance often yields stream amphibian declines, yet some
   populations persist at low densities in impaired ecosystems.
   Understanding behaviors of individuals that select to occupy degraded
   habitat provides important insight into amphibian declines and may
   identify effective targets for management. Our objective was to evaluate
   whether fine-scale habitat selection behaviors and responses to
   environmental cues differed between individuals inhabiting disturbed
   versus undisturbed habitats. Specifically, we evaluated habitat
   selection and movement biases by larval Desmognathus quadramaculatus
   (Black-bellied Salamanders) from streams with and without riparian
   forest cover to different habitat cues. In a laboratory setting, we
   observed habitat selection with respect to light, a potential predator,
   and refuge, and also recorded exploratory movement to determine if
   salamanders occupying deforested stream reaches exhibited bold
   behavioral syndromes. We found that salamanders did not exhibit
   correlated behaviors indicative of bold or shy behavioral syndromes, but
   individuals from deforested stream reaches were less responsive to
   light. Secondly, we evaluated reactive behaviors by exposing salamanders
   to different light regimes. Individuals from deforested reaches
   exhibited greater reactivity to match their habituated light regime.
   Individuals originating from deforested habitats had relatively poor
   body conditions, indicating that individuals from deforested streams may
   experience additional costs relative to those from forested habitats.
   Despite demonstrated declines in abundance of aquatic salamanders
   following riparian disturbance, our results indicated that individuals
   that exhibit high behavioral plasticity are capable of inhabiting
   altered stream habitats and may represent the future of populations in
   disturbed areas.}},

Abstract = {{Social relationships are fundamental to animals living in complex
   societies {[}1-3]. The extent to which individuals base their decisions
   around their key social relationships, and the consequences this has on
   their behavior and broader population level processes, remains unknown.
   Using a novel experiment that controlled where individual wild birds
   (great tits, Parus major) could access food, we restricted mated pairs
   from being allowed to forage at the same locations. This introduced a
   conflict for pair members between maintaining social relationships and
   accessing resources. We show that individuals reduce their own access to
   food in order to sustain their relationships and that individual
   foraging activity was strongly influenced by their key social
   counterparts. By affecting where individuals go, social relationships
   determined which conspecifics they encountered and consequently shaped
   their other social associations. Hence, while resource distribution can
   determine individuals' spatial and social environment {[}4-8], we
   illustrate how key social relationships themselves can govern broader
   social structure. Finally, social relationships also influenced the
   development of social foraging strategies. In response to forgoing
   access to resources, maintaining pair bonds led individuals to develop a
   flexible ``scrounging{''} strategy, particularly by scrounging from
   their pair mate. This suggests that behavioral plasticity can develop to
   ameliorate conflicts between social relationships and other demands.
   Together, these results illustrate the importance of considering social
   relationships for explaining behavioral variation due to their
   significant impact on individual behavior and demonstrate the
   consequences of key relationships for wider processes.}},

   of intra-generational PMN. Naive Sprague Dawley (SD) dams
   pre-gestationally switched to LP (8\% protein) or HP (20\% protein)
   diets for 45 days were bred and maintained throughout gestation on same

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Increased population density may lead to a decrease in energy available
   for growth and reproduction via effects on the activity level of
   individuals. Whilst this may be of particular importance for organisms
   that compete for defendable resources and/or have a high frequency of
   social interactions, it is less obvious how individual activity should
   covary with population density when food resources are not defendable or
   direct interactions among individuals are negligible. Based on
   observations that there is a general negative relationship between
   population density and metabolism it has been suggested that organisms
   actively reduce activity under increased density to accommodate an
   expected decrease in food availability. However, in the absence of
   direct activity measurements the validity of this hypothesis is unclear.
   Here we test for such anticipatory adjustments of activity levels in the
   planktonic cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus, a filter feeder whose food
   resources are not defendable, meaning that density responses can be
   evaluated in the absence of direct interactions. We tested for changes
   in activity in response to two separate density cues, one being the
   direct physical and visual stimuli resulting from being in the vicinity
   of conspecifics ('direct density experiment'), and the other being the
   detection of olfactory cues in their environment ('olfactory cue
   experiment'). Ten genetically distinct clones were used to evaluate the
   potential for genetic variation in these responses. Our measures of
   activity were highly repeatable, and there was significant variation in
   activity among clones. Furthermore, this clonal variation was consistent
   in the `direct density' and `olfactory cue' experiments. The estimated
   evolvability of the trait (1.3-3.2\%) was within the range typically
   observed in behavioural traits. However, there was no indication that
   the activity level of individuals respond to population density, either
   directly to actual density or to olfactory cues representing high
   density. In this case, the energetic influence of density on population
   dynamics is sufficiently described by effects on per capita resource
   availability.}},

   Results There has been a definite change in the phenotype of CP in India

Abstract = {{The success of new food technologies largely depends on consumers'
   behavioral responses to the innovation. In Eastern Africa, and Uganda in
   particular, a technology to process matooke into flour has been
   introduced with limited success. We measure and apply the Food
   technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS) to this specific case. This technique
   has been increasingly used in consumer research to determine consumers'
   fear for foods produced by novel technologies. Although it has been
   successful in developed countries, the low number and limited scope of
   past studies underlines the need for testing its applicability in a
   developing country context. Data was collected from 209 matooke
   consumers from Central Uganda. In general, respondents are relatively
   neophobic towards the new technology, with an average FTNS score of
   58.7\%, which hampers the success of processed matooke flour. Besides
   socio-demographic indicators, `risk perception', `healthiness' and the
   `necessity of technologies' were key factors that influenced consumer's
   preference of processed matooke flour. Benchmarking the findings against
   previous FTNS surveys allows to evaluate factor solutions, compare
   standardized FTNS scores and further lends support for the
   multidimensionality of the FTNS. Being the first application in a
   developing country context, this study provides a case for examining
   food technology neophobia for processed staple crops in various regions
   and cultures. Nevertheless, research is needed to replicate this method
   and evaluate the external validity of our findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Freshwater fishes utilising seasonally available habitats within annual
   migratory circuits time movements out of such habitats with changing
   hydrology, although individual attributes of fish may also mediate the
   behavioural response to environmental conditions. We tagged juvenile
   Arctic grayling in a seasonally flowing stream on the Arctic Coastal
   Plain in Alaska and recorded migration timing towards overwintering
   habitat. We examined the relationship between individual migration date,
   and fork length (FL) and body condition index (BCI) for fish tagged in
   June, July and August in three separate models. Larger fish migrated
   earlier; however, only the August model suggested a significant
   relationship with BCI. In this model, 42\% of variability in migration
   timing was explained by FL and BCI, and fish in better condition were
   predicted to migrate earlier than those in poor condition. Here, the
   majority (33\%) of variability was captured by FL with an additional 9\%
   attributable to BCI. We also noted strong seasonal trends in BCI
   reflecting overwinter mass loss and subsequent growth within the study
   area. These results are interpreted in the context of size and energetic
   state-specific risks of overwinter starvation and mortality (which can
   be very high in the Arctic), which may influence individuals at greater
   risk to extend summer foraging in a risky, yet prey rich, habitat. Our
   research provides further evidence that heterogeneity among individuals
   within a population can influence migratory behaviour and identifies
   potential risks to late season migrants in Arctic beaded stream habitats
   influenced by climate change and petroleum development.}},

Abstract = {{Past risk-sensitive foraging studies commonly manipulated delay to

   designed to explore rats' preference for a variable or fixed option when
   delay to reward and reward quality were manipulated. Using a
   within-subjects, ABACADA design, rats (N = 10) choose between a variable
   and constant option that delivered six food pellets but the amount of
   sugar (i.e. reward quality) and delay to reward differed per condition.
   In each baseline condition, pellets were 100\% sugar and delivered after
   a 2 s mean delay. Subjects displayed a significant preference for the

   responses among all treatments when both reward quality and delay to
   reward were manipulated (i.e. 20\% sugar pellets and 10 s mean delay).
   Preference was assessed relative to the daily energy budget rule, the
   scalar utility theory and the sequential choice model. The sequential
   choice model provided the most comprehensive and accurate prediction of
   subjects' preferences. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{A key aspect of cooperation is partner choice: choosing the best
   available partner improves the chances of a successful cooperative
   interaction and decreases the likelihood of being exploited. However, in
   studies on cooperation subjects are rarely allowed to freely choose
   their partners. Group-living animals live in a complex social
   environment where they can choose among several social partners
   differing in, for example, sex, age, temperament, or dominance status.
   Our study investigated whether wild Barbary macaques succeed to
   cooperate using an experimental apparatus, and whether individual and
   social factors affect their choice of partners and the degree of
   cooperation. We used the string pulling task that requires two monkeys
   to manipulate simultaneously a rope in order to receive a food reward.
   The monkeys were free to interact with the apparatus or not and to
   choose their partner. The results showed that Barbary macaques are able
   to pair up with a partner to cooperate using the apparatus. High level
   of tolerance between monkeys was necessary for the initiation of
   successful cooperation, while strong social bond positively affected the
   maintenance of cooperative interactions. Dominance status, sex, age, and
   temperament of the subjects also affected their choice and performance.
   These factors thus need to be taken into account in cooperative
   experiment on animals. Tolerance between social partners is likely to be
   a prerequisite for the evolution of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Prey use chemical cues from predation events to obtain information about
   predation risk to alter their phenotypes. Though we know how many prey
   respond to predators, we still have a poor understanding of the
   processes and chemical cues involved during a predation event. We
   examined how gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) altered their
   behavior and morphology when raised with cues from different stages of
   predator attack, predators fed different amounts of prey, and predators
   consuming different combinations of treefrog tadpoles or snails
   (Helisoma trivolvis). We found that starved predators and predators fed
   snails induced no defensive responses whereas tadpoles exposed to a
   predator consuming gray treefrogs induced greater hiding, lower
   activity, and relatively deeper tails. We also found that the tadpoles
   did not respond to crushed, chewed, or digested conspecifics, but they
   did respond to consumed (i.e., chewed plus digested) conspecifics. When
   we increased the treefrog biomass consumed by predators, tadpoles
   frequently increased their defenses when only tadpoles were consumed and
   always increased their defenses when the total diet biomass was held
   constant via the inclusion of snails. When predators experienced
   temporal variation in diet composition, including cues from snails to
   cause additional digestive cues or chemical noise, there was no effect
   on tadpole phenotypes. Our results suggest that amphibian prey rely on
   cues from both chewing and digestion of conspecifics and that the
   presence of cues from digested heterospecifics play little or no role in
   adding chemical noise or increased digestive enzymes and by-products
   that could potentially interfere with induced defenses.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{108-115}},

Abstract = {{1. Body condition indices, measures of body `plumpness' or mass relative
   to frame size, are often used as a proxy for lipid reserves or
   fitness-related traits of animals and assumed to be positively related
   to fitness.
   2. The quantification and analysis of body condition indices has been
   the subject of debate for decades. Here, we summarize three additional
   concerns with the use of body condition indices.
   3. First, body condition index is often poorly correlated with lipid
   content in animals. Second, even if body condition index and lipid
   content are correlated, lipid content of an animal may not be the most
   important aspect of body composition influencing fitness. Finally,
   neither body condition index nor lipid reserves are likely to be
   directly positively related to fitness in animals, as many animals
   homeostatically regulate intermediate levels of condition index or lipid
   reserves, with both higher and lower values incurring fitness costs.
   4. A wide range of analytical methods, including some relatively
   inexpensive and simple measures, are available for more detailed
   measures of animal body composition or fitness-related traits. Replacing
   body condition indices with more direct measures of body composition -
   even relatively simple measures - can inform understanding of the
   physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses in a wide range of
   behavioural, ecological and evolutionary studies.}},

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{298-321}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in documenting and explaining the existence
   of marked intraspecific variation in metabolic rate in animals, with
   fishes providing some of the best-studied examples. After accounting for
   variation due to other factors, there can typically be a two to
   three-fold variation among individual fishes for both standard and
   maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR). This variation is reasonably
   consistent over time (provided that conditions remain stable), and its
   underlying causes may be influenced by both genes and developmental
   conditions. In this paper, current knowledge of the extent and causes of
   individual variation in SMR, MMR and aerobic scope (AS), collectively
   its metabolic phenotype, is reviewed and potential links among
   metabolism, behaviour and performance are described. Intraspecific
   variation in metabolism has been found to be related to other traits:
   fishes with a relatively high SMR tend to be more dominant and grow
   faster in high food environments, but may lose their advantage and are
   more prone to risk-taking when conditions deteriorate. In contrast to
   the wide body of research examining links between SMR and behavioural
   traits, very little work has been directed towards understanding the
   ecological consequences of individual variation in MMR and AS. Although
   AS can differ among populations of the same species in response to
   performance demands, virtually nothing is known about the effects of AS
   on individual behaviours such as those associated with foraging or
   predator avoidance. Further, while factors such as food availability,
   temperature, hypoxia and the fish's social environment are known to
   alter resting and MMRs in fishes, there is a paucity of studies
   examining how these effects vary among individuals, and how this
   variation relates to behaviour. Given the observed links between
   metabolism and measures of performance, understanding the metabolic
   responses of individuals to changing environments will be a key area for
   future research because the environment will have a strong influence on
   which animals survive predation, become dominant and ultimately have the
   highest reproductive success. Although current evidence suggests that
   variation in SMR may be maintained within populations via
   context-dependent fitness benefits, it is suggested that a more
   integrative approach is now required to fully understand how the
   environment can modulate individual performance via effects on metabolic
   phenotypes encompassing SMR, MMR and AS.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article shows how an interaction between economic constraints and
   children's taste preferences shapes low-income families' food decisions.
   According to studies of eating behavior, children often refuse
   unfamiliar foods 8 to 15 times before accepting them. Using 80
   interviews and 41 grocery-shopping observations with 73 primary
   caregivers in the Boston area in 2013-2015, I find that many low-income
   respondents minimize the risk of food waste by purchasing what their
   children like often calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. High-income
   study participants, who have greater resources to withstand the cost of
   uneaten food, are more likely to repeatedly introduce foods that their
   children initially refuse. Several conditions moderate the relationship
   between children's taste aversion and respondents' risk aversion,
   including household-level food preferences, respondents' conceptions of
   adult authority, and children's experiences outside of the home.
   Low-income participants' risk aversion may affect children's taste
   acquisition and eating habits, with implications for socioeconomic
   disparities in diet quality. This article proposes that the cost of
   providing children a healthy diet may include the possible cost of foods
   that children waste as they acquire new tastes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Supplementation of Korean Red Ginseng improves behavior deviations in
   animal models of autism}},
Journal = {{FOOD \& NUTRITION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous
   neurodevelopmental disorders that primarily display social and
   communication impairments and restricted/repetitive behaviors. ASD
   prevalence has increased in recent years, yet very limited therapeutic
   targets and treatments are available to counteract the incapacitating
   disorder. Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) is a popular herbal plant in South
   Korea known for its wide range of therapeutic effects and nutritional
   benefits and has recently been gaining great scientific attention,
   particularly for its positive effects in the central nervous system.
   Objectives: Thus, in this study, we investigated the therapeutic
   potential of KRG in alleviating the neuro-behavioral deficits found in
   the valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mice models of ASD.
   Design: Starting at 21 days old (P21), VPA-exposed mice were given daily
   oral administrations of KRG solution (100 or 200 mg/kg) until the
   termination of all experiments. From P28, mice behaviors were assessed
   in terms of social interaction capacity (P28 - 29), locomotor activity
   (P30), repetitive behaviors (P32), short-term spatial working memory
   (P34), motor coordination (P36), and seizure susceptibility (P38).
   Results: VPA-exposed mice showed sociability and social novelty
   preference deficits, hyperactivity, increased repetitive behavior,
   impaired spatial working memory, slightly affected motor coordination,
   and high seizure susceptibility. Remarkably, long-term KRG treatment in
   both dosages normalized all the ASD-related behaviors in VPA-exposed
   mice, except motor coordination ability.
   Conclusion: As a food and herbal supplement with various known benefits,
   KRG demonstrated its therapeutic potential in rescuing abnormal
   behaviors related to autism caused by prenatal environmental exposure to
   VPA.}},

   surgery candidates: What should we assess, why and how?}},
Journal = {{PRESSE MEDICALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-39}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bariatric surgery is indicated in obese patients with a BMI >= 40
   kg/m(2) or >= 35 kg/m(2) with serious comorbidities, in second intention
   in patients who failed to achieve significant weight loss after a
   well-managed medical, nutritional and psychotherapeutic treatment for 6
   to 12 months, and in patients who are aware of the consequences of
   bariatric surgery and who agree with a long term medical and surgical
   follow-up. Such a treatment requires a preoperative multidisciplinary
   assessment and management, which includes a mandatory consultation with
   a psychiatrist or a psychologist that should be member of the
   multidisciplinary staff and participate in these staffs.
   Although one of this consultation's aim is to screen for the few
   patients who for which surgery is contra-indicated, in most cases, the
   main aim of this assessment is to screen for and manage psychiatric and
   psychopathologic disorders that could be temporary contra-indication,
   because these disorders could lead to poorer postoperative outcome when
   untreated. By explaining to the patient how these disorders could affect
   postoperative outcome and which benefits he could retrieve from their
   management, the patient will increase his motivation for change and he
   will be more likely to seek professional help for these disorders. In
   all cases, a systematic examination of the patient's personality and
   his/ her ability to understand the postoperative instructions is
   essential before surgery because clinicians should check that the
   patient is able to be adherent to postoperative instructions. In
   addition to clinical interview, use of self-administered questionnaires
   before the consultation might help to determine which psychiatric or
   psychopathologic factors should be more closely screened during the
   consultation.
   Psychiatric disorders and addictions are highly prevalent in this
   population (e. g., mood and anxiety disorders, binge eating disorder,
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addictions, personality
   disorders, pathological personality traits and dimensions), and when
   untreated, they can lead to poorer postoperative outcome (postoperative
   occurrence of psychiatric disorders, poorer quality of life, and
   sometimes to poorer weight loss or excessive weight rebound when the
   disorder is present during the postoperative period). A complementary
   training in addiction medicine is helpful given the higher risk for
   addictions in this population.
   Given that this evaluation is often the first meeting with a
   psychiatrist, an empathic and motivational approach is helpful to
   improve the patient's ability to request for a future psychiatric
   consultation during the follow-up.
   Some conditions are required for a high quality assessment: the
   objectives and expectations of the consultation should be systematically
   explained to the patient prior to the consultation by the physician who
   enquires for the assessment; it needs time; the psychiatrist should
   systematically be member of the multidisciplinary staff and should take
   part in regular multisciplinary staff meetings; patients should be seen
   alone to assess his/her readiness to change. After the consultation, a
   contact with the physician who enquires for the assessment should be
   systematic (e. g., use of a medical letter that sum up the main
   conclusions of the consultation; participation in regular
   multisciplinary staff meetings).}},

Journal = {{AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Abstract = {{Early developmental conditions can have a strong influence on the life
   history. Fire salamanders represent an interesting system due to their
   biphasic life cycle consisting of an aquatic larval stage and a
   subsequent terrestrial stage. The environment experienced as larvae
   affects growth, age at metamorphosis and behaviour. In particular, diet
   restrictions can cause developmental stress. However, the impact of such
   developmental stress on the growth and behaviour in a long-lived
   amphibian are not yet well studied. We manipulated the early diet of
   sibling pairs of fire salamander larvae. One sibling was raised under
   food-restriction and the other was raised under conditions of abundant
   food. We report long-term effects on growth and exploratory behaviour;
   exploratory behaviour was tested in two sessions, first as young
   juveniles and later as sub-adults. We found that food-restricted
   conditions during early development affected exploratory behaviour.
   Early deficits in body mass and body size were compensated later in
   life, by approximately 18 months of age. When morphological differences
   were compensated, the initial differences in exploratory behaviour also
   disappeared. Thus, compensation not only led to an alignment of body
   parameters but was also accompanied by an adjustment in exploratory
   behaviour. No cost of compensation was detected, but future research
   will need to verify whether the potential costs of compensation are
   negligible in slow-growing salamanders or whether they are shifted to
   later life stages. Our study provides novel insights into the life
   history of fire salamanders and reveals that early larval conditions
   have effects on individuals long after metamorphosis.}},

Abstract = {{Binary choice experiments under natural solar radiation were used to
   test short-term behavioral responses of freshwater calanoid copepods to
   ultraviolet radiation (UV). Responses of the nine species from 15
   populations spanning North and South America included both UV attraction
   and UV avoidance, and varied among habitats, species and populations.
   Copepods from more transparent lakes were more attracted to UV than
   those from less transparent lakes. When individuals were pre-exposed in
   the laboratory to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the
   presence and absence of UV, those pre-exposed to UV spent more time in
   the high UV environment than those exposed to PAR alone. However, these
   differences disappeared after 150 min, suggesting that the responses
   were short term and mediated in part by ambient UV conditions. Copepods
   represent a large proportion of the biomass of zooplankton in many
   aquatic ecosystems, and their ability to detect and respond behaviorally
   to UV may enable them to use this ubiquitous environmental cue to
   regulate their water column position. The use of UV as a habitat
   selection cue may permit copepods to exploit optimal food environments

   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study was conducted among

   Findings - The main results demonstrated that attitude and perceived
   difficulty are the antecedents of purchase intentions. Perceived risk
   had a negative relationship with attitude. With respect to lifestyle,
   novelty was positively related to attitude, and freshness was negatively
   related. In addition, novelty had only an indirect effect on intention,
   which was mediated by attitude. A wired lifestyle had a positive
   relationship with attitude, and a negative relationship with perceived

Abstract = {{Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral
   plasticity, animals live in complex environments wherein multiple
   environmental factors vary simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether
   temperature and food intake independently or interactively affected the
   boldness and feeding behavior of juvenile corn snakes (Pantherophis
   guttatus, Linnaeus). Because thermal environments in which animals can
   behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely
   more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant
   temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred
   thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed
   individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food
   intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we
   demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on
   behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently
   affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these
   factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e.,
   multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert
   multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of
   individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food
   availability) may be an overly simplistic approach to understanding how
   animals respond to rapidly changing environments.}},

Abstract = {{The principle aim of the present study is to synthesis a novel
   mesoporous silica-based dual drug delivery system (DDDS) with unique
   features for the delivery of amoxicillin (antibiotic) and thiamine
   hydrochloride (vitamin). The DDDS was characterized by Fourier transform
   infrared, X ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning
   electron microscopy and atomic force micrographs analyses. The stimuli
   response behaviour of the drug carrier was studied by conducting
   swelling experiments as a function of pH and time. Drug release studies
   were carried out by mimicking gastric and intestinal conditions and
   found that the release of both drugs attained its maximum in the
   intestinal condition. The in vitro release data were analysed using
   Peppa's potential equation in order to predict the release mechanism.
   The release of antibiotic follows non-Fickian mechanism whereas that of
   vitamin was diffusion controlled. An in vitro cytotoxicity analysis was
   carried out on L929 cells and the results showed that the synthesized
   DDDS is safe. DPPH assay and antibacterial activity were also analysed.
   From the investigation, it is evident that the prepared DDDS has
   potential application as dual drug carrier.}},

Abstract = {{Movement makes prey more vulnerable to predators. Antipredator responses
   usually have associated costs such as reduced feeding activity, and

   antipredator behavioural responses of Pleurodema thaul tadpoles (diet
   treatment) before adding food or water (incentive treatment) while the
   tadpoles were exposed to alarm cues. Under predation risk, normally fed
   tadpoles showed decreased overall activity, whereas poorly fed tadpoles
   spent more time feeding after food was provided. Tadpoles in all
   treatments decreased their swimming activity but not their feeding
   activity. Our study showed that swimming behaviour was more sensitive to
   predation risk than feeding behaviour. We suggest that the motivational
   state of tadpoles under different environmental conditions should be
   considered when behavioural patterns are analysed to understand
   short-term trade-offs between foraging requirements and predator

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{353-364}},
Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves complex cognitive abilities,
   including risky decision-making; the modulation of this brain area is
   shown to alter the way people take risks. Yet, neuromodulation of the
   PFC in relation to risk-taking behavior remains relatively less
   well-studied. Moreover, the psychological variables that influence such
   neuromodulation remain poorly understood. To address these issues, 16
   participants took part in 3 experimental sessions on separate days. They
   received: (i) left anodal-right cathodal transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS); (ii) left cathodal-right anodal stimulation; or
   (iii) sham stimulation while they completed two risk-taking tasks. They
   also measured on several cognitive-affective abilities and personality
   traits. It was revealed that left cathodal-right anodal stimulation led
   to significantly reduced risk-taking under a context of haste. The
   reduction of risk-taking (relative to sham) correlated with state and
   trait impulsivity, such that the effect was larger in more impulsive
   individuals. For these individuals, the tDCS effect size was considered
   to be large (generalized partial eta(2) >.17). The effect of
   prefrontal-neuromodulation in reducing risk-taking was influenced by
   baseline impulsivity, reflecting a state-dependent effect of
   neuromodulation on the PFC. The results of this study carry important
   insights into the use of neuromodulation to alter higher cognition.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term weight management of obesity remains a very difficult
   task, associated with a high risk of failure and weight regain. However,
   many people report that they have successfully managed weight loss
   maintenance in the long term. Several factors have been associated with
   better weight loss maintenance in long-term observational and randomized
   studies. A few pertain to the behavioral area (eg, high levels of
   physical activity, eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet; frequent
   self-monitoring of weight), a few to the cognitive component (eg,
   reduced disinhibition, satisfaction with results achieved, confidence in
   being able to lose weight without professional help), and a few to
   personality traits (eg, low novelty seeking) and patient-therapist
   interaction. Trials based on the most recent protocols of lifestyle
   modification, with a prolonged extended treatment after the weight loss
   phase, have also shown promising long-term weight loss results. These
   data should stimulate the adoption of a lifestyle modification-based
   approach for the management of obesity, featuring a nonphysician
   lifestyle counselor (also called ``lifestyle trainer{''} or ``healthy
   lifestyle practitioner{''}) as a pivotal component of the
   multidisciplinary team. The obesity physicians maintain a primary role

   decision for drug treatment or bariatric surgery, as possible more

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The global obesity epidemic continues, new approaches are
   needed to understand the causes. We analyzed data from an evolutionary
   perspective, stressing developmental plasticity.
   Methods: We present diachronical height, weight, and BMI data for
   702,902 Swiss male conscripts aged 18-20 years, a representative,
   standardized and unchanged data source.
   Results: From 1875 to 1879, the height distribution was slightly
   left-skewed; 12.1\% of the conscripts were underweight, overweight and
   obesity were rare. The BMI-to-height relationship was positive but not
   linear, and very short conscripts were particularly slim. Since the
   1870s, Swiss conscripts became taller, a trend that markedly slowed in
   the 1990s. In contrast, weight increased in two distinct steps at the
   end of the 1980s and again after 2002. Since 2010, BMI did not increase
   but stabilized at a high level.
   Conclusions: The body of young men adapted differently to varying living
   conditions over time: First, less investment in height and weight under
   conditions of undernutrition and food uncertainty; second, more
   investment in height under more stable nutritional conditions; third,
   development of obesity during conditions of plateaued height growth,
   overnutrition, and decreasing physical activity. This example
   contributes to the evaluation of hypotheses on human developmental
   plasticity. (C) 2016 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{45-46}},
Pages = {{2829-2837}},
Abstract = {{Individual nutritional status may increase marginal foraging costs and
   potentially drive animal foraging strategies. Here, we investigated how
   it might affect foraging strategies of the shelter-building spider
   Hingstepeira folisecens (Hingston 1932) (Araneidae). This spider can
   catch prey using two strategies with different relative costs: `pulling'
   (higher energy expenditure) and `pursuing' (lower energy expenditure).
   We conducted experiments by offering prey at a fixed distance from the
   shelter entrance to investigate if spiders with lower nutritional status
   would exhibit riskier but less costly foraging behaviours more
   frequently than spiders with better status. The nutritional status did
   not affect the foraging behaviours adopted by H. folisecens.
   Additionally, the frequency of both foraging behaviours was similar.
   Therefore, our results did not provide any evidence that individual
   nutritional status is a factor driving the selection of foraging
   behaviours in H. folisecens. We suggest that the malnourished spiders
   should adopt additional strategies to compensate for the costs of
   pulling behaviour, especially when prey is far from the shelter.
   Furthermore, it is possible that other factors, like relative prey size
   in relation to web size, can help us to understand the threshold that
   determines when such individuals must adopt one of two possible
   behaviours.}},

Title = {{Food neophobia and ethnic food consumption intention An extension of the
   theory of planned behaviour}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2781-2797}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to serve as groundwork to
   investigate the determinants of ethnic food consumption intention in the
   context of developing markets. Using the theory of planned behaviour as
   the underlying basis, it is aimed to explain the effect of attitude,
   subjective norm and perceived behaviour control on consumption intention
   towards Dayak food. Since Dayak food is relatively unfamiliar compared
   to conventional food in Malaysia, food neophobia is incorporated into
   the model so as to assess its moderation effect on every postulated
   relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach via
   self-administered questionnaire was adopted. In all, 300 copies of the
   questionnaire were distributed to non-Dayak Malaysians, and 211 usable
   copies were subsequently collected, suggesting that non-response bias
   was not a major issue. A post hoc Harman single-factor analysis was also
   performed to ensure the variance in the data was not explained by one
   single factor, thus addressing the common method bias. Structural
   equation modelling using partial least squares approach was then
   utilized to assess the relationships of variables under investigation
   and the moderation effect of food neophobia.
   Findings - After ensuring the data have acceptable reliability and
   validity, structural model assessment was performed to test the
   hypotheses. The findings show that attitude, subjective norm and
   perceived behavioural control all have positive effect on consumption
   intention of non-Dayak Malaysians towards Dayak food. However, food
   neophobia is only found to have a moderation effect on the relationship
   between subjective norm and consumption intention.
   Research limitations/implications - First, the sample is largely
   consisted of college and university students in Malaysia who are
   believed to be more daring to try new things, including new food. Second
   and more importantly, the dearth of literature and empirical studies on
   Dayak food and ethnic food in Malaysia might have actually pointed to
   the limitation in using only quantitative questionnaire in the study. As
   salient beliefs are the antecedents in the theory of planned behaviour,
   knowing consumers' specific beliefs about Dayak food would have provided
   a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of consumption intention
   and the moderating effect of food neophobia.
   Practical implications - The moderation effect of food neophobia on the
   relationship between subjective norm and consumption intention towards
   Dayak food implies the importance of recommendations and favourable
   word-of-mouth from the significant ones, such as family members and
   peers, to make people willing to try and consume it. This corresponds to
   earlier findings pertaining to the collectivistic culture in Malaysia.
   Unlike countries with individualistic cultures, Malaysians tend to
   conform to the consumption choices of significant others. This implies
   that those whom they hold in high regard, are able to influence them
   both positively and negatively through their advice or opinions.
   Originality/value - The present study has not only extended the use of
   theory of planned behaviour in the context of Dayak food consumption
   intention in a developing country, but it has also deepened the theory
   by incorporating food neophobia as the moderator to provide additional
   theoretical explanation to ethnic food consumption intention. Given the
   wealth of Asian culture, and its significant role in the global
   marketplace, the understanding of ethnic food consumption intention of
   the local and foreign consumers using the extended theory of planned
   behaviour would contribute knowledge not only to consumer behaviour, but
   also to food and service industry and tourism.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in personality traits is predicted to reflect physiology, but
   the extent to which variations in stress hormones derive from

   briefly brought into captivity and scored for personality and
   corticosterone (Cort) concentrations. More active females had lower
   baseline Cort than less active individuals. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia did not co-vary with baseline Cort. Stress-induced Cort
   concentrations were correlated negatively with exploratory tendency and
   haematocrit, but positively with mass gain in captivity. Therefore,
   baseline and stress-induced Cort concentrations in wintering blue tits
   were associated with state-dependent variables, sex, age and personality
   traits. Key to interpreting the physiology of personality traits seems
   to be their interactions with other traits that mediate ability to

Abstract = {{Rather diverse than formal education, the informal education does not
   fit generally into the templates proposed by the actual compulsory
   curricula, but proposes various activities open not just to pupils and
   students, but also to general public. In other terms, the informal
   education tries to enrich the formal and non-formal education, without
   the necessity concerning the recognition of the learning activities
   supported by a degree or by a diploma. Usually, the informal education
   takes into consideration the pedagogical influences on each individual
   personality gained especially from the own family, influences from the
   particular living environment social, cultural, political, economic,
   religious etc. -, but also from the local, regional and national
   mass-media radio, television, hard /on-line press.
   In this respect, the paper emphasizes on the role of local/regional
   mass-media for promoting a proper Health Education, especially related
   to the development of pupils and students attitudes/abilities, in order
   to avoid or minimize the risk of getting ill due to a wrong alimentary

Abstract = {{The pig is an excellent model to study human eating behaviour and its
   neurobiological determinants. The pig is omnivorous and has a digestive
   system that closely resembles that of humans. Furthermore, the
   establishment of eating behaviour and food preferences in the pig
   follows the same rules and influences as those identified in humans. It
   is thus possible to observe similar behavioural responses related to
   food in both species, like for instance spontaneous attractions for
   certain basic flavours, or the development of preferences that have been
   conditioned or learned through individual experiences or signals
   perceived in the environment or transmitted by the mother. In addition,
   the brain of pigs and humans shares common developmental, anatomical and
   functional features, thus enabling precise explorations via the use of
   modern techniques of brain functional imaging. The neurobiological
   mechanisms underlying the development of food preferences or aversions
   have been described in the pig model, as well as some neurocognitive
   abnormalities associated with obesity or the chronic consumption of
   deleterious diets. Therefore, the pig can be used as a pertinent model
   to explore new therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain
   stimulation, to fight against obesity and eating disorders. The pig
   model thus offers many opportunities for exploratory and preclinical
   biomedical research in the field of food and nutritional neurosciences.}},

   Dietary Modulation of Behavior}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{The increasing recognition that the gut microbiota plays a central role
   in behavior and cognition suggests that the manipulation of microbial
   taxa through diet may provide a means by which behavior may be altered
   in a reproducible and consistent manner in order to achieve a beneficial
   outcome for the host. Resistant starch continues to receive attention as
   a dietary intervention that can benefit the host through mechanisms that
   include altering the intestinal microbiota. Given the interest in
   dietary approaches to improve health, the aim of this study was to
   investigate whether the use of dietary resistant starch in mice to alter
   the gut microbiota also results in a change in behavior. Forty-eight 6
   week-old male Swiss-Webster mice were randomly assigned to 3 treatment
   groups (n = 16 per group) and fed either a normal corn starch diet (NCS)
   or diets rich in resistant starches HA7 diet (HA7) or octenyl-succinate
   HA7 diet (OS-HA7) for 6 week and monitored for weight, behavior and
   fecal microbiota composition. Animals fed an HA7 diet displayed
   comparable weight gain over the feeding period to that recorded for
   NCS-fed animals while OS-HA7 displayed a lower weight gain as compared
   to either NCS or HA7 animals (ANOVA p = 0.0001; NCS:HA7 p = 0.244;
   HA7:OS-HA7 p<0.0001; NCS:OS-HA7 p<0.0001). Analysis of fecal microbiota
   using 16s rRNA gene taxonomic profiling revealed that each diet

   significant differences between groups in locomotion as a measure of
   transitions across quadrant boundaries. Additionally, the open-field
   assay revealed decreased exploration as well as decreased rearing in HA7

   gut microbiota and should be useful to ``dial-in{''} a specific
   microbiome that is unique to a particular starch composition. However,

Title = {{Motivational techniques to improve self-care in hemophilia: the need to
   support autonomy in children}},
Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: In pediatric hemophilia, caregivers are facing unique
   challenges to adherence and self-care in children and adolescents with
   hemophilia. Hemophilia treatment requires adequate prophylaxis and
   on-demand treatment, as well as a clear behavioral strategy to limit
   risk-taking in terms of physical exercise and diet. Medication adherence
   rates of hemophilia patients have been reported to decrease during late
   childhood and adolescence. In the developing child, moving safely from
   parent-care to self-care is one of the greatest challenges of
   integrative care within this domain. There is a clear need for
   initiatives designed to increase an individual's motivation for
   treatment and self-care activities.
   Discussion: Among motivational approaches, the self-determination
   perspective offers a useful framework to explain how the transition to
   self-care can be facilitated. We discuss how motivation regarding
   hemophilia treatment may be increased through parental autonomy support
   and we offer examples of applied communication techniques to facilitate
   autonomy-supportive caregiving. Although it has not yet been tested in
   the context of hemophilia, these communication techniques could
   potentially help caregivers promote adherence and self-care in children.
   Summary: Confronted by unique challenges to adherence and self-care,
   caregivers of children with hemophilia should move from an exclusive
   focus on illness-management education to an integrative strategy,
   including motivation-enhancing communication. The self-determination
   perspective provides important proximal objectives (e.g. autonomy
   support) to maintain optimal adherence in adolescents as they move from
   parent-care to self-care. Future research initiatives should address the
   practice of these communication techniques and evaluate them in the
   context of hemophilia.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiota plays a major role

   the relative abundance of the bacterial order Lactobacillales was lower
   in offspring born from antibiotic-treated dams (20.7 +/- 3.4\%) than in
   control offspring (42.1 +/- 6.2\%) at P24, while the relative abundance

   offspring born from antibiotic-treated dams (34.2 +/- 5.0\%) than in
   control offspring (16.4 +/- 3.3\%). Offspring born from
   antibiotic-treated dams exhibited low locomotor activity in both
   familiar and novel environments, and preferred to explore in the
   peripheral area of an unfamiliar field at postnatal week 4. At postnatal
   weeks 7-8, no difference was observed in the level of locomotor activity

   while the tendency for the offspring from antibiotic-treated dams to be
   less engaged in exploring the inside area was still observed. The
   behavioral phenotypes of the offspring from antibiotic-treated dams at

   fostering of these offspring by normal dams from postnatal day 1.
   Although the detailed underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated,

Title = {{Low-Income US Women Under-informed of the Specific Health Benefits of
   Consuming Beans}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Bean consumption can reduce chronic disease risk and improve nutrition
   status. Consumer knowledge of bean health benefits could lead to
   increased intakes. Low-income women have poorer health and nutrition,
   but their level of knowledge about bean health benefits is unknown.
   Beans are a familiar food of reasonable cost in most settings and are
   cultural staples for Hispanics and other ethnicities. Study objectives
   were to assess awareness of bean health benefits among low-income women,
   and to evaluate any differences by acculturation status for Hispanic
   women in the Southwestern United States.
   Methods
   A convenience sample of 406 primarily Mexican-origin (70\%) low-income
   women completed a survey on knowledge of bean health benefits and
   general food behaviors. Principal components analysis of responses
   identified two summary scale constructs representing ``bean health
   benefits{''} and ``food behaviors.{''} Acculturation level was the main
   independent variable in chi-square or ANOVA.
   Results
   survey completion rate was 86\% (406/471). Most women agreed or strongly
   agreed that beans improved nutrition (65\%) and were satiating (62\%).
   Over 50\% answered `neutral' to statements that beans could lower LDL
   cholesterol (52\%), control blood glucose (56\%) or reduce cancer risk
   (56\%), indicating indifference or possible lack of knowledge about bean
   health benefits. There were significant differences by acculturation for
   beliefs that beans aid weight loss and intestinal health. Scores on the
   bean health benefits scale, but not the food behavior scale, also
   differed by acculturation.
   Conclusions
   Limited resource women have a favorable view of the nutrition value of
   beans, but the majority did not agree or disagreed with statements about
   bean health benefits. Greater efforts to educate low-income women about
   bean health benefits may increase consumption and improve nutrition.}},

Abstract = {{The functional response describes the relationship between feeding rate

   foraging behaviour may change in response to food availability. The
   effects of habitat complexity and food item size were experimentally
   tested on the foraging parameters and functional responses of the
   freshwater fish roach Rutilus rutilus. Habitat complexity was varied
   through the manipulation of substrate and turbidity, and food item size
   was varied by using fishmeal pellets in two sizes. As water turbidity
   and substrate complexity increased, the reaction distance and
   consumption rate (per number) significantly decreased. Increased food
   item size significantly decreased consumption rates (per number) but had
   no influence on any other foraging parameter. Analysis of the
   interactions between substrate complexity, turbidity and food item size
   revealed food item size had the greatest influence on consumption rate
   (per number). Turbidity had the least effect on all the foraging
   parameters tested. Across all experiments, the functional responses were
   best described by the Type II response, a relatively consistent finding

Abstract = {{The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are
   well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been
   considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager
   population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal
   variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of
   initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality
   and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity.
   Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly.
   Residual lifespan increased by 57 \% when colonies were penned for 20
   days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory.
   Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into
   the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation
   did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population
   size declined when mortality exceeded 4 \% per day. Experimental
   increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to
   foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These
   results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers
   that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the
   well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained
   not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing
   at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker
   depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks,
   opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by
   inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger
   workers.}},

Abstract = {{The maternal environment influences a broad range of phenotypic outcomes
   for offspring, with anxiety like behavior being particularly susceptible
   to maternal environmental perturbations. Much less is known regarding
   paternal environmental influences. To investigate this, adult male rats
   were exposed to 25\% calorie restriction (CR) or glucocorticoid
   elevation (CORT; 200 mu g/ml of corticosterone in drinking water) for 6
   weeks prior to breeding. Elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF),
   predator odor (cat urine), and acoustic startle/pre-pulse inhibition
   (AS/PPI) were characterised in the adult male offspring. Plasma
   concentrations of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRF),
   adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and serum lepin were characterised
   in both sires and offspring. Maternal care received by litters was
   additionally observed. Expectedly, CR and CORT treatment attenuated
   weight gain, whilst only CR induced anxiolytic behavior in the EPM. The
   adult offspring sired by CR males also demonstrated a reduction in
   weight gain, food intake and serum leptin levels when compared to
   controls. Moreover, CR offspring demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile
   in the EPM and OF, enhanced habituation to the AS pulse, reduced PPI,
   but no alteration to predator odor induced defensiveness compared to
   control. CORT offspring failed to demonstrate any behavioral differences
   from controls, however, exhibited a trend towards reduced ACTH and
   leptin concentration. Collectively, the results indicate that a
   reduction in calories in males prior to conception can affect the
   behavior of adult offspring. The phenotypic transmission of CR
   experiences from fathers to the progeny could potentially be mediated
   epigenetically. The role of glucocorticoid elevation and maternal care

Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effects of social and ecological stressors on female reproductive
   success vary among species and, in mammals, previous reviews have
   identified no clear patterns. However, few studies have simultaneously
   examined the relation between social rank and stressors and the
   relationships among rank, stressors and reproductive success. We used a
   long-term data set to study free-living facultatively social
   yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, to isolate the
   relationship between female social dominance rank and faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels (our measure of basal stress) in
   adult females. In addition, we examined whether rank and FGM levels were
   associated with reproductive success by quantifying the probability of
   an individual successfully weaning a litter and, for those who did,
   litter size. Highranking females had lower FGM levels and larger
   litters. However, females with the highest FGM levels were significantly
   more likely to wean a litter. Importantly, body condition (as measured
   by previous year's mass) was also positively associated with breeding
   and with weaning larger litters. Thus, although low-ranking females
   probably experienced more social stressors than high-ranking females and
   although adult females often delayed their first reproduction until they
   were of a sufficient mass, our results suggest that elevated baseline
   FGM levels failed to mediate reproductive suppression. Perhaps, in
   species like marmots that have only a single chance per year to
   reproduce, reproductive suppression should be rare. These results
   highlight the importance of social status, body condition and predator
   abundance on determining reproductive success in highly seasonal

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{471-485}},

Abstract = {{Many organisms must move among habitats to fulfill life history
   requirements. Fish movements have been widely studied and tend to be
   either fine-scale (i.e., routine) and governed by factors such as food
   availability and cover, or broad-scale and associated with spawning
   migrations. However, movements of invasive fishes in non-native
   ecosystems are comparatively poorly understood despite the often
   critical importance of fish movement and dispersal for invasion success.
   We examined invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) movements
   using acoustic telemetry to monitor the timing, distance, and direction
   of fish movements and assessed movements in relation to seasonal,
   annual, environmental, and individual factors in the Wabash River
   (Indiana, USA), a largely unregulated Midwestern river. Silver Carp
   exhibited highly variable movements that could be rapid and large in
   magnitude; however, tagged individuals remained stationary most of the
   time. Despite high variability, several trends emerged, indicating the
   importance of backwater habitats, avoidance of small tributaries, and
   tendencies of tagged fish to exhibit directed spring and fall
   broad-scale movements. Summer movements were smaller in magnitude,
   characterized by lower movement rates, and evenly split between upstream
   and downstream directions, although tagged Silver Carp moved more
   frequently during summer months. Our results indicate that specific
   seasons (i.e., spring and early fall) and locations (i.e., backwaters)
   are likely targets for Silver Carp control in the Wabash River and
   should also be useful targets for early detection and control in other
   largely unconstrained rivers over a broad geographic range (e.g., Great

Abstract = {{Larvae of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera:
   Lymantriidae), a generalist species, frequently encounter spatial and
   temporal variations in diet quality. Such variation favoured the
   evolution of high behavioural and physiological plasticity which,
   depending on forest stand composition, enables more or less successful
   exploitation of the environment. Even in mixed oak stands, a suitable
   habitat, interspecific and intraspecific host quality variation may
   provoke significant variation in gypsy moth performance and,
   consequently, defoliation severity. To elucidate the insufficiently
   explored relationship between gypsy moth and oaks (Fagaceae), we carried
   out reciprocal switches between Turkey oaks (Quercus cerris L.) and less
   nutritious Hungarian oaks (Quercus frainetto Ten.) (TH and HT groups),
   under controlled laboratory conditions, and compared larval performance
   between the switched larvae and larvae continuously fed on either Turkey
   oak (TT) or Hungarian oak (HH). We found that larval traits were most
   strongly affected by among-tree variation in oak quality and identity of
   the host consumed during the fourth instar. Switching from Turkey to
   Hungarian oak (TH) led to a longer period of feeding, decrease of mass
   gain, growth, and consumption rate, lower efficiency of food use and
   nutrient conversion, and increase of protease and amylase activities.
   Larvae exposed to the reverse switch (HT) attained values of these
   traits characteristic for TT larvae. It appeared that the lower growth
   in the TH group than in the TT group was caused by both behavioural
   (consumption, pre-ingestive) and metabolic (post-digestive) effects from
   consuming oaks. Multivariate analyses of growth, consumption, and
   efficiency of food use revealed that early diet experience influenced
   the sensitivity of themost examined traits to less suitableHungarian
   oaks, suggesting the development of behavioural and physiological
   adjustments. Our results indicate that lower risks of defoliation by
   gypsy mothmight be expected inmixed stands with a higher proportion of
   Hungarian oak.}},

Abstract = {{Background Many young children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) do
   not consume a healthful diet; exactly why this occurs despite T1DM
   education remains poorly understood.
   Objective This study describes parents' perceptions of healthful eating
   for T1DM in young children and identifies factors related to parents'
   dietary management.
   Design A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was performed. Parents
   completed a questionnaire, 3-day weighed diet record, and a
   semi-structured interview regarding their perceptions of healthful
   eating for T1DM and their dietary management practices.
   Participants/setting Twenty-three families, recruited from a pediatric
   diabetes clinic in the midwestern United States between February 2012
   and April 2013, participated. Eligible families had a child with T1DM
   who was 1 to 6 years old, at least 6 months from diagnosis, and was
   following an intensive insulin regimen.
   Statistical analyses performed Mean scores and percentages were
   calculated from the diet diaries and parent questionnaires, and parents'
   interviews were coded to identify common themes.
   Results Results showed that while parents may believe they know what
   constitutes a healthful diet for T1DM, they do not always feed their
   child a healthful diet. Parent-identified barriers to healthful eating
   included limited time to prepare homemade meals, perceived higher costs
   of healthier foods, the influence of peers on children's food
   preferences, and picky eating. Parents also discussed a desire not to
   limit their child's diet or make their child ``feel different,{''} which
   many parents said often led them to give into their child's requests for
   less healthful food options.
   Conclusions Parents of young children with T1DM identified several
   barriers to healthful eating that are common for all parents, such as
   time constraints, expense, and child food preferences. However, unique
   themes emerged, including parents' desire not to limit their child's
   diet or make their child ``feel different.{''} Nutrition components of
   T1DM education should include psychological and behavioral strategies to
   help parents manage these unique concerns.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{298}},

Abstract = {{Daily activity patterns in mammals depend on food availability,
   reproductive stage, habitat selection, intraspecific interactions and
   predation risk, among other factors. Some mammals exhibit behavioral
   plasticity in activity patterns, which allows them to adapt to
   environmental changes. A good example of this can be found in the red
   fox Vulpes vulpes. This species is adapted to living in highly humanized
   environments, where it is often culled because it may affect human
   interests (e.g. through the consumption of game species or livestock).
   We assessed the potential main drivers of the daily activity patterns of
   the red fox in 12 Iberian Mediterranean areas through the use of camera
   traps. Among drivers, we considered main prey availability (European
   wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), degree of human disturbance (e.g.
   distance to human settlements, and intensity of predator control) and
   habitat structure. Our results revealed a predominantly crepuscular and
   nocturnal activity of foxes with local variations. Although overall fox
   activity increased with rabbit availability, the temporal overlap with
   prey activity was on average low, because foxes increased activity when
   rabbits decreased theirs (twilight-night). Red fox activity rhythms
   seemed to be determined by human presence where human disturbance is
   high. In addition, diurnal activity decreased in areas with higher
   levels of human disturbance (closer to human settlements and high
   predator control intensity) and increased in dense habitats. Our study
   shows that daily activity patterns of highly adaptable species are
   determined by several interacting drivers, resulting in complex
   behavioral patterns. This suggests that further ecological studies
   should consider different factors simultaneously for a better
   understanding of daily activity patterns of wildlife in different
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fully understand factors that affect animals during their
   annual cycle, it is important to measure physiological and behavioral
   responses to environmental conditions in multiple seasons. We tested the
   hypothesis that corticosterone levels (CORT) are affected by spatial and
   temporal variations in marine environmental conditions by measuring
   levels in the feathers (grown outside of the breeding season) and blood
   (collected during the breeding season) of an abundant North Pacific
   seabird, the rhinoceros anklet Cerorhinca monocerata. Birds involved in
   our study bred on three widely dispersed colonies in three years in
   which oceanographic conditions differed markedly. Combined nitrogen
   (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope values in blood
   differed among colonies, while values in feathers did not, suggesting
   that individuals from the three colonies were segregated during the
   breeding season (as expected from foraging range around breeding
   colonies), but not during the nonbreeding period (as expected from
   genetic homogeneity). CORT showed the same pattern of dichotomy; of
   particular note, but contrary to our a priori prediction, blood CORT
   levels were higher in anklets that bred on a colony in which early
   chlorophyll-a bloom in local waters suggested good feeding conditions,
   than in anklets that bred on a colony with later local chlorophyll a
   bloom. Also contrary to prediction, feather CORT was higher in a year
   featuring favorable, cold-water La Nina conditions than in a year of
   unfavorable, warm-water El Nino conditions; values in a third, moderate
   year were intermediate. We conclude that CORT levels are affected by
   spatiotemporal variation in marine environmental conditions, but
   relationships appear to depend heavily on context and thus require
   careful interpretation and more study.}},

Abstract = {{Personality disorders are common, and the core problems of interpersonal
   dysfunction and social disturbance are difficult to treat. One area
   gaining international attention is the impact that diet and nutrients
   can have on psychiatric/psychological symptoms. There are no empirical
   studies studying the specific relationship between nutrition and
   personality disorders. A systematic search revealed longitudinal studies
   following malnourished children, either during pregnancy or in early
   life that reported malnourishment is a risk factor that can express as
   maladaptive behaviours later in life. Other studies show associations
   between nutrient intake and personality styles. A small body of
   literature reveals a potential benefit of consuming nutrients
   therapeutically in order to address behaviours often associated with
   personality disorders. If we consider the broad patterns of behaviour
   that typify personality disorders, such as cognition, affectivity,
   interpersonal functioning and impulse control, there is a research
   rationale for studying the role that nutrition could play in protecting
   against the development of these problems as well as possibly modifying
   them. Whether it is too late to intervene with nutrition once the
   pathological behaviours are entrenched is unknown. Given the dearth of
   good evidence-based treatments currently available for people with
   personality disorders, it is an area worth investing in. Copyright (C)

Title = {{The alcohol harm paradox: using a national survey to explore how alcohol
   may disproportionately impact health in deprived individuals}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Internationally, studies show that similar levels of alcohol
   consumption in deprived communities (vs. more affluent) result in higher
   levels of alcohol-related ill health. Hypotheses to explain this alcohol
   harm paradox include deprived drinkers: suffering greater combined
   health challenges (e.g. smoking, obesity) which exacerbate effects of
   alcohol harms; exhibiting more harmful consumption patterns (e.g.
   bingeing); having a history of more harmful consumption; and
   disproportionately under-reporting consumption. We use a bespoke
   national survey to assess each of these hypotheses.
   Methods: A national telephone survey designed to test this alcohol harm
   paradox was undertaken (May 2013 to April 2014) with English adults (n =
   6015). Deprivation was assigned by area of residence. Questions examined
   factors including: current and historic drinking patterns; combined
   health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass); and
   under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special
   occasion drinking). For each factor, analyses examined differences
   between deprived and more affluent individuals controlled for total
   alcohol consumption.
   Results: Independent of total consumption, deprived drinkers were more
   likely to smoke, be overweight and report poor diet and exercise.
   Consequently, deprived increased risk drinkers (male >168-400 g, female
   >112-280 g alcohol/week) were >10 times more likely than non-deprived
   counterparts to drink in a behavioural syndrome combining smoking,
   excess weight and poor diet/exercise. Differences by deprivation were
   significant but less marked in higher risk drinkers (male >400 g, female
   >280 g alcohol/week). Current binge drinking was associated with
   deprivation independently of total consumption and a history of bingeing
   was also associated with deprivation in lower and increased risk
   drinkers.
   Conclusions: Deprived increased/higher drinkers are more likely than
   affluent counterparts to consume alcohol as part of a suite of health
   challenging behaviours including smoking, excess weight and poor
   diet/exercise. Together these can have multiplicative effects on risks
   of wholly (e.g. alcoholic liver disease) and partly (e.g. cancers)
   alcohol-related conditions. More binge drinking in deprived individuals
   will also increase risks of injury and heart disease despite total
   alcohol consumption not differing from affluent counterparts. Public
   health messages on how smoking, poor diet/exercise and bingeing escalate
   health risks associated with alcohol are needed, especially in deprived
   communities, as their absence will contribute to health inequalities.}},

Abstract = {{Food neophobia seems to be related to nutritional, emotional, and family
   problems during childhood and adolescence. However, a specific measure
   to assess food neophobia in this population group is lacking in Spain.
   The aim of this study was to develop and validate a culturally
   appropriate Spanish version of the self-report Food Situations
   Questionnaire (FSQ) published by Loewen and Pliner in 2000. Items were
   translated into Spanish by means of the forward-backward translation
   procedure, using age-appropriate and simple vocabulary. The Spanish Food
   Situations Questionnaire (SFSQ) was then administered to a community
   sample of 831 participants (368 males and 463 females) aged between 8
   and 16. The internal structure (dimensionality), internal consistency,
   and temporal stability of the instrument were examined, as were its
   convergent and external validity. The results of exploratory and
   confirmatory factor analyses revealed, as in the original FSQ a
   two-factor structure (Low Stimulation and High Stimulation). These
   dimensions showed adequate internal consistency and temporal stability.
   The results also provide some evidence of convergent validity. External
   validation data were obtained based on the negative relationship between
   food neophobia and the sensation-seeking personality trait. Overall, the
   present work offers researchers and professionals interested in this
   area of study a valid and reliable tool for assessing food neophobia in

Abstract = {{Current models indicate that an organism's sensitivity to risk may be
   heavily influenced by the trade-off between current and future

   opportunities are expected to show more risky behavior as they have less
   to lose if captured by a predator (the asset protection principle). In
   this study, we examined the effects of age and physical condition on
   risk taking behavior during sexual signaling in the gray treefrog (Hyla
   versicolor) to test the prediction that older and poor condition males
   will take greater risks than their younger or higher-condition
   counterparts. In accordance with these predictions, we found that males
   in low physical condition resumed signaling activity more rapidly
   following a simulated predator attack than their higher-condition
   counterparts, although this effect was only apparent in one of two study
   years. Further, males that resumed calling early did not offset their
   risk of detection by predators via reduced calling effort. Contrary to
   our predictions, we did not find age to be a significant predictor of

Abstract = {{Within the broad discourses of environmental change, sustainability
   science, and anthropogenic Earth-surface systems, a focused body of work
   involves the coupled economic and physical dynamics of developed
   shorelines. Rapid rates of change in coastal environments, from wetlands
   and deltas to inlets and dune systems, help researchers recognize,
   observe, and investigate coupling in natural (non-human) morphodynamics
   and biomorphodynamics. This same intrinsic quality of fast-paced change
   also makes developed coastal zones exemplars of observable coupling
   between physical processes and human activities. In many coastal
   communities, beach erosion is a natural hazard with economic costs that
   coastal management counters through a variety of mitigation strategies,
   including beach replenishment, groynes, revetments, and seawalls. As
   cycles of erosion and mitigation iterate, coastline change and
   economically driven interventions become mutually linked. Emergent
   dynamics of two-way economic-physical coupling is a recent research
   discovery. Having established a strong theoretical basis, research into
   coupled human-coastal systems has passed its early proof-of-concept
   phase. This paper frames three major challenges that need resolving in
   order to advance theoretical and empirical treatments of human-coastal
   systems: (1) codifying salient individual and social behaviors of
   decision-making in ways that capture societal actions across a range of
   scales (thus engaging economics, social science, and policy
   disciplines); (2) quantifying anthropogenic effects on alongshore and
   cross-shore sediment pathways and long-term landscape evolution in
   coastal zones through time, including direct measurement of cumulative
   changes to sediment cells resulting from coastal development and
   management practices (e.g., construction of buildings and artificial
   dunes, bulldozer removal of overwash after major storms); and (3)
   reciprocal knowledge and data exchange between researchers in coastal
   morphodynamics and practitioners of coastal management. Future research
   into human-coastal systems can benefit from decades of interdisciplinary
   work on the complex dynamics of common-pool resources, from
   computational efficiency and new techniques in numerical modeling, and
   from the growing catalog of high-resolution geospatial data for natural

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In 2012, yoga was practiced by 20 million Americans, of whom
   82\% were women. A recent literature review on prenatal yoga noted a
   reduction in some pregnancy complications (ie, preterm birth, lumbar
   pain, and growth restriction) in those who practiced yoga; to date,
   there is no evidence on fetal response after yoga.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the acute changes in maternal and
   fetal response to prenatal yoga exercises using common standardized
   tests to assess the well-being of the maternal-fetal unit.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single, blinded, randomized controlled
   trial. Uncomplicated pregnancies between 28 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks with a
   nonanomalous singleton fetus of women who did not smoke, use narcotics,
   or have prior experience with yoga were included. A computer-generated
   simple randomization sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio was used to
   randomize participants into the yoga or control group. Women in the yoga
   group participated in a 1-time, 1 hour yoga class with a certified
   instructor who taught a predetermined yoga sequence. In the control
   group, each participant attended a 1-time, 1 hour PowerPoint
   presentation by an obstetrician on American Congress of Obstetricians
   and Gynecologists recommendations for exercise, nutrition, and obesity
   in pregnancy. All participants underwent pre- and postintervention
   testing, which consisted of umbilical and uterine artery Doppler
   ultrasound, nonstress testing, a biophysical profile, maternal blood
   pressure, and maternal heart rate. A board-certified maternal-fetal
   medicine specialist, at a different tertiary center, interpreted all
   nonstress tests and biophysical profile data and was blinded to group
   assignment and pre- or post-intervention testing. The primary outcome
   was a change in umbilical artery Doppler systolic to diastolic ratio.
   Sample size calculations indicated 19 women per group would be
   sufficient to detect this difference in Doppler indices (alpha, 0.05;
   power, 80\%). Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of
   variance, a chi(2), and a Fisher exact test. A value of P<.05 was
   considered significant.
   RESULTS: Of the 52 women randomized, 46 (88\%) completed the study.
   There was no clinically significant change in umbilical artery systolic
   to diastolic ratio (P=.34), pulsatility index (P=.53), or resistance
   index (P=.66) between the 2 groups before and after the intervention.
   Fetal and maternal heart rate, maternal blood pressure, and uterine
   artery Dopplers remained unchanged over time. When umbilical artery
   indices were individually compared with gestational age references,
   there was no difference between those who improved or worsened between
   the groups.
   CONCLUSION: There was no significant change in fetal blood flow acutely
   after performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy. Yoga can be
   recommended for low-risk women to begin during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{The transition between shallow and mesophotic coral reef communities in
   the tropics is characterized by a significant gradient in abiotic and
   biotic conditions that could result in potential trade-offs in energy
   allocation. The mesophotic reefs in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands
   have a rich sponge fauna with significantly greater percent cover of
   sponges than in their respective shallow reef communities, but
   relatively low numbers of spongivores. Plakortis angulospiculatus, a
   common sponge species that spans the depth gradient from shallow to
   mesophotic reefs in the Caribbean, regenerates faster following
   predation and invests more energy in protein synthesis at mesophotic
   depths compared to shallow reef conspecifics. However, since P.
   angulospiculatus from mesophotic reefs typically contain lower
   concentrations of chemical feeding deterrents, they are not able to
   defend new tissue from predation as efficiently as conspecifics from
   shallow reefs. Nonetheless, following exposure to predators on shallow
   reefs, transplanted P. angulospiculatus from mesophotic depths developed
   chemical deterrence to predatory fishes. A survey of bioactive extracts
   indicated that a specific defensive metabolite, plakortide F, varied in
   concentration with depth, producing altered deterrence between shallow
   and mesophotic reef P. angulospiculatus. Different selective pressures
   in shallow and mesophotic habitats have resulted in phenotypic
   plasticity within this sponge species that is manifested in variable
   chemical defense and tissue regeneration at wound sites.}},

Abstract = {{Predation risk can strongly constrain how individuals use time and
   space. Grouping is known to reduce an individual's time investment in
   costly antipredator behaviours. Whether grouping might similarly provide
   a spatial release from antipredator behaviour and allow individuals to
   use risky habitat more and, thus, improve their access to resources is
   poorly known. We used mosquito larvae, Aedes aegypti, to test the
   hypothesis that grouping facilitates the use of high-risk habitat. We
   provided two habitats, one darker, low-risk and one lighter, high-risk,
   and measured the relative time spent in the latter by solitary larvae
   versus larvae in small groups. We tested larvae reared under different
   resource levels, and thus presumed to vary in body condition, because
   condition is known to influence risk taking. We also varied the degree
   of contrast in habitat structure. We predicted that individuals in
   groups should use high-risk habitat more than solitary individuals
   allowing for influences of body condition and contrast in habitat
   structure. Grouping strongly influenced the time spent in the high-risk
   habitat, but, contrary to our expectation, individuals in groups spent
   less time in the high-risk habitat than solitary individuals.
   Furthermore, solitary individuals considerably increased the proportion
   of time spent in the high-risk habitat over time, whereas individuals in
   groups did not. Both solitary individuals and those in groups showed a
   small increase over time in their use of riskier locations within each
   habitat. The differences between solitary individuals and those in
   groups held across all resource and contrast conditions. Grouping may,
   thus, carry a poorly understood cost of constraining habitat use. This
   cost may arise because movement traits important for maintaining group
   cohesion (a result of strong selection on grouping) can act to
   exaggerate an individual preference for low-risk habitat. Further
   research is needed to examine the interplay between grouping, individual
   movement and habitat use traits in environments heterogeneous in risk
   and resources. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{For many species sexual signaling is a very costly activity, both in
   terms of energetic expenditure and increased conspicuousness to
   predators. One potential strategy to limit the costs of signaling is to
   only signal at maximum effort in contexts when signaling is expected to
   be most effective. Multiple studies have documented extensive plasticity
   in sexual signaling within a variety of contexts, however fewer
   experiments have examined individual-level variation in the extent of
   signaling plasticity and the causes of this variation. In this study we
   examined the influence of size and physical condition on the magnitude
   of signaling plasticity using a gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) study
   system. We quantified signaling plasticity by recording male calling
   behavior first in the absence and then in the presence of a sexually
   receptive female. For one call property, call length, we found that both
   weight and condition had a significant influence on the magnitude of
   plasticity. Smaller males, and males in higher condition exhibited the
   greatest degree of plasticity. We discuss several possible explanations
   for this pattern and provide suggestions for future work to examine the
   consequences of this plasticity and the potential interactive effects of
   multiple biotic and abiotic contexts on signaling plasticity. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Many birds have advanced their spring migration and breeding phenology
   in response to climate change, yet some long-distance migrants appear
   constrained in their adjustments. In addition, bird species with long
   generation times and those in higher trophic positions may also be less
   able to track climate-induced shifts in food availability. Migratory
   birds of prey may therefore be particularly vulnerable to climate change
   because: 1) most are long-lived and have relatively low reproductive
   capacity, 2) many feed predominately on insectivorous passerines, and 3)
   several undertake annual migrations totaling tens of thousands of
   kilometers. Using multi-decadal datasets for 14 raptor species observed
   at six sites across the Great Lakes region of North America, we detected
   phenological shifts in spring migration consistent with decadal climatic
   oscillations and global climate change. While the North Atlantic and El
   Nino Southern Oscillations exerted heterogeneous effects on the
   phenology of a few species, arrival dates more generally advanced by
   1.18 d per decade, a pattern consistent with the effects of global
   climate change. After accounting for heterogeneity across observation
   sites, five of the 10 most abundant species advanced the bulk of their
   spring migration phenology. Contrary to expectations, we found that
   long-distance migrants and birds with longer generation times tended to
   make the greatest advancements to their spring migration. Such results
   may indicate that phenotypic plasticity can facilitate climatic
   responses among these long-lived predators.}},

Abstract = {{Animals reduce their exposure to predation often at the cost of
   nutritional inputs. A variety of predator avoidance strategies exist,
   but species generally exist along a spectrum with some primarily
   utilizing behavioral responses to avoid predation and others relying
   more on morphological defenses to deter predation. North American
   porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) possess a well-developed predator
   deterrent strategy (i.e., quills). During the winter, porcupines enter a
   nutritional bottleneck where they principally rely on endogenous stores
   to survive winter. We hypothesized that porcupine behavior in winter
   would, then, be primarily driven by nutritional demands rather than
   predation risk. To test this trade-off between perceived risk of
   predation and nutritional stress, we analyzed the length and sinuosity
   of movement patterns, relative to nutritional condition (urinary urea:
   creatinine), snow conditions (depth, density), and a risk landscape
   (predation risk and refuges). As predicted, the sinuosity of movement
   paths was unrelated to any of our variables, but we detected a strong
   correlation between lengths of movements with risk landscape.
   Specifically, the length of porcupine movement declined as the average
   risk of predation increased, and the presence of refuge trees in their
   movement path was positively related to path length. Thus, even for
   animals possessing extreme morphological defenses effective at deterring
   predation, and during a period of nutritional stress, movement and
   behavior are nevertheless driven by perceived predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Food choice has profound implications for the relative intakes of water
   and salts, and thus for an animal's physiological state. Discrimination
   behaviors with respect salt intake have been documented in a number of
   vertebrate species, but few studies have considered the ecological
   context in which they occur. Here, we report on the results of a
   2-choice experiment designed to examine the influence of dietary salt
   content and freshwater availability in food discrimination behaviors in
   red knots Calidris canutus (Aves: Scolopacidae) that feed on mud snails
   Peringia ulvae (Gastropoda: Hydrobiidae) whose body fluids have either
   relatively low (25\%) or high (42\%) salinity. Birds ate more and spent
   longer time foraging on low-salinity mud snails when their salt gland
   sizes-an indicator of excretory capacity-were relatively small and when
   they were deprived of freshwater. However, as they enlarged salt
   glands-following a prolonged exposure to salty diet without access to
   freshwater-and regained access to freshwater, their preference for
   low-salinity prey disappeared. Such a change of preference illustrates
   the context dependency of discrimination. As the birds were able to
   maintain salt-water balance-inferred from plasma sodium
   concentration-under all conditions, changes in salinity preferences may
   occur without measurable physiological signs of osmotic stress. Our
   results highlight the importance of ecological context for understanding
   foraging responses. We argue that areas with high salinities could act
   as refuges for euryhaline invertebrates and fish from top vertebrate

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{617-627}},

Abstract = {{Parasites can increase their host's predation susceptibility. It is a
   long-standing puzzle, whether this is caused by host manipulation, an
   evolved strategy of the parasite, or by side effects due to, for
   example, the parasite consuming energy from its host thereby changing
   the host's trade-off between avoiding predation and foraging toward
   foraging. Here, we use sequential infection of three-spined sticklebacks
   with the cestode Schistocephalus solidus so that parasites have a
   conflict of interest over the direction of host manipulation. With true
   manipulation, the not yet infective parasite should reduce rather than
   enhance risk taking because predation would be fatal for its fitness; if
   host behavior is changed by a side effect, the 2 parasites would add
   their increase of predation risk because both drain energy. Our results
   support the latter hypothesis. In an additional experiment, we tested
   both infected and uninfected fish either starved or satiated. True host
   manipulation should act independently of the fish's hunger status and
   continue when energy drain is balanced through satiation. Starvation and
   satiation affect the risk averseness of infected sticklebacks similarly
   to that of uninfected starved and satiated ones. Increased energy drain
   rather than active host manipulation dominates behavioral changes of S.
   solidus-infected sticklebacks.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Sedentary time is an independent risk factor for chronic
   diseases and mortality. It is unknown whether active adults alter their
   dietary and/or physical activity behaviors in response to imposed
   sedentary time, possibly modifying risk, The aim of this study was to
   determine whether imposed sedentary time would alter typical behaviors

   randomized to the no-intervention control (CON, n = 8) group or the
   sedentary-intervention (SIT, n = 8) group. SIT participants attended
   monitored sedentary sessions (8 wk, 10 h/wk). Assessments including diet
   and physical activity occurred at baseline, week 4, and week 9. Results:
   There were no differences (P > .05) between CON and SIT groups for step
   counts or time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous physical
   activity when comparing a week during imposed sedentary time (week 4) to
   baseline and week 9. At week 4, caloric intake was not different from

   significantly (P > .05) in SIT from baseline to week 9. Conclusions:
   Active adults did not alter physical activity or dietary behaviors

Abstract = {{Generalist predators typically have broad diets, but their diets may

   predators exhibit stereotypic relationships with pulsed prey resources.
   We used telemetry data from 959 woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus

   (Canis latrans Say, 1823), and 55 black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas,

   caribou neonates on the island of Newfoundland. We examined the
   similarity of patterns of habitat use between caribou and their
   predators across time and related this similarity to interspecific
   spatiotemporal co-occurrence and mortality risk for caribou neonates.
   The similarity in habitat use between coyotes and caribou mirrored
   variation in juvenile hazard risk, but had weak association with actual
   co-occurrence with caribou. Bears and caribou exhibited less similarity
   in habitat use during the calving season than coyotes and caribou. The
   relationship between habitat use of bear and caribou did not correspond
   with either co-occurrence patterns or overall risk for caribou neonates.
   Our work illustrates how risk for a prey species can be shaped

Abstract = {{Copepod mating is a complex behavioral interplay between males and
   females. But successful mating also requires a physiological component
   in terms of eggand spermatophore production. In striking contrast to the
   extensive literature on copepod egg production, costs of spermatophore
   production has largely been ignored. This article explores the energetic
   demands in male copepod reproduction, testing how food and predation
   risk influence spermatophore production. Moreover, we analyse swimming
   behavior to test if predation risk and food act on reproductive
   investments via behavioral responses. We found that spermatophore
   production depends strongly on food availability. The copepods increased
   grazing rates with predation risk when food was limited, and video
   analyses revealed that males spend less time swimming in presence of a
   risk cue. A review of the few available spermatophore production rates
   suggests that food limits spermatophore production for copepods at
   large. Apparently, potential encounter rates with mates or predators did
   not influence spermatophore production. However, the reduced activity
   indicates a trade-off between risk avoidance and mate encounter,
   potentially influencing mating rates. This study shows that males invest
   considerable resources in each spermatophore, with implications for
   mating strategies and population dynamics in copepods, the most abundant
   metazoans on earth.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits is increasingly a
   focus for animal researchers, for which fish have become important
   models. Almost all of this work has been done in the context of
   evolutionary ecology, with few explicit attempts to apply repeatability
   and context dependency of trait variation toward understanding
   conservation-related issues. Here, we review work examining the degree
   to which repeatability of traits (such as boldness, swimming
   performance, metabolic rate and stress responsiveness) is context
   dependent. We review methods for quantifying repeatability
   (distinguishing between within-context and across-context repeatability)
   and confounding factors that may be especially problematic when
   attempting to measure repeatability in wild fish. Environmental factors
   such temperature, food availability, oxygen availability, hypercapnia,
   flow regime and pollutants all appear to alter trait repeatability in
   fishes. This suggests that anthropogenic environmental change could
   alter evolutionary trajectories by changing which individuals achieve
   the greatest fitness in a given set of conditions. Gaining a greater
   understanding of these effects will be crucial for our ability to
   forecast the effects of gradual environmental change, such as climate
   change and ocean acidification, the study of which is currently limited
   by our ability to examine trait changes over relatively short time
   scales. Also discussed are situations in which recent advances in
   technologies associated with electronic tags (biotelemetry and
   biologging) and respirometry will help to facilitate increased
   quantification of repeatability for physiological and integrative

Abstract = {{Maternal nutritional status (MNS) is a strong predictor of growth and
   development in the first 1000 days of life and may influence
   susceptibility to non-communicable diseases in adulthood. However, the
   role of nutrition during this window of developmental plasticity in
   Africa is unclear. This paper reviews published data to address whether
   maternal nutrition during the first 1000 days is important for Africa,
   with a focus on MNS and its associations with fetal growth and birth,
   neonatal and infant outcomes. A systematic approach was used to search
   the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google
   Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciSearch and Cochrane Library. In all, 26
   studies met the inclusion criteria for the specific objectives. MNS in
   Africa showed features typical of the epidemiological transition: higher
   prevalences of maternal overweight and obesity and lower underweight,
   poor diet quality 1 and high anaemia prevalence. Maternal body mass
   index and greater gestational weight gain (GWG) were positively
   associated with birth weight; however, maternal overweight and obesity
   were associated with increased risk of macrosomia and intrauterine
   growth restriction. Maternal anaemia was associated with lower birth
   weight. Macro- and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy were
   associated with improvements in GWG, birth weight and mortality risk.
   Data suggest poor MNS in Africa and confirms the importance of the first
   1000 days as a critical period for nutritional intervention to improve
   growth, birth outcomes and potential future health risk. However, there
   is a lack of data beyond birth and a need for longitudinal data through
   infancy to 2 years of age.}},

   arose from a primary host. Fecundity varied significantly among hosts
   and was highest on a novel host. Hosts did not differ significantly in
   free amino acids (FAAs) but did differ in concentrations of essential
   amino acids (EAAs). However, nymphs did not differ significantly in
   EAAs. Surprisingly, fecundity was not related to total FAAs,
   availability of EAAs or concentrations of EAAs but was related to
   concentrations of four non-EAAs. Mean fecundity per host was also
   positively related to the relative abundance of galloyl groups

   habitat occupied, in terms of the types of land use, waterbody, and bank
   vegetation. Secondly, we tested whether the choice of method of
   presenting prey percentages in the diet of otters influenced the
   conclusions of the meta-analysis. The percentage of fish in the diet was
   greater for otters occupying standing water than for those occupying
   flowing water; was higher for otters in waterbodies overgrown by reed
   vegetation; and varied depending on the type of surrounding land use.
   However, the results of the meta-analysis varied depending on which of
   the two most common methods of diet analysis were used: percentage
   biomass or relative frequency of occurrence (RFO). We showed that the
   plasticity of otter feeding behaviour might be explained by the various
   habitats occupied by otters. Habitat differences reflected in otters'
   diets might have importance for the maintenance and conservation of
   local populations of this species. The high diversity of methods used by
   researchers to report the results of dietary studies precludes full
   comparisons and synthesis. This demonstrates the importance of
   unification of reporting. Moreover, the conclusions reached by the
   authors of any particular study might be highly dependent on the method
   they applied. Thus, care should be taken when comparing ecological
   studies based on different methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the prevalence and incidence of
   traditional eating disorders (EDs, e.g., anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia
   nervosa and binge eating disorder (BED)) in individuals with childhood
   onset neuropsychiatric disorders, including
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). The aim of the present study was to examine the
   prevalence of EDs and eating pathology in young adults and adults with
   ADHD and/or ASD, and to investigate the relationship between EDs and
   associated symptoms, on the one hand, and other psychiatric disorders,
   intelligence, and BMI, on the other hand, in this population.
   Methods: In an outpatient setting, 228 consecutively referred adults
   were neuropsychiatrically evaluated and assessed with regard to
   intelligence (WAIS-III), psychiatric comorbidities (SCID-I), personality
   disorders (SCID-II), eating disorders (SCID-I) and eating pathology
   (Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)).
   Results: For the entire sample, a total of 18 individuals (7.9\%) had a
   current or previous eating disorder, with AN and BED being the most
   frequent. The male:female ratio was 1:2.5. According to EAT, 10.1\% of
   the individuals scored within the range of severely disturbed eating
   behavior, and 13\% moderately disturbed eating behavior. Individuals
   with ADHD more often affirmed eating pathology such as focusing on
   thoughts of calories and body dissatisfaction compared to individuals
   with ASD.
   Conclusions: Eating disorder symptomatology seems to be overrepresented
   in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders compared with the general
   population. The gender ratio for EDs in adults with neuropsychiatric
   disorders is not nearly as skewed as in the general population. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The study of primates living in novel environments represents an
   interesting context in which to examine patterns of behavioral and
   ecological flexibility. Our research focused on an understudied,
   anthropogenically introduced primate population living in Florida, USA:
   the Silver River rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). To better understand
   how this population has adapted to life in Florida's riparian woodlands,
   we collected data on the diet and size of the rhesus macaque population
   and its encounters with boaters along the Silver River from January to
   May 2013. Using scan sampling and all-occurrences sampling, we collected
   166 h of diet data and 105 h of human-macaque encounter data,
   respectively. We confirmed previous reports that four social groups
   comprise the Silver River macaque population, totaling 118 individuals.
   The Silver River macaques predominantly consumed leaves and other
   vegetative plant parts (87.5 \%), with ash trees serving as a staple
   food (66.5 \% of feeding records). Although human-macaque encounters
   were frequent (80 \% of 611 boats observed), only a small proportion of
   boats (11.5 \%) provisioned the macaques. Motorized boats (e.g., pontoon
   and motor boats) were more likely to provision, while kayaks and canoes
   were more likely to move in close proximity of the macaques situated at
   the river's edge. Our results indicate that the Silver River macaques
   have adjusted to life in the New World by adopting a temperate-dwelling
   feeding strategy and by incorporating locally available foods (e.g.,
   sedges) into their diet. They have also learned that the river's edge
   provides opportunities to receive provisions from boaters. However,
   because the rate of provisioning is low, these foods likely play a
   filler fallback role. Given that provisioning and direct contact between
   macaques and boaters are infrequent but proximity to the macaques is a
   concern, our findings have important implications for the management of
   the human-macaque interface along the Silver River and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, the nontrivial cost of ejaculate production has led
   males to evolve prudent reproductive strategies in the form of
   precopulatory mating bias and/or cryptic ejaculate allocation.
   Behaviours determining male reproductive success, such as courtship and
   aggression, also impose substantial costs potentially selecting for
   plasticity in these traits. Here, using laboratory-adapted populations
   of Drosophila melanogaster, we investigated whether males show
   plasticity in these behaviours in response to the changes in their
   perception of future risk of competition (generated by varying the
   number of rivals). We show that males exhibited nonlinear plasticity in
   their aggressive behaviour. Males subjected to intermediate risk were
   found to show the maximum level of aggression compared to those
   subjected to low and high risk. Such plasticity in aggression did not
   lead to any variation in mating success but significantly increased the
   cost of reproduction. We also found a similar trend in courtship
   behaviour. While our results on copulation duration confirmed the
   previously reported plasticity, we did not find any effect of the
   treatment on mating latency. To the best of our knowledge this is the
   first empirical evidence showing plasticity in aggression in response to
   perceived risk of future competition and its relation to the cost of

Abstract = {{Rates of innovative foraging behaviours and success on problem-solving
   tasks are often used to assay differences in cognition, both within and
   across species. Yet the cognitive features of some problem-solving tasks
   can be unclear. As such, explanations that attribute cognitive
   mechanisms to individual variation in problem-solving performance have
   revealed conflicting results. We investigated individual consistency in
   problem-solving performances in captive-reared pheasant chicks,
   Phasianus colchicus, and addressed whether success depends on cognitive
   processes, such as trial-and-error associative learning, or whether
   performances may be driven solely via noncognitive motivational
   mechanisms, revealed through subjects' willingness to approach, engage
   with and persist in their interactions with an apparatus, or via
   physiological traits such as body condition. While subjects'
   participation and success were consistent within the same problems and
   across similar tasks, their performances were inconsistent across
   different types of task. Moreover, subjects' latencies to approach each
   test apparatus and their attempts to access the reward were not
   repeatable across trials. Successful individuals did not improve their
   performances with experience, nor were they consistent in their
   techniques in repeated presentations of a task. However, individuals
   that were highly motivated to enter the experimental chamber were more
   likely to participate. Successful individuals were also faster to
   approach each test apparatus and more persistent in their attempts to
   solve the tasks than unsuccessful individuals. Our findings therefore
   suggest that individual differences in problem-solving success can arise

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{231-239}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The rate at which infants develop can vary within species. This
   variation may be due to differences between infants in their nutritional
   intake and physiology, or the ability of females to adjust the amount
   and timing of maternal investment to maximize their lifetime
   reproductive success. This is the first primate study that uses a large
   sample size and multivariate analyses to investigate whether variation
   in early infant development (measured visually using durations of natal
   coat stages) is explained by differences in infanticide pressure,
   predation pressure or feeding competition among mothers. We recorded the
   number of days that infants took to transition through each of the two
   natal coat stages (white to grey: N = 32; grey to black-and-white: N =
   22), as well as through their entire natal coats (white to
   black-and-white: N = 38) in a population of wild ursine colobus, Colobus
   vellerosus. Infant males, which are at greater risk of infanticidal
   attacks, transitioned coat colours earlier than females, and infants in
   multimale groups, where infanticide occurs more frequently, transitioned
   earlier than infants in unimale groups. Variation in group size did not
   affect natal coat durations, which suggests that the intensity of
   predation risk and feeding competition do not influence development.
   Instead of terminating investment in offspring before birth, as in the
   `Bruce effect', females may invest more heavily in infants after birth
   in order to speed up infant development and reduce the time period
   during which offspring are the most vulnerable to infanticide. Mothers
   may therefore have flexible means of exerting choice over maternal
   investment in relation to infanticide risk. However, the extent to which
   mothers and infants are responsible for adjusting the speed of
   development is unknown. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Appetitive traits and general temperament traits
   have both been correlated with adiposity and obesity in children.
   However, very few studies have tested structural models to identify the
   links between temperament, appetitive traits and adiposity in children.
   A validated structural model would help suggesting mechanisms to explain
   the impact of temperament on body mass index (BMI). In this study, we
   used Rothbart's heuristic definition of temperament as a starting point
   to define four appetitive traits, including two appetite reactivity
   dimensions (Appetite Arousal and Appetite Persistence) and two
   dimensions of self-regulation in eating (Self-regulation In Eating
   Without Hunger and Self-regulation in Eating Speed). We conducted a
   cross-sectional study in young adolescents to validate a structural
   model including these four appetitive traits, Effortful Control (a
   general temperament trait) and adiposity.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: A questionnaire assessing the four appetitive trait
   dimensions and Effortful Control was completed by adolescents from 10 to
   14 years old (n = 475), and their BMI-for-age was calculated (n = 441).
   In total, 74\% of the study participants were normal weight, 26\% were
   overweight and 8\% were obese. We then used structural equation
   modelling to test the structural model.
   RESULTS: We identified a well-fitting structural model (Comparative Fit
   Index = 0.91; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.04) that
   supports the hypothesis that Effortful Control impacts both dimensions
   of self-regulation in eating, which in turn are linked with both
   appetite reactivity dimensions. Moreover, Appetite Persistence is the
   only appetitive trait that was significantly related to adiposity (B =
   0.12; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that Effortful Control is related to
   adiposity through the mediation of an individual's `eating temperament'
   (appetite reactivity and self-regulation in eating). Results suggest
   that young adolescents who exhibit high appetite reactivity but a low
   level of self-regulation in eating are at higher risk for excess
   adiposity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite many advances in management and housing of dairy calves, 1 in 10
   US dairy heifers die before weaning. A better understanding of the
   internal and external stimuli that contribute to the physiological and
   behavioral responses of calves to stressors is needed to reduce the risk
   of morbidity and mortality. Feeding calves their first meal is crucial,
   as successful passive transfer reduces the risk of mortality and
   morbidity. Sexually dimorphic immune and stress responses appear to be
   present in young cattle, but more research is needed to determine if
   this is caused by human bias for female calves. After that first
   feeding, 1 in 10 heifers and most bull calves in the United States are
   transported to specialized calf-raising facilities, yet information is
   lacking on the newborn calf stress response during transit. Whether
   calves are raised on site or at a calf ranch, individual housing systems
   are commonly used in the United States to reduce the risk of pathogen
   exposure and provide individual feeding and health-care. However,
   health, growth, and social implications may be present for calves in
   alternative systems with greater space allowance than conventional
   systems or group housing. Disbudding and castration are typically
   performed at an early age for dairy calves during the pre-wean stage.
   These stressors often take place when the calf has decreased passive
   transfer of Ig and immunity is developing. Availability of pain
   mitigation through anesthetics and analgesics is limited, but evidence
   indicates that analgesics attenuate suppressed leukocyte function during
   these procedures. Solid-feed intake is a primary measure for determining
   weaning readiness, but some milk replacer formulas may influence the
   calf's oral behaviors before weaning; therefore, alternate weaning
   methods may need to coincide with alternate milk replacer, formulas. The
   calf's behavioral and stress response at weaning may influence its
   immunity during the transition from individual to group housing
   (commingling). Alternate commingling strategies and nutritional
   supplements may help with this transition, but more research is needed
   to explore feasible alternatives. Optimizing the calf's health and
   well-being at these early stages may improve its long-term health and
   welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Responsive feeding has been identified as important in preventing
   overconsumption by infants. However, this is predicated on an assumption
   that parents recognise and respond to infant feeding cues. Despite this,
   relatively little is understood about how infants engage parental
   feeding responses. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to
   identify what is known about infant communication of hunger and
   satiation and what issues impact on the expression and perception of
   these states. A search of Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO,
   Science Direct and Maternal and Infant care produced 27 papers.
   Eligibility criteria included peer reviewed qualitative and/or
   quantitative publications on feeding behaviours, hunger, and
   satiation/satiety cues of typically developing children in the first
   2years of life. Papers published between 1966 and 2013 were included in
   the review. The review revealed that feeding cues and behaviours are
   shaped by numerous issues, such as infants' physical attributes,
   individual psychological factors and environmental factors. Meanwhile,
   infant characteristics, external cues and mothers' own characteristics
   affect how feeding cues are perceived. The existing literature provides
   insights into many aspects of hunger and satiation in infancy; however,
   there are significant gaps in our knowledge. There is a lack of
   validated tools for measuring hunger and satiation, a need to understand
   how different infant characteristics impact on feeding behaviour and a
   need to extricate the respective contributions of infant and maternal
   characteristics to perceptions of hunger and satiation. Further research
   is also recommended to differentiate between feeding driven by liking
   and that driven by hunger.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the broad diet range of many predatory ladybirds,
   the mechanisms involved in their adaptation to diet shifts are not
   completely understood. Here, we explored how a primarily coccidophagous
   ladybird Cryptolaemus montrouzieri adapts to feeding on aphids.
   Results: Based on the lower survival rate, longer developmental time,
   and lower adult body weight and reproduction rate of the predator, the
   aphid Megoura japonica proved being less suitable to support C.
   montrouzieri as compared with the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri. The
   results indicated up-regulation of genes related to ribosome and
   translation in fourth instars, which may be related to their suboptimal
   development. Also, several genes related to biochemical transport and
   metabolism, and detoxification were up-regulated as a result of
   adaptation to the changes in nutritional and non-nutritional (toxic)
   components of the prey.
   Conclusion: Our results indicated that C. montrouzieri succeeded in
   feeding on aphids by regulation of genes related to development,
   digestion and detoxification. Thus, we argue that these candidate genes
   are valuable for further studies of the functional evolution of
   ladybirds led by diet shifts.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the mechanistic basis and wider implications of adopting a
   developmental perspective on human ageing. Previous models of ageing
   have concentrated on its genetic basis, or the detrimental effects of
   accumulated damage, but also have raised issues about whether ageing can
   be viewed as adaptive itself, or is a consequence of other adaptive
   processes, for example if maintenance and repair processes in the period
   up to reproduction are traded off against later decline in function. A
   life course model places ageing in the context of the attainment of peak
   capacity for a body system, starting in early development when
   plasticity permits changes in structure and function induced by a range
   of environmental stimuli, followed by a period of decline, the rate of
   which depends on the peak attained as well as the later life conditions.
   Such path dependency in the rate of ageing may offer new insights into
   its modification. Focusing on musculoskeletal and cardiovascular
   function, we discuss this model and the possible underlying mechanisms,
   including endothelial function, oxidative stress, stem cells and
   nutritional factors such as vitamin D status. Epigenetic changes induced
   during developmental plasticity, and immune function may provide a
   common mechanistic process underlying a life course model of ageing. The
   life course trajectory differs in high and low resource settings. New
   insights into the developmental components of the life course model of
   ageing may lead to the design of biomarkers of later chronic disease
   risk and to new interventions to promote healthy ageing, with important
   implications for public health.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of host attributes for the likelihood of
   associated microbial transmission, individual variation is seldom
   considered in studies of wildlife disease. Here, we test the influence
   of host phenotypes on social network structure and the likelihood of
   cuticular bacterial transmission from exposed individuals to susceptible
   group-mates using female social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola). Based on
   the interactions of resting individuals of known behavioural types, we
   assessed whether individuals assorted according to their behavioural
   traits. We found that individuals preferentially interacted with
   individuals of unlike behavioural phenotypes. We next applied a green
   fluorescent protein-transformed cuticular bacterium, Pantoea sp., to
   individuals and allowed them to interact with an unexposed colonymate
   for 24 h. We found evidence for transmission of bacteria in 55\% of
   cases. The likelihood of transmission was influenced jointly by the
   behavioural phenotypes of both the exposed and susceptible individuals:
   transmission was more likely when exposed spiders exhibited higher
   `boldness' relative to their colony-mate, and when unexposed individuals
   were in better body condition. Indirect transmission via shared silk
   took place in only 15\% of cases. Thus, bodily contact appears key to
   transmission in this system. These data represent a fundamental step
   towards understanding how individual traits influence larger-scale
   social and epidemiological dynamics.}},

   various potentially fitness linked - male traits in Carpetan rock

   (Haemogregarinidae) infection and risk-taking: lizards with higher
   infection intensity took more risk. While we cannot distinguish cause
   from causative in the parasite intensity - risk-taking correlation our
   results are in line with the asset protection hypothesis predicting that

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{In the face of starvation, animals will engage in high-risk behaviors
   that would normally be considered maladaptive. Starving rodents, for
   example, will forage in areas that are more susceptible to predators and
   will also modulate aggressive behavior within a territory of limited or
   depleted nutrients. The neural basis of these adaptive behaviors likely
   involves circuits that link innate feeding, aggression and fear.
   Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are
   critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain
   regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping
   techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a
   subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the
   amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,
   which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear. We
   propose that AgRP neurons serve as a master switch capable of

Abstract = {{Obesity is a persistent and pervasive problem, particularly in
   industrialized nations. It has come to be appreciated that the metabolic
   health of an individual can influence brain function and subsequent
   behavioral patterns. To examine the relationship between metabolic
   phenotype and central systems that regulate behavior, we tested rats
   with divergent metabolic phenotypes (Low Capacity Runner: LCR vs. High
   Capacity Runner: HCR) for behavioral responses to the conflict between
   hunger and environmental novelty using the novelty suppressed feeding
   (NSF) paradigm. Additionally, we measured expression of mRNA, for
   peptides involved in energy management, in response to fasting.
   Following a 24-h fast, LCR rats showed lower latencies to begin eating
   in a novel environment compared to HCR rats. A 48-h fast equilibrated
   the latency to begin eating in the novel environment. A 24-h fast
   differentially affected expression of cocaine-amphetamine regulated
   transcript (CART) mRNA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), where 24-h of
   fasting reduced CART mRNA in LCR rats. Bilateral microinjections of CART
   55-102 peptide into the NAc increased the latency to begin eating in the
   NSF paradigm following a 24-h fast in LCR rats. These results indicate
   that metabolic phenotype influences how animals cope with the conflict
   between hunger and novelty, and that these differences are at least
   partially mediated by CART signaling in the NAc. For individuals with
   poor metabolic health who have to navigate food-rich and stressful
   environments, changes in central systems that mediate conflicting drives
   may feed into the rates of obesity and exacerbate the difficulty
   individuals have in maintaining weight loss. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Development is a continuous process during which individuals gain
   information about their environment and adjust their phenotype
   accordingly. In many natural systems, individuals are particularly
   sensitive to early life experiences, even in the absence of later
   constraints on plasticity. Recent models have highlighted how the
   adaptive use of information can explain age-dependent plasticity. These
   models assume that information gain and phenotypic adjustments either
   cannot occur simultaneously or are completely independent. This
   assumption is not valid in the context of growth, where finding food
   results both in a size increase and learning about food availability.
   Here, we describe a simple model of growth to provide proof of principle
   that long-term effects of early life experiences can arise through the
   coupled dynamics of information acquisition and phenotypic change in the
   absence of direct constraints on plasticity. The increase in
   reproductive value from gaining information and sensitivity of behavior
   to experiences declines across development. Early life experiences have
   long-term impacts on age of maturity, yet-due to compensatory changes in
   behavior-our model predicts no substantial effects on reproductive
   success. We discuss how the evolution of sensitive windows can be
   explained by experiences having short-term effects on informational and
   phenotypic states, which generate long-term effects on life-history
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat selection is a complex process, which involves behavioural
   decisions guided by the multiple needs and constraints faced by
   individuals. Climate-induced changes in environmental conditions may
   alter those trade-offs and resulting habitat use patterns.
   2. In this study, we investigated the effect of sea temperature on
   habitat selection and habitat use of acoustically tagged Atlantic cod
   (Gadus morhua) at the Norwegian Skagerrak coast.
   3. Significant relationships between ocean temperature and habitat
   selection and use were found. Under favourable sea temperature
   thresholds (< 16 degrees C), cod selected vegetated habitats, such as
   eelgrass and macroalgae beds, available in shallow areas. Selection for
   those habitats was especially high at night, when cod tended to ascend
   to shallower areas, presumably to feed. Selection and use of those
   habitats decreased significantly as temperature rose. Under increased
   sea surface temperature conditions, cod were absent from vegetated
   shallow habitats, both during the day and night, and selected instead
   non-vegetated rocky bottoms and sand habitats, available in deeper,
   colder areas.
   4. This study shows the dynamic nature of habitat selection and strongly
   suggests that cod in this region have to trade off food availability
   against favourable temperature conditions. Future increases in ocean
   temperature are expected to further influence the spatial behaviour of
   marine fish, potentially affecting individual fitness and population
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological advances and trophic mismatches are frequently reported
   ecological consequences of climate warming. Trophic mismatches occur
   when phenological responses to environmental conditions differ among
   trophic levels such that the timing of resource demand by consumers
   becomes decoupled from supply. We used 25 years of demographic
   measurements of a migratory songbird (the black-throated blue warbler
   Setophaga caerulescens) to compare its breeding phenology to the
   phenology of both its caterpillar prey and the foliage on which
   caterpillars feed. Caterpillar biomass in this forest did not show a
   predictable seasonal pulse. Nest initiation by warblers in this northern
   hardwood forest was therefore not timed to coincide with a peak in food
   availability for nestlings. Nonetheless, timing of first clutches was
   strongly associated with spring leaf expansion (slope +/- SE = 0.56 +/-
   0.08 days per day of change in leaf phenology, R-2 = 0.66). Warblers
   adjusted the timing of breeding to early springs mainly by shortening
   the interval between arrival and clutch initiation, but this likely has
   limits because recent early springs are approaching the relatively
   inflexible dates when birds arrive on the breeding grounds. Although the
   timing of first nests did not match 1:1 with leaf-out phenology, the
   adjustments in breeding time maximized mean annual reproductive success.
   Nest predation had the greatest effect on annual reproductive success,
   but the ability of nesting warblers to appropriately track leaf
   phenology accounted for effects on annual reproductive success
   comparable to the influence of variation in caterpillar abundance and
   conspecific density. Nesting phenology in black-throated blue warblers
   was generally well matched to the timing of leaf-out, even though the
   match was not 1:1. Without measurements of reproductive success, these
   unequal phenological shifts might otherwise have been interpreted as
   having negative ecological consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The ways in which animal societies respond to threat has enormous
   consequences for their success. In the present study, we investigated
   how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus
   dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how
   their responses change with experience with important predators,
   Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a
   mixture of `bold' and `shy' personality types exhibited twice as much
   defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony
   defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience
   with predators for `mixed' colonies than for either monotypic
   composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals
   were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus,
   colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to
   experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally
   observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to
   determine which individual traits were associated with task
   participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology
   and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level,
   with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the
   attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making.
   Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting
   participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between
   colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence
   that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in
   situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively
   associated with colony persistence during attacks. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to
   different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether
   these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare.
   Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive
   success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the
   exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests
   and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour
   (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness
   were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal
   component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the
   females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in
   two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014
   we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our
   results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected
   by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which
   may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female
   reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was
   only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at
   the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was
   additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food
   availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and
   explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We
   conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of
   the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive
   impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food
   availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of
   personality on reproductive success differed between changing
   environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that
   different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by
   varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Individuals within groups benefit when they are phenotypically and
   behaviourally similar. Despite this, mixed-species aggregations are
   found among a wide range of animal taxa and are known to provide
   advantages in terms of enhanced foraging efficiency and predator
   avoidance. However, little is known about individual level interactions
   within these groups or the mechanisms mediating their structure.
   Diet-derived chemical cues can mediate within-species associations in
   fish, but it is not known whether they serve a similar function across
   species. To investigate this, we created mixed-species groups of
   sympatric three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and nine-spined
   (Pungitius pungitius) sticklebacks and manipulated the diet of the
   constituent group members. We found that three-spined sticklebacks did
   not associate more frequently with conspecifics over heterospecifics
   when all animals received the same diet, suggesting that
   species-specific cues did not influence association patterns. However,
   when group members were fed different diets, they interacted with
   heterospecifics fed on the same diet more than with conspecifics from a
   different diet treatment. This study demonstrates the importance of
   chemical cues as a possible mechanism for establishing familiarity, and
   thereby mediating within-group structure even between individuals in
   mixed-species aggregations. Understanding these underlying mechanisms
   has significant implications for our understanding of other social
   dynamics, including social learning and information transfer.
   Mixed-species groupings are common among animals, although we have a
   poor understanding of how these groups are structured, what mediates
   interactions between group members, and what the function of such groups
   is. In a study using two co-occurring stickleback species, we show that
   fish preferred to associate with shoal members fed the same diet as
   themselves, irrespective of their species. This is most likely mediated
   by diet-derived chemical cues and may allow fish to avoid detection by
   predators or forage alongside individuals with similar dietary
   preferences. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning non-random
   associations in mixed-species groups has significant implications for
   our understanding of other social dynamics, including social learning
   and information transfer.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesize that anorexia nervosa (AN) poses a physiological stress.
   Therefore, the way an individual copes with stress may affect AN
   vulnerability. Since prenatal stress (PNS) exposure alters stress
   responsivity in offspring this may increase their risk of developing AN.
   We tested this hypothesis using the activity based anorexia (ABA) rat
   model in control and PNS rats that were characterized by either
   proactive or passive stress-coping behavior.
   We found that PNS passively coping rats ate less and lost more weight
   during the ABA paradigm. Exposure to ABA resulted in higher baseline
   corticosterone and lower insulin levels in all groups. However, leptin
   levels were only decreased in rats with a proactive stress-coping style.
   Similarly, ghrelin levels were increased only in proactively coping ABA
   rats. Neuropeptide Y (Npy) expression was increased and
   proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) expression was decreased in all rats exposed
   to ABA. In contrast, agouti related peptide (Agrp) and orexin (Hctr)
   expression were increased in all but the PNS passively coping ABA rats.
   Furthermore, DNA methylation of the orexin gene was increased after ABA
   in proactive coping rats and not in passive coping rats.
   Overall our study suggests that passive PNS rats have innate impairments
   in leptin and ghrelin in responses to starvation combined with prenatal
   stress associated impairments in Agrp and orexin expression in response
   to starvation. These impairments may underlie decreased food intake and
   associated heightened body weight loss during ABA in the passively
   coping PNS rats. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Human milk oligosaccharides have been proposed to exert beneficial
   effects on brain development. During the last decades, most of the
   studies have focused on the evaluation of sialylated structures but
   recent experiments have also tested fucosylated oligosaccharides, i.e.
   2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL). The present study aimed to determine whether
   oral 2'-FL has an effect on the development of newborn brain,
   contributing to enhance cognitive skills later in life. Rat pups
   received an oral supplementation of 2'-FL (2'-FL group) or water
   (control group) during the lactation period. Thereafter, animals were
   maintained on a rodent standard diet. Rats (n = 12 rats/group) were
   evaluated twice, at age 4-6 weeks and again at age 1 year, using
   classical behavioral tests. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) was
   also performed at the same ages (n = 10 rats/group). Both groups showed
   similar behavior when the animals were assessed just after weaning (age
   4-6 weeks), although the 2'-FL group seemed to perform slightly better
   in Morris Water Maze. At age 1 year, 2'-FL rats performed significantly
   better in the Novel Object Recognition and Y maze paradigms, when
   compared to controls. In addition, LTP was more intense and longer
   lasting in the rats supplemented with 2'-FL than in control animals,
   both in young and adult animals. Oral administration of 2'-FL
   exclusively during lactation enhanced cognitive abilities, not only in
   childhood but also in adulthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{215-222}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Human activities can impact animal communities by altering species
   interactions. The influence of forest harvesting on the interaction
   between threatened boreal caribou, moose, and wolves constitutes a
   classic example. When conifer forests are logged, clear-cuts are
   colonized by deciduous vegetation that provides high-quality food for
   moose. Subsequent changes in wolf distribution alter predation risk for
   caribou. Given that primary productivity varies along latitudinal
   gradients, the effects of logging on moose-caribou-wolf interactions
   could also vary moving northwards. Empirical evidence, however, is
   lacking and current recommendations for caribou conservation are fixed
   over space. We assessed whether the impact of logging activities on
   caribou-moose-wolf interactions varies with latitude. We estimated
   deciduous vegetation availability from satellite imagery, and followed
   all three species with GPS collars to evaluate their habitat selection.
   We found that the availability of deciduous vegetation in logged stands
   decreased along a 400-km latitudinal gradient. The probability of
   caribou occurrence remained low in clear-cuts, regardless of deciduous
   vegetation availability. Moose and wolves increased their selection for
   clear-cuts as they contained more deciduous vegetation. Accordingly, the
   relative co-occurrence probability of moose and wolves was strongly
   associated with clear-cuts at low latitudes, but weakly so at high
   latitudes. Clear-cuts should therefore attract moose and wolves more
   strongly to prime boreal caribou habitat at lower latitudes, and caribou
   predation risk should follow similar geographical patterns. Conservation
   planning should account for geographical patterns in the risk faced by
   threatened populations because the effectiveness of strategies developed
   from average patterns can decrease over space, in consistent manner. (C)

Abstract = {{Controlling dyslipidemia is important for the prevention and treatment
   of cardiovascular diseases. This review introduces dietary management
   recommendations from the 2015 Korean Guidelines for the Management of
   Dyslipidemia, which were established by the Korean Society of Lipidology
   and Atherosclerosis. To prevent dyslipidemia, controlling dietary energy
   consumption to maintain a healthy body weight is important, due to the
   positive relationship among overweight, obesity, and dyslipidemia. It is
   recommended that less than 30\% of total daily calories come from
   dietary fat. Rather than simply decreasing the consumption of total fat,
   it is suggested that the consumption of saturated and trans fatty acid
   is less than 7\% and 1\%, respectively, of total daily calories. To
   reduce serum total triglycerides, the consumption of dietary
   carbohydrates is advised not to take excessive, and in particular a
   reduction in the consumption of simple sugars. The consumption of
   dietary fiber, which is rich in foods such as whole grains and
   vegetables, is recommended at 25 grams per day. Also, based on studies
   on the relationship between disease and dietary patterns, it is advised
   to maintain a diverse and balanced diet that includes vegetables,
   fruits, dairy products and whole grains, rather than a diet consisting
   of meat, noodles, and alcohol. Focusing on lifestyle behavioral
   strategies that target diet management to improve dyslipidemia could be
   highly effective in facilitating the risk reduction of cardiovascular
   disease and enhancing pharmacotherapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Analysing population genomic data from killer whale ecotypes, which we
   estimate have globally radiated within less than 250,000 years, we show
   that genetic structuring including the segregation of potentially
   functional alleles is associated with socially inherited ecological
   niche. Reconstruction of ancestral demographic history revealed
   bottlenecks during founder events, likely promoting ecological
   divergence and genetic drift resulting in a wide range of genome-wide
   differentiation between pairs of allopatric and sympatric ecotypes.
   Functional enrichment analyses provided evidence for regional genomic
   divergence associated with habitat, dietary preferences and post-zygotic
   reproductive isolation. Our findings are consistent with expansion of
   small founder groups into novel niches by an initial plastic behavioural
   response, perpetuated by social learning imposing an altered natural

Abstract = {{Although drinking problems are now well documented in adolescents and
   young people, few data are available on alcohol use in children younger
   than 12. In France, studies have shown that 60-70\% of I 1-year-olds
   reported having tasted alcohol drinks, 4-7\% having experienced
   drunkenness at least once, and that 5-8\% might be regarded as
   ``regular{''} alcohol users. By comparison, the prevalence of child
   drinking in the United States seems to be lower. All studies show that
   parental alcohol-specific attitudes and parental educational practices
   have a strong influence on the initiation of alcohol use in children.
   Some of them also indicate that early-onset drinking in children may be
   related to psychosocial functioning in other life areas, such as problem
   behaviors, low school engagement, and poor relationships with parents,
   in association with temperamental and environmental risk factors similar
   to those described in substance use disorders. Since epidemiological
   studies showed that early initiation of alcohol use is linked to later
   alcohol-related problems, these data call for further attention to

Abstract = {{Dispersing and non-dispersing individuals often differ in phenotypic

   We experimentally tested whether differences in nest-defence behaviour
   between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals changed with local
   habitat quality in collared flycatchers, by providing additional food
   during the nestling rearing period. In control (non-food-supplemented)
   nests, dispersers were less prone to defend their brood compared with
   non-dispersers, whereas in food-supplemented nests, dispersing and

   discuss the importance of dispersal costs versus adaptive flexibility in
   reproductive investment in shaping these differences in nest-defence
   behaviour between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals.
   Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, our study emphasizes the

Abstract = {{Soft sediments in coastal shallow waters constitute nursery habitats for
   juveniles of several flatfishes. The quality of a nursery is defined by
   its capacity to optimize the growth and the survival of juvenile fish.
   The influence of biotic factors, such as food availability, is poorly
   studied at the scale of a nursery ground. Whether food availability
   limits juvenile survival is still uncertain. A spatial approach is used
   to understand the influence of food availability on the distribution of
   juvenile fish of various benthic and demersal species in the Bay of
   Vilaine (France), a productive nursery ground. We quantified the spatial
   overlap between benthic macro-invertebrates and their predators
   (juvenile fish) to assess if the latter were spatially covering the most
   productive areas of the Bay. Three scenarios describing the shapes of
   the predator prey spatial relationship were tested to quantify the
   strength of the relationship and consequently the importance of food
   availability in determining fish distribution. Our results underline
   that both.food availability and fish densities vary greatly over the
   nursery ground. When considering small organisational levels (e.g., a
   single fish species), the predator prey spatial relationship was not
   dear, likely because of additional environmental effects not identified
   here; but at larger organisational level (the whole juvenile fish
   community), a strong overlap between the fish predators and their prey
   was identified. The evidence that fish concentrate in sectors with high
   food availability suggests that either food is the limiting factor in
   that nursery or/and fish display behavioural responses by optimising
   their energetic expenditures associated with foraging. Further
   investigations are needed to test the two hypotheses and to assess the
   impact of benthic and demersal juvenile fish in the food web of coastal
   nurseries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   to predator odor (PO) to test responses to predator cues alone.
   Behavioral and neuroendocrine assessments were conducted to determine

   outcomes in adulthood. Acute response to an adolescent stressor may not

Abstract = {{Understanding the decisions that animals make in the presence of

   reproductive options. The wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, has a
   conspicuous courtship display that is an indicator of male quality. In
   an initial experiment, we determined that male courtship was highly
   repeatable and correlated with symmetry. We then used symmetry as an
   indicator of quality to explore the reactions of males when presented
   with simulated predation risk and an attractive virgin female. There
   were no differences in courtship features between risk and no risk
   treatments unless we took into account male quality. High-quality males
   reduced courtship intensity under risk conditions suggesting that they
   estimated their long-term fitness prospects as strong. This response is
   consistent with the asset protection principle, which suggests that
   animals with high value traits should behave cautiously. Low-quality
   males courted at high levels under predation risk, which seemed to be
   reckless attempts to attract females. This response is analogous to the
   ``desperado effect,{''} which is one explanation for vigorous fighting
   by inferior animals in contests. Although females used behavior to
   select males when no predator information was present, they seemed to
   use symmetry in the presence of predator cues. The ability of females to
   select the most attractive males suggests that they can accurately
   assess male quality under laboratory conditions. High courting

Abstract = {{How animals trade-off food availability and predation threats is a

   foraging and predation risk. Although these environmental factors (food
   and predation threat) vary spatially within habitats, they also vary
   temporally, and in marine habitats, this can be determined by not only
   the diel cycle but also the tidal cycle. Humbug damselfish, Dascyllus
   aruanus, live in small groups of unrelated individuals within and around
   branching coral heads, which they collectively withdraw into to escape a
   predation threat. In this study, we measured the proportion of
   individuals in the colony that were outside the coral head before and

Abstract = {{Several genera belonging to the nematode family Diplogastridae show
   characteristic dimorphism in their feeding structures; specifically,
   they have microbial feeding stenostomatous and predatory eurystomatous
   morphs. A diplogastrid satellite model species, Pristionchus pacificus,
   and its close relatives have become a model system for studying this
   phenotypic plasticity, with intensive physiological and structural
   studies having been undertaken. However, the many other species that are
   morphologically and phylogenetically divergent from P. pacificus have
   not been examined to date. In the present study, the detailed stomatal
   structure and induction of dimorphism in Neodiplogaster acaloleptae were
   examined. N. acaloleptae has a fungal feeding stenostomatous morph and a
   predatory eurystomatous morph. The predatory morph was induced by
   starvation, high population density, and coculturing with its potential
   prey, Caenorhabditis elegans. The feeding behavior of the stenostomatous
   and eurystomatous morphs of N. acaloleptae was confirmed, demonstrating
   that 1) the stomatal and pharyngeal movements of the two morphs were
   basically identical, and 2) the stomatal elements were protracted to cut
   open the hyphae and/or prey to feed when a N. acaloleptae flips its
   dorsal movable tooth dorsally and tilts its subventral stegostomatal
   cylinder ventrally, forming a pair of scissors to cut the food source.
   The stoma morphology of N. acaloleptae with a single movable tooth and a
   long stoma is markedly different from that of Pristionchus, which has
   two movable teeth and a short stoma. It is, however, similar to that of
   Mononchoides, tentatively a sister to Neodiplogaster.}},

   traditional appendages, such as legs. At the same time, the Hh signaling
   pathway has acquired a novel and highly unusual role in the
   nutrition-dependent regulation of horn polyphenisms by actively
   suppressing horn formation in low-nutrition males. Down-regulation of Hh
   signaling lifts this inhibition and returns a highly derived sigmoid
   horn body size allometry to its presumed ancestral, linear state. Our
   results suggest that recruitment of the Hh signaling pathway may have
   been a key step in the evolution of trait thresholds, such as those
   involved in horn polyphenisms and the corresponding origin of
   alternative phenotypes and complex allometries.}},

Title = {{A pancreatic exocrine-like cell regulatory circuit operating in the
   upper stomach of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus larva}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Digestive cells are present in all metazoans and provide the
   energy necessary for the whole organism. Pancreatic exocrine cells are a
   unique vertebrate cell type involved in extracellular digestion of a
   wide range of nutrients. Although the organization and regulation of
   this cell type is intensively studied in vertebrates, its evolutionary
   history is still unknown. In order to understand which are the elements
   that define the pancreatic exocrine phenotype, we have analyzed the
   expression of genes that contribute to specification and function of
   this cell-type in an early branching deuterostome, the sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.
   Results: We defined the spatial and temporal expression of sea urchin
   orthologs of pancreatic exocrine genes and described a unique population
   of cells clustered in the upper stomach of the sea urchin embryo where
   exocrine markers are co-expressed. We used a combination of perturbation
   analysis, drug and feeding experiments and found that in these cells of
   the sea urchin embryo gene expression and gene regulatory interactions
   resemble that of bona fide pancreatic exocrine cells. We show that the
   sea urchin Ptf1a, a key transcriptional activator of digestive enzymes
   in pancreatic exocrine cells, can substitute for its vertebrate ortholog
   in activating downstream genes.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our study is the first to show with molecular
   tools that defining features of a vertebrate cell-type, the pancreatic
   exocrine cell, are shared by a non-vertebrate deuterostome. Our results
   indicate that the functional cell-type unit of the vertebrate pancreas
   may evolutionarily predate the emergence of the pancreas as a discrete
   organ. From an evolutionary perspective, these results encourage to
   further explore the homologs of other vertebrate cell-types in
   traditional or newly emerging deuterostome systems.}},

   Design: A cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Based on data from the 2010 to 2012 Korean National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).
   Participants: The study included 17 446 Korean individuals.
   Main outcome measures: Participants provided demographic, socio-economic
   and behavioural information, as well as responses to questionnaires
   assessing the presence and severity of tinnitus, mental health status
   regarding stress, depression, and suicidal ideation and attempts. In the
   univariate analysis, the Rao-Scott chi-square test and logistic

   and risk factors. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were
   used to examine the association between tinnitus and mental status.
   Results: A total of 20.9\% and 1.2\% of participants with tinnitus, and
   12.2\% and 0.6\% of those without, reported suicidal ideation and
   attempts, respectively (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.001). Participants
   reporting suicide attempts showed a higher proportion of severe annoying

Abstract = {{Objectives: Cardiovascular and metabolic traits (CMT) are influenced by
   complex interactive processes including diet, lifestyle, and genetic
   predisposition. The present study investigated the interactions of these
   risk factors in relation to CMTs in the Turkish population.
   Methods: We applied bootstrap agglomerative hierarchical clustering and
   Bayesian network learning algorithms to identify the causative
   relationships among genes involved in different biological mechanisms
   (i.e., lipid metabolism, hormone metabolism, cellular detoxification,
   aging, and energy metabolism), lifestyle (i.e., physical activity,
   smoking behavior, and metropolitan residency), anthropometric traits
   (i.e., body mass index, body fat ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio), and
   dietary habits (i.e., daily intakes of macro- and micronutrients) in
   relation to CMTs (i.e., health conditions and blood parameters).
   Results: We identified significant correlations between dietary habits
   (soybean and vitamin B12 intakes) and different cardiometabolic diseases
   that were confirmed by the Bayesian network learning algorithm. Genetic
   factors contributed to these disease risks also through the pleiotropy
   of some genetic variants (i.e., F5 rs6025 and MTR rs180508). However, we
   also observed that certain genetic associations are indirect since they
   are due to the causative relationships among the CMTs (e.g., APOC3
   rs5128 is associated with low-density lipoproteins cholesterol and, by
   extension, total cholesterol).
   Conclusions: Our study applied a novel approach to integrate various
   sources of information and dissect the complex interactive processes
   related to CMTs. Our data indicated that complex causative networks are
   present: causative relationships exist among CMTs and are affected by
   genetic factors (with pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic effects) and
   dietary habits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although shell colour polymorphism of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis is
   a well-known phenomenon, proximate and ultimate factors driving its
   evolution remain uncertain. Polymorphic species show variation in
   behavioural responses to selective forces. Therefore, we estimated
   effects of various environmental factors (temperature, humidity, food
   availability, (micro)habitat structure and predatory pressure) on
   behavioural response (frequency of locomotion, climbing and hiding) of
   C. nemoralis morphs, in experimental and natural conditions. In the
   experimental part of study, the frequency of locomotion was negatively
   affected by temperature and the presence of food and positively
   influenced by the presence of light. Morphs significantly differed in
   behavioural responses to environmental variability. Pink mid-banded and
   yellow five-banded morphs climbed less often and hide in shelter more
   often than yellow and pink unbanded individuals when temperature was low
   and food was absent. Snails fed most often at moderate temperature
   compared to low and high temperatures. Field investigations partially
   confirmed differences among morphs in frequency of climbing, but not in
   terms of probability of hiding in sheltered sites. In natural colonies,
   temperature and (micro)habitat structure significantly affected
   frequency of climbing as well as hiding in shelter. Snails more often
   hid in sheltered sites where thrushes preyed on Cepaea. Tendency of
   unbanded morphs to climb trees may have evolved under avian predatory
   pressure as thrushes forage on a ground. Tendency of banded morphs to
   hide in sheltered sites may reflect prey preferences for cryptic
   background. The results implicate that differential behaviour of C.
   nemoralis morphs compensate for their morphological and physiological
   limitations of adaptation to habitat.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{83-100}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies have examined how predator diets influence prey
   responses to predation risk, but the role predator diet plays in
   modulating prey responses remains equivocal. We reviewed 405
   predator-prey studies in 109 published articles that investigated
   changes in prey responses when predators consumed different prey items.
   In 54 \% of reviewed studies, prey responses were influenced by predator
   diet. The value of responding based on a predator's recent diet
   increased when predators specialized more strongly on particular prey
   species, which may create patterns in diet cue use among prey depending
   upon whether they are preyed upon by generalist or specialist predators.
   Further, prey can alleviate costs or accrue greater benefits using diet
   cues as secondary sources of information to fine tune responses to
   predators and to learn novel risk cues from exotic predators or alarm
   cues from sympatric prey species. However, the ability to draw broad
   conclusions regarding use of predator diet cues by prey was limited by a
   lack of research identifying molecular structures of the chemicals that
   mediate these interactions. Conclusions are also limited by a narrow
   research focus. Seventy percent of reviewed studies were performed in
   freshwater systems, with a limited range of model predator-prey systems,
   and 98 \% of reviewed studies were performed in laboratory settings.
   Besides identifying the molecules prey use to detect predators, future
   studies should strive to manipulate different aspects of prey responses
   to predator diet across a broader range of predator-prey species,
   particularly in marine and terrestrial systems, and to expand studies
   into the field.}},

Journal = {{FRESHWATER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{619-630}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aquatic organisms that live at high latitudes and elevations are
   especially vulnerable to climate-change induced alterations in snowpack,
   snowmelt, and evaporation rates, all of which affect basin filling and
   drying dates. Extraordinarily early drying events in shallow ponds and
   wetlands at our study sites prompted us to conduct 2 mesocosm
   experiments to document how proximate cues of drying modify agonistic
   behaviors among larvae of the caddisfly, Asynarchus nigriculus. Larvae
   are mainly detritivores but can be extremely aggressive and engage in
   mob cannibalism, perhaps to obtain a dietary supplement that hastens
   escape from drying basins. In one experiment, we manipulated caddisfly
   density to simulate the effects of crowding during pond drying. In a 2nd
   experiment, we reduced water levels and manipulated a protein supplement
   that mimics the dietary benefits of cannibalism. We quantified the
   effects of those manipulations on aggressive behaviors that are
   precursors to cannibalism and on development time to pupation. Frequency
   and duration of agonistic encounters increased as a function of larval
   density and, independent of density, were higher in drying than
   nondrying treatments, especially in the absence of a protein supplement.
   Pupation occurred earlier in high- than low-density treatments and
   earlier with than without a protein supplement. In contrast, the timing
   of pupation was not accelerated in drying compared with nondrying
   treatments, which might reflect the extreme diel temperature
   fluctuations in drying ponds, hence suboptimal growth conditions. Our
   findings provide evidence that declining water levels and crowding serve
   as cues that enable caddisflies to adjust behavior and development in
   the face of habitat drying. Early drying events observed in recent years
   may exceed the limits of this flexibility and portend the demise of
   populations in temporary habitats that historically supported this
   species.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Prey mortality depends on the likelihood of encountering a predator and
   of being killed following such an encounter. While the proactive
   responses of large herbivores to the risk of predation have been well
   documented, the reactive responses of prey following encounters have
   been less well studied and restricted mostly to northern temperate
   ecosystems. We postulated that the reactive response should depend on
   the habitat selection of the prey species as well as the hunting tactic
   (cursorial versus stalking) of the predator. We investigated the
   reactive responses of a selective grazer, the blue wildebeest,
   Connochaetes taurinus, and a generalist grazer, the plains zebra, Equus
   quagga, to encounters with lions, Panthera leo, their main predator, in
   Kruger National Park. We used simultaneous global positioning system
   (GPS) locations of prey and predators to identify encounters and assess
   their frequency and characteristics (e.g. time of day). We compared both
   the immediate response (stay or flee) and subsequent movement (remain in
   the habitat patch or relocate) of the two ungulate species following
   encounters with lions. Despite being more predictably located in open
   short grass areas, wildebeest encountered lions no more frequently than
   zebra. However, being more selective for these particular habitat types,
   wildebeest more often stayed near the encounter site than zebra.
   Specifically, wildebeest were less likely to leave when located in more
   open areas with short grass providing both high-quality food and little
   concealment for stalking lions. We suggest that this is because
   wildebeest incur higher risks and greater feeding costs than zebra
   should they relocate, owing to their narrower preference for areas of
   short grass. Our findings show how the adaptive responses of wildebeest
   and zebra following encounters with their major predator depend on their
   habitat requirements. (c) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Animal models of obesity are numerous and diverse in terms of
   identifying specific neural and peripheral mechanisms related to
   obesity; however, they are limited when it comes to behavior. The
   standard behavioral measure of food intake in most animal models occurs

   important features of obesity-related food consumption namely,
   properties of food availability, such as effort and delay to obtaining
   food. Behavior economics expands behavioral measures of obesity animal
   models by identifying such behavioral mechanisms. First, economic demand
   analysis allows researchers to understand the role of effort in food
   procurement, and how physiological and neural mechanisms are related.
   Second, studies on delay discounting contribute to a growing literature
   that shows that sensitivity to delayed food- and food-related outcomes

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Chelating agents, such as small peptides, can decrease free
   iron content and increase iron bioavailability. They may have promising
   therapeutic potential and may prevent the pro-oxidant effects of low
   molecular weight iron. Hairtail is a species of fish that is rich in
   easily digestible proteins. We extended this strategy for iron delivery
   by using an enzymatic hydrolysate of hairtail as the chelating agent and
   found that the ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides have anti-anaemic
   activity in Sprague-Dawley rats with anaemia.
   RESULTS: The anti-anaemic activity of ferrous-chelating hairtail
   peptides prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of the hairtail and ferrous
   chelation was studied in rat models of iron deficiency anaemia. After
   the end of the 35 d experiment, we noted significant differences in
   haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, haemoglobin distribution width,
   and ferritin concentrations between those animals supplemented with
   ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides and FeSO4 and healthy animals. There
   were no negative side effects on the animals' growth or behaviour. There
   was no obvious inflammation in the intestinal mucosa lamina propria and
   no unbalance of intestinal flora.
   CONCLUSION: The novel ferrous-chelating hairtail peptides may be a
   suitable fortificant for improving iron-deficiency status. Our findings
   demonstrated that this multi-tracer technique has many applications in

Abstract = {{1. Invasive species are considered a main driver of pollinator declines,
   yet the direct effects of invasive alien plants on pollinators are
   poorly understood.
   2. Abundant, invasive plant species can provide a copious nectar
   resource for native pollinators. However, the nectar of some plants
   contains secondary compounds, usually associated with defence against
   herbivores. The impacts of these compounds on pollinators are often
   unknown.
   3. We compared how consumption of grayanotoxin I and III, natural
   secondary compounds in the nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum L.,
   affected three native bee species: a honeybee, (Apis mellifera L.), a
   solitary mining bee (Andrena carantonica, Perez) and a bumblebee,
   (Bombus terrestris, L.).
   4. Survival of the solitary bee and the bumblebee species was not
   affected by either grayanotoxin, but honeybees were similar to 20x more
   likely to die when fed solutions containing grayanotoxin I. Furthermore,
   solitary bees were deterred from feeding and exhibited malaise
   behaviours indicative of sublethal toxicity in response to consumption
   of grayanotoxin I. In contrast, grayanotoxins did not affect bumblebee
   survival or behaviour, even when bees were subjected to multiple
   stressors (parasite infection or food stress).
   5. Our experiments suggest that while R. ponticum provides abundant
   floral nectar, it is only available as a food resource to pollinators
   that tolerate grayanotoxins. Pollinators whose health is negatively
   affected by grayanotoxins may experience negative impacts from R.
   ponticum invasion directly (if they consume R. ponticum nectar) or
   indirectly (if native floral resources are replaced by R. ponticum).
   6. Our study makes a novel comparison of the effects of a natural nectar
   secondary compound on three pollinator species and clearly demonstrates
   drastic variation in the responses of different key pollinator taxa to a
   nectar toxin. Our findings are thus in congruence with literature
   demonstrating the varying effects of invasive plant chemistry on native
   foliar herbivores, and our work demonstrates that nectar chemistry
   should be taken into account when determining the impacts of plant
   invasion for native pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{High concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a chemical
   compound released by lysed phytoplankton, may indicate high rates of
   grazing by zooplankton and may thus be a foraging cue for planktivorous
   fishes. Previous studies have shown that some planktivorous fishes and
   birds aggregate or alter locomotory behavior in response to this
   chemical cue, which is likely adaptive because it helps them locate
   prey. These behavioral responses have been demonstrated in juveniles and
   adults, but no studies have tested for effects on larval fish. Larvae
   suffer from high mortality rates and are vulnerable to starvation. While
   larvae are generally thought to be visual predators, they actually have
   poor vision and cryptic prey. Thus, larval fish should benefit from a
   chemical cue that provides information on prey abundance. We reared
   larval sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, for one week and supplemented
   feedings with varying concentrations of DMSP to test the hypothesis that
   DMSP affects larval survival. Ecologically relevant DMSP concentrations
   increased larval survival by up to 70 \%, which has implications for
   production in aquaculture and recruitment in nature. These results
   provide a new tool for increasing larval production in aquaculture and
   also suggest that larvae may use DMSP as an olfactory cue. The release
   of DMSP may be a previously unappreciated mechanism through which
   phytoplankton affect larval survival and recruitment.}},

   territorial defense.Here, we test the hypothesis that background
   predation level and reproductive status interact to determine the form
   and intensity of threat-sensitive behavioral decisions of wild-caught
   female Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata. Gravid and nongravid
   guppies collected from high-and low-predation pressure populations were
   exposed to serial dilutions of conspecific chemical alarm cues. Our
   results demonstrate that there was `no effect of reproductive status on
   the response of females originating from a low-predation population,
   with both gravid and nongravid guppies exhibiting strong anti-predator
   responses to the lowest concentration of alarm cues tested. Increasing
   cue concentrations did not result in increases in response intensity.
   Conversely, we found a significant effect of reproductive status among
   guppies from a high-predation population. Nongravid females from the
   high-predation population exhibited a strong graded (proportional)
   response to increasing concentrations of alarm cue. Gravid females from
   the same high-predation population, however, shifted to a nongraded
   response. Together, these results demonstrate that accrued reproductive
   assets influence the threat-sensitive behavioral decisions of prey, but
   only under conditions of high-ambient predation risk.}},

Title = {{A Technology-Mediated Behavioral Weight Gain Prevention Intervention for
   College Students: Controlled, Quasi-Experimental Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Both men and women are vulnerable to weight gain during the
   college years, and this phenomenon is linked to an increased risk of
   several chronic diseases and mortality. Technology represents an
   attractive medium for the delivery of weight control interventions
   focused on college students, given its reach and appeal among this
   population. However, few technology-mediated weight gain prevention
   interventions have been evaluated for college students.
   Objective: This study examined a new technology-based, social
   media-facilitated weight gain prevention intervention for college
   students.
   Methods: Undergraduates (n = 58) in two sections of a public university
   course were allocated to either a behavioral weight gain prevention
   intervention (Healthy Weight, HW; N = 29) or a human papillomavirus
   (HPV) vaccination awareness intervention (control; N = 29). All students
   were enrolled, regardless of initial body weight or expressed interest
   in weight management. The interventions delivered 8 lessons via
   electronic newsletters and Facebook postings over 9 weeks, which were
   designed to foster social support and introduce relevant educational
   content. The HW intervention targeted behavioral strategies to prevent
   weight gain and provided participants with a Wi-Fi-enabled scale and an
   electronic physical activity tracker to facilitate weight regulation. A
   repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine
   within-and between-group differences in measures of self-reported weight
   control practices and objectively measured weight. Use of each
   intervention medium and device was objectively tracked, and intervention
   satisfaction measures were obtained.
   Results: Students remained weight stable (HW: -0.48+1.9 kg; control:
   -0.45+1.4 kg), with no significant difference between groups over 9
   weeks (P =. 94). However, HW students reported a significantly greater
   increase in the number of appropriate weight control strategies than did
   controls (2.1+4.5 vs -1.1+3.4, respectively; P =. 003) and there was no
   increase in inappropriate weight control behaviors (P =. 11). More than
   90\% of students in the HW arm opened the electronic newsletters each
   week, and the average number of Facebook interactions (comments and
   likes) per student each week was 3.3+1.4. Each self-monitoring device
   was initialized by 90\% of HW students. On average, they used their
   physical activity tracker for 23.7+15.2 days and their Wi-Fi scale for
   14.1+13.1 days over the 9 weeks. HW students rated the intervention
   favorably.
   Conclusions: The short-term effect of this technology-based weight gain
   prevention intervention for college students is promising and merits
   evaluation over a longer duration to determine whether engagement and
   behavioral improvements positively affect weight outcomes and can be
   maintained.}},

   morphometric characteristics between regions. Examination of the
   contribution of each morphometric variable to the principal components

   to be associated with the shell and aperture length and width. Samples
   from the Atlantic Ocean and the Alboran Sea had the largest shell size

Title = {{Towards evenly distributed grazing patterns: including social context in
   sheep management strategies}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background. A large proportion of natural grasslands around the world is
   exposed to overgrazing resulting in land degradation and biodiversity
   loss. Although there is an increasing effort in the promotion of
   sustainable livestock management, rangeland degradation still occurs
   because animals' foraging behaviour is highly selective at different
   spatial scales. The assessment of the ecological mechanisms modulating
   the spatial distribution of grazing and how to control it has critical
   implications for long term conservation of resources and the
   sustainability of livestock production. Considering the relevance of
   social interactions on animals' space use patterns, our aim was to
   explore the potential effects of including animals' social context into
   management strategies using domestic sheep grazing in rangelands as case
   study.
   Methods. We used GPS data from 19 Merino sheep (approximately 10\% of
   the flock) grazing on three different paddocks (with sizes from 80 to
   1000 Ha) during a year, to estimate resource selection functions of
   sheep grazing in flocks of different levels of heterogeneity. We
   assessed the effects of sheep class (i.e., ewes, wethers, and hoggets),
   age, body condition and time since release on habitat selection
   patterns.
   Results. We found that social rank was reflected on sheep habitat use,
   where dominant individuals (i.e., reproductive females) used more
   intensively the most preferred areas and low-ranked (i.e., yearlings)
   used less preferred areas. Our results showed that when sheep grazed on
   more heterogeneous flocks, grazing patterns were more evenly distributed
   at all the paddocks considered in this study. On the other hand, when
   high-ranked individuals were removed from the flock, low-ranked sheep
   shifted their selection patterns by increasing the use of the most
   preferred areas and strongly avoided to use less preferred sites (i.e.,
   a highly selective grazing behaviour).
   Discussion. Although homogenization and segregation of flocks by classes
   are common practices to increase flock productivity, we are proposing an
   alternative that employs behavioural interactions in heterogeneous
   flocks to generate more evenly distributed grazing patterns. This
   practice can be combined with other practices such as rotational grazing
   and guardian dogs (to decrease mortality levels that may be generated by
   sheep grazing on more risky habitats). This does not imply any
   modifications of livestock stocking rates and densities or any
   additional investments for labour and materials. Considering livestock
   behaviour is critical for the design of sustainable management practices
   that balance landscape conservation and livestock productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of the German
   version of the Self-Harm Inventory (SHI) and examining the lifetime
   prevalence and correlates of self-harm in a representative German
   population sample (N = 2,507; age mean = 48.79, SD = 18.11; range 14 to
   94 years; 55.5\% women) using the SHI. All participants answered the
   German SHI, the short form of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-15),
   the ultra-brief Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety
   (PHQ-4), and provided sociodemographic information. The one-factorial
   structure of the SHI was replicated using a confirmatory factor
   analysis. Internal consistency coefficients were sufficient and in line
   with previous studies. Almost half of the sample (49\%) acknowledged at
   least one self-harming behavior over the life-span, most frequently
   indirect forms of self-harm. The rate of participants who engaged in at
   least one SHI behavior was higher among men than women (51.6\% vs.
   46.9\%, respectively, chi(2) = 5.38, p = 0.020). Higher SHI scores were
   related to younger age, male gender, living alone, more symptoms of
   anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), higher impulsivity scores (BIS-15), and
   suffering from obesity grade 2. Women engaged more often in discreet
   forms of self-harm than men, e.g., preventing wounds from healing,
   exercising an injury, starving, and abusing laxatives. In terms of other
   indirect self-harming behaviors, men admitted more often driving
   recklessly, being promiscuous and losing a job on purpose, while women
   reported more frequently engaging in emotionally abusive relationships.
   With respect to direct self-harm, women were more likely to endorse
   suicide attempts and cutting, while men admitted more often
   head-banging. The findings suggest that self-harm constitutes a common
   problem. Future longitudinal studies are required to examine the natural
   course, sociodemographic and psychopathological risk factors, as well as
   possible time-trends of self-harming behaviors in more depth.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Selection may favour individuals of the same population to differ
   consistently in nutritional preference, for example, because optimal
   diets covary with morphology or personality. We provided Southern field
   crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) with two synthetic food sources
   (carbohydrates and proteins) and quantified repeatedly how much of each
   macronutrient was consumed by each individual. We then quantified (i)
   whether individuals were repeatable in carbohydrate and protein intake
   rate, (ii) whether an individual's average daily intake of carbohydrates
   was correlated with its average daily intake of protein, and (iii)
   whether short-term changes in intake of carbohydrates coincided with
   changes in intake of protein within individuals. Intake rates were
   individually repeatable for both macronutrients. However, individuals
   differed in their relative daily intake of carbohydrates versus proteins
   (i.e., `nutritional preference'). By contrast, total consumption varied
   plastically as a function of body weight within individuals. Body
   weight-but not personality (i.e., aggression, exploration
   behaviour)positively predicted nutritional preference at the individual
   level as large crickets repeatedly consumed a higher carbohydrate to
   protein ratio compared to small ones. Our finding of level-specific
   associations between the consumption of distinct nutritional components
   demonstrates the merit of applying multivariate and multi-level
   viewpoints to the study of nutritional preference.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged consumption of ketogenic diets (KD) has reported
   neuroprotective benefits. Several studies suggest MD interventions could
   be useful in the management of neurological and developmental disorders.
   Alterations in the Engrailed (En) genes, specifically Engrailed 2 (En2),
   have neurodevelopmental consequences and produce autism-related
   behaviors. The following studies used En2 knockout (MO; En2(-/-)), and
   wild-type (WT; En2(+/+)), male mice fed either KD (80\% fat, 0.1\%
   carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10\% fat, 70\% carbohydrates). The
   objective was to determine whether a MD fed from weaning at postnatal
   day (PND) 21 to adulthood (PND 60) would alter brain monoamines
   concentrations, previously found dysregulated, and improve social
   outcomes. In WT animals, there was an increase in hypothalamic
   norepinephrine content in the KD-fed group. However, regional monoamines
   were not altered in KO mice in MD-fed compared with CD-fed group. In
   order to determine the effects of juvenile exposure to KD in mice with
   normal blood ketone levels, separate experiments were conducted in mice
   removed from the KD or CD and fed standard chow for 2 days (PND 62). In
   a three-chamber social test with a novel mouse, MO mice previously
   exposed to the KD displayed similar social and self-grooming behaviors
   compared with the WT group. Groups previously exposed to a KD,
   regardless of genotype, had more c-Fos-positive cells in the cingulate
   cortex, lateral septal nuclei, and anterior bed nucleus of the stria
   terminalis. In the novel object condition, MO mice previously exposed to
   MD had similar behavioral responses and pattern of c-Fos
   immunoreactivity compared with the WT group. Thus, juvenile exposure to
   MD resulted in short-term consequences of improving social interactions
   and appropriate exploratory behaviors in a mouse model that displays
   autism-related behaviors. Such findings further our understanding of
   metabolic-based therapies for neurological and developmental disorders.

Abstract = {{We investigated diet and feeding behavior of the acrobatic cavy Kerodon
   acrobata, a rare caviomorph rodent endemic from the Cerrado (Brazilian
   savannah). We tested whether its trophic niche breadth varies between
   seasons and whether this species shows seasonal differences in food
   resource use. Feeding behavior was observed through observations of
   foraging activities in dry forest associated with limestone outcroppings
   in central Brazil. K. acrobata showed a generalist diet, feeding on
   leaves from at least 16 native plant families, also consuming flowers
   and fruits collected directly from plants or litterfall as well as
   branches, sprouts, and bark. The diversity of feeding behavior
   categories did not differ significantly between rainy and dry seasons.
   The trophic niche breadth considering the plant species consumed,
   however, decreased during the dry season, when this rodent relied mainly
   on fallen flowers of Handroanthus serratifolius (Caricaceae; about 44 \%
   of the identified feeding records). The diet of the acrobatic cavy was
   influenced by the availability of falling leaves and flowers during the
   dry season, when the animals focused their foraging activities on
   litterfall. The animals seemed not to extend their behavioral repertoire
   of foraging in the dry season; instead, they seasonally changed their
   resource exploitation strategy by altering the proportions of items used
   and the plant species consumed. The trophic niche breadth and plastic
   feeding behavior of the acrobatic cavies may explain their persistence
   in disturbed habitats. Their close relationship with the forests studied
   indicates the vulnerability of K. acrobata to activities that may
   threaten the integrity of dry forest areas.}},

Abstract = {{Biological variability is no longer considered as statistical noise, but
   rather as an adaptive benefit. This variability comes from consistent
   differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals
   to a changing/challenging environment, named ``coping style{''},
   ``temperament{''} or ``personality{''}. Many studies have described how
   to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency
   over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about
   the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because
   contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to
   the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in
   personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely
   to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as
   important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was
   to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability)
   impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis,
   one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared
   juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for
   feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days.
   Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable
   versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass
   reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer
   than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they
   took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 +/-
   34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 +/- 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was
   similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing
   a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before
   and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance
   of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness.
   In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time
   should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as
   growth and behavior. Although personality traits are partially
   heritable, this study demonstrates the important influence of
   environmental conditions and life history on behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity.
   Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly.
   Residual lifespan increased by 57 \% when colonies were penned for 20
   days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory.
   Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into
   the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation
   did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population
   size declined when mortality exceeded 4 \% per day. Experimental
   increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to
   foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These
   results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers
   that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the
   well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained
   not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing
   at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker
   depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks,
   opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by
   inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger
   workers.}},

Abstract = {{1. Developmental experience, for example food abundance during juvenile
   stages, is known to affect life history and behaviour. However, the life
   history and behavioural consequences of developmental experience have
   rarely been studied in concert. As a result, it is still unclear whether
   developmental experience affects behaviour through changes in life
   history, or independently of it. 2. The effect of developmental
   experience on life history and behaviour may also be masked or affected
   by individual condition during adulthood. Thus, it is critical to tease
   apart the effects of developmental experience and current individual
   condition on life history and behaviour. 3. In this study, we
   manipulated food abundance during development in the western black widow
   spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing spiders on either a restricted
   or ad lib diet. We separated developmental from condition-dependent
   effects by assaying adult foraging behaviour (tendency to attack prey
   and to stay on out of the refuge following an attack) and web structure
   multiple times under different levels of satiation following different
   developmental treatments. 4. Spiders reared under food restriction
   matured slower and at a smaller size than spiders reared in ad lib
   conditions. Spiders reared on a restricted diet were more aggressive
   towards prey and built webs structured for prey capture, while spiders
   reared on an ad lib diet were less aggressive and built safer webs.
   Developmental treatment affected which traits were plastic as adults:
   restricted spiders built safer webs when their adult condition
   increased, while ad lib spiders reduced their aggression when their
   adult condition increased. The amount of individual variation in
   behaviour and web structure varied with developmental treatment. Spiders
   reared on a restricted diet exhibited consistent variation in all
   aspects of foraging behaviour and web structure, while spiders reared on
   an ad lib diet exhibited consistent individual variation in aggression
   and web weight only. 5. Developmental experience affected the average
   life history, behaviour and web structure of spiders, but also shaped
   the amount of phenotypic variation observed among individuals.
   Surprisingly, developmental experience also determined the particular
   way in which individuals plastically adjusted their behaviour and web
   structure to changes in adult condition.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining the remarkable variation in socially monogamous females'
   extrapair (EP) behaviour revealed by decades of molecular paternity
   testing remains an important challenge. One hypothesis proposes that
   restrictive environmental conditions (e.g. extreme weather, food
   scarcity) limit females' resources and increase EP behaviour costs,
   forcing females to reduce EP reproductive behaviours. For the first
   time, we tested this hypothesis by directly quantifying within-pair and
   EP behaviours rather than inferring behaviour from paternity. We
   evaluated whether warmer sea surface temperatures depress total
   pre-laying reproductive behaviours, and particularly EP behaviours, in
   socially paired female blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii). Warm waters
   in the Eastern Pacific are associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation
   and lead to decreased food availability and reproductive success in this
   and other marine predators. With warmer waters, females decreased their
   neighbourhood attendance, total copulation frequency and laying
   probability, suggesting that they contend with restricted resources by
   prioritizing self-maintenance and committing less to reproduction,
   sometimes abandoning the attempt altogether. Females were also less
   likely to participate in EP courtship and copulations, but when they
   did, rates of these behaviours were unaffected by water temperature.
   Females' neighbourhood attendance, total copulation frequency and EP
   courtship probability responded to temperature differences at the
   between-season scale, and neighbourhood attendance and EP copulation
   probability were affected by within-season fluctuations. Path analysis
   indicated that decreased EP participation was not attributable to
   reduced female time available for EP activities. Together, our results
   suggest that immediate time and energy constraints were not the main
   factors limiting females' infidelity. Our study shows that El Nino
   conditions depress female boobies' EP participation and total
   reproductive activity. In addition to increasing general
   self-maintenance and reproductive costs, warm waters may increase costs
   specific to EP behaviours including divorce, reduced male parental care,
   or pathogen exposure. Our results suggest that female boobies
   strategically refrained from EP behaviours to avoid these or other
   longer-term costs, rather than being compelled by immediate constraints.
   This study demonstrates that current environmental conditions affect
   females' mating decisions, contributing to variation in EP behaviours,
   even in a long-lived, iteroparous species that can buffer against
   temporary adversity.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding habitat use by animals requires understanding the
   simultaneous tradeoffs between food and predation risk within a
   landscape. Quantifying the synergy between patches that provide quality
   food and those that are safe from predators at a scale relevant to a
   foraging animal could better reveal the parameters that influence
   habitat selection. To understand more thoroughly how animals select
   habitat components, we investigated tradeoffs between diet quality and
   predation risk in a species endemic to sagebrush Artemisia spp.
   communities in North America, the pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis.
   This species is a rare example of a specialist herbivore that relies
   almost entirely on sagebrush for food and cover. We hypothesized that
   pygmy rabbits would forage in areas with low food risk (free of plant
   secondary metabolites, PSMs) and low predation risk (high concealment).
   However, because of relatively high tolerance to PSMs in sagebrush by
   pygmy rabbits, we hypothesized that they would trade off the risk of
   PSM-containing food to select lower predation risk when risks
   co-occurred. We compared food intake of pygmy rabbits during three
   double-choice trials designed to examine tradeoffs by offering animals
   two levels of food risk (1,8-cineole, a PSM) and predation risk
   (concealment cover). Rabbits ate more food at feeding stations with
   PSM-free food and high concealment cover. However, interactions between
   PSMs and cover suggested that the value of PSM-free food could be
   reduced if concealment is low and the value of high concealment can
   decrease if food contains PSMs. Furthermore, foraging decisions by
   individual rabbits suggested variation in tolerance of food or predation
   risks.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{145-153}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In group-living mammals, social dominance can be achieved and maintained
   via kin support, winner-loser effects and individual differences in
   resource-holding potential (RHP). When dominance is based on RHP, the
   likelihood of winning is also influenced by the incentive to compete.
   For females, this equation can be quite complex, as both age and
   reproductive state can alter the relative value of resources and the
   risks associated with fighting. For example, females that are young,
   pregnant or lactating may have high nutritional demands, while lactating
   females also face risks associated with offspring survival. To date,
   however, there have been few studies investigating how such factors
   influence female agonistic relationships. Here, we use 2 years of data
   to evaluate how age and reproductive state influence the probability of
   winning, focusing on two groups (5-9 and 10-12 females) of wild Phayre's
   leaf monkeys, Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus, at Phu Khieo Wildlife
   Sanctuary, Thailand. Consistent with previous studies, we found that
   young females and pregnant females were more likely to win dyadic
   interactions in the smaller group, PA. By contrast, the likelihood of
   winning was unrelated to age in the larger group, PB. Moreover,
   differences between reproductive states were less pronounced in PB, with
   females that were pregnant or in early lactation being more likely to
   win compared to females that were cycling. The deviating results for PB
   were likely associated with a greater number of competitors and small
   age differences intensifying intrasexual competition. These results
   highlight the importance of individual as well as demographic factors in
   female dominance relationships. In this population, females with high
   nutritional demands are more likely to win agonistic encounters,
   suggesting that female-female competition occurs primarily over access
   to resources. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{While most current predictive models agree that the climate is changing,
   it is not yet clear what impact these changes will have on animal
   populations. It is vital to determine the potential consequences in
   order to develop future management and conservation strategies. Climate
   change may impact population stability by prompting changes in breeding
   behaviour. For example, if above-average temperatures negatively affect
   adult body condition, this will increase the cost of parental care.
   Theory suggests that under this scenario, individuals may trade off
   their own body condition and survival against that of their young.
   Despite convincing evidence that this parental care trade-off exists in
   nature, the potential impact of climate change on parental investment
   strategies has rarely been investigated. In cooperatively breeding
   species, group-living adults can gain group size benefits, such as
   assistance with raising young. These benefits may mediate the effects of
   climate change on adult condition and subsequent investment in young.
   Here, we investigated the extent to which high temperatures and rainfall
   variation affect (1) adult provisioning rates to dependent nestlings,
   (2) offspring development and (3) the cost of offspring care in the
   cooperatively breeding pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor. We found that
   overall, adults provisioned young significantly less on hot days.
   However, this pattern was affected by rank: dominant individuals
   provisioned significantly less while subordinates did not. Offspring
   development was negatively affected by heatwave events, suggesting that
   young suffer from reduced investment on hot days. However, there was no
   evidence that the cost of provisioning young increased during heatwave
   periods, perhaps owing to the reduction in investment by adults. This
   study provides some of the first evidence that higher temperatures
   affect investment decisions in cooperative breeders and that dominant
   and subordinate individuals respond differently to this stressor. (C)

   sticklebacks exposed to predator cues developed longer caudal peduncles

Abstract = {{There is a growing evidence that members of animal groups synchronize
   their vigilance behavior to minimize predation risk. Because
   synchronized vigilance deviates from the classical vigilance models,
   which assume independent scanning, it is important to understand when
   and why it occurs. We explored vigilance behavior of wild boar (Sus
   scrofa) in a population subject to spatial variation in human hunting
   risk and seasonal variation in food availability. Group members
   synchronized their vigilance behavior. We hypothesized that vigilance
   synchronization would be context dependent and the trade-off between
   energy gain and safety would shape the relationship between the degree
   of vigilance synchronization and group size. We predicted weaker
   synchronization in large groups under heavy predation risk, due to
   benefits of numerical dilution, and stronger synchronization in large
   groups when food is limiting, due to intense food competition. The
   degree of synchronization decreased with increasing group size in the
   area where human hunting added another risk factor to the natural
   predation, pointing at the safety benefits of vigilance synchrony for
   members of small groups and the role of human-induced risk in shaping
   vigilance synchrony. We found no relation between vigilance synchrony
   and group size in a food scarce, winter season. However, low levels of
   vigilance and its synchronization observed in winter indicated that
   energy gain was prioritized over safety. Thus, members of wild boar
   groups can adjust levels of vigilance and its synchronization depending
   on the forage-risk trade-off set by the ecological context.}},

Abstract = {{Generalist pollinators like the buff-tailed bumble bee, Bombus
   terrestris, encounter both nutrients and toxins in the floral nectar
   they collect from flowering plants. Only a few studies have described
   the gustatory responses of bees toward toxins in food, and these
   experiments have mainly used the proboscis extension response on
   restrained honey bees. Here, a new behavioral assay is presented for
   measuring the feeding responses of freely-moving, individual worker
   bumble bees to nutrients and toxins. This assay measures the amount of
   solution ingested by each bumble bee and identifies how tastants in food
   influence the microstructure of the feeding behavior.
   The solutions are presented in a microcapillary tube to individual
   bumble bees that have been previously starved for 2-4 hr. The behavior
   is captured on digital video. The fine structure of the feeding behavior
   is analyzed by continuously scoring the position of the proboscis
   (mouthparts) from video recordings using event logging software. The
   position of the proboscis is defined by three different behavioral
   categories: (1) proboscis is extended and in contact with the solution,
   (2) proboscis is extended but not in contact with the solution and (3)
   proboscis is stowed under the head. Furthermore the speed of the
   proboscis retracting away from the solution is also estimated.
   In the present assay the volume of solution consumed, the number of
   feeding bouts, the duration of the feeding bouts and the speed of the
   proboscis retraction after the first contact is used to evaluate the
   phagostimulatory or the deterrent activity of the compounds tested.
   This new taste assay will allow researchers to measure how compounds
   found in nectar influence the feeding behavior of bees and will also be
   useful to pollination biologists, toxicologists and neuroethologists
   studying the bumble bee's taste system.}},

Abstract = {{The migration strategy of many capital breeders is to garner body stores
   along the flyway at distinct stopover sites. The rate at which they can
   fuel is likely to be strongly influenced by a range of factors, such as
   physiology, food availability, time available for foraging and perceived
   predation. We analysed the foraging behaviour and fuel accumulation of
   pink-footed geese, an Arctic capital breeder, at their mid-flyway spring
   stopover site and evaluated to what extent their behaviour and fuelling
   were related to physiological and external factors and how it differed
   from other stopovers along the flyway. We found that fuel accumulation
   rates of geese at the mid-flyway site were limited by habitat
   availability rather than by digestive constraints. However, as the time
   available for foraging increased over the stopover season, geese were
   able to keep constant fuelling rate. Putting this in perspective, geese
   increased their daily net energy intake along the flyway corresponding
   to the increase in time available for foraging. The net energy intake
   per hour of foraging remained the same. Geese showed differences in
   their reaction to predators/disturbance between the sites, taking higher
   risks particularly at the final stopover site. Hence, perceived
   predation along the flyway may force birds to postpone the final fuel
   accumulation to the last stopover along the flyway. Flexibility in
   behaviour appears to be an important trait to ensure fitness in this
   capital breeder. Our findings are based on a new, improved method for
   estimating fuel accumulation of animals foraging in heterogeneous

   experimentally treated semi-free-ranging red-capped mangabeys

   subsequent changes in glucocorticoid production and individual
   behaviour. Because both parasites and stress impact energy balance and

   triplicate faecal samples (n = 441) from 49 individuals prior to and

   infection status, with uninfected individuals spending more time
   foraging and less time resting and vigilant compared with when they were
   infected. Time spent feeding, travelling or socializing did not differ
   between pre- and post-treatment time periods. Group cohesion, but not
   dominance stability, changed following treatment, suggesting
   parasite-induced social avoidance. Together, these findings show a

Title = {{The influence of maternal psychosocial characteristics on infant feeding
   styles}},
Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{396-402}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Maternal feeding styles in infancy and early childhood are associated
   with children's later risk for overweight and obesity. Maternal
   psychosocial factors that influence feeding styles during the
   complementary feeding period, the time during which infants transition
   from a milk-based diet to one that includes solid foods and other
   non-milk products, have received less attention. The present study
   explores how maternal psychosocial factors specifically self-esteem,
   parenting self-efficacy, parenting satisfaction, and depression symptoms
   influence mothers' infant feeding styles at nine months of age, a time
   during which solid foods eating habits are being established.
   Participants included 160 low-income, African-American mother-infant
   pairs in central North Carolina who were enrolled in the Infant Care and
   Risk of Obesity Study. Regression models tested for associations between
   maternal psychosocial characteristics and pressuring and restrictive
   feeding styles. Models were first adjusted for maternal age, education,
   marital status and obesity status. To account for infant
   characteristics, models were then adjusted for infant weight-for-length,
   distress to limitations and activity level scores. Maternal self-esteem
   was negatively associated with pressuring to soothe. Maternal parenting
   self-efficacy was positively associated with restriction-diet quality.
   Maternal parenting satisfaction and depression symptoms were not
   associated with feeding styles in the final models. Focusing on
   strengthening maternal self-esteem and parenting self-efficacy may help
   to prevent the development of less desirable infant feeding styles. (C)

Title = {{Behavioral measures of risk tasking, sensation seeking and sensitivity
   to reward may reflect different motivations for spicy food liking and
   consumption}},
Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{411-422}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Based on work a quarter century ago, it is widely accepted personality
   traits like sensation seeking are related to the enjoyment and intake of
   spicy foods; however, data supporting this belief is actually quite
   limited. Recently, we reported strong to moderate correlations between
   remembered spicy food liking and two personality traits measured with
   validated questionnaires. Here, participants consumed
   capsaicin-containing strawberry jelly to generate acute estimates of
   spicy food liking. Additionally, we used a laboratory-based behavioral
   measure of risk taking (the mobile Balloon Analogue Risk Task; mBART) to
   complement a range of validated self-report measures of risk-related
   personality traits. Present data confirm Sensation Seeking correlates
   with overall spicy meal liking and liking of the burn of a spicy meal,
   and extends prior findings by showing novel correlations with the liking
   of sampled stimuli. Other personality measures, including Sensitivity to
   Punishment (SP), Sensitivity to Reward (SR), and the Impulsivity and
   Risk Taking subscales of the DSM5 Personality Inventory (PID-5) did not
   show significant relationships with liking of spicy foods, either
   sampled or remembered. Our behavioral risk taking measure, the mBART,
   also failed to show a relationship with remembered or sampled liking.
   However, significant relationships were observed between reported intake
   of spicy foods and Sensitivity to Reward, and the Risk Taking subscale
   of the PID-5 (PID5-RT). Based on the observed patterns among various
   personality measures, and spicy food liking and intake, we propose that
   personality measures may exert their influence on intake of spicy food
   via different mechanisms. We also speculate that Sensation Seeking may
   reflect motivations for consuming spicy foods that are more intrinsic,
   while the motivations for eating spicy foods measured by SR and PID5-RT
   may be more extrinsic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic mechanisms are believed to link environmental exposures to
   gene expression, and in so doing, to provide a physical basis for the
   activation, by life experiences, of mental-health problems. This paper
   provides a background to the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms link
   life stresses (perinatal, childhood and adult) and effects of
   malnutrition to the eating disorders (EDs). The paper reviews literature
   bearing upon the putative link between epigenetic factors and ED
   development, and examines ways in which epigenetic alterations could
   account for risk of eating disturbances and commonly associated
   behavioral and emotional problems. Ultimately, we propose that
   epigenetic processes provide an intriguing (although hypothetical)
   biological ``platform{''} upon which ED-relevant effects of perinatal
   insults, life stresses, and consequences of malnutrition may be
   registered, and argue that an epigenetically informed understanding may
   explain why EDs are triggered and maintained by excessive caloric
   restraint, why they coincide so frequently with mood- and impulse
   regulation problems, and why they tend to become increasingly entrenched
   over time. Finally, we comment on the clinical relevance and
   implications of an epigenetically informed model of ED etiology. (C)

Abstract = {{By exploiting unutilized resources, organisms expand into novel niches,
   which can lead to adaptive radiation. However, some groups fail to
   diversify despite the apparent opportunity to do so. Although arising
   multiple times, arboreal folivores are rare and have not radiated,
   presumably because of energetic constraints. To explore this hypothesis,
   we quantified the field metabolic rate (FMR), movement, and body
   temperature for syntopic two-and three-toed sloths, extreme arboreal
   folivores that differ in their degree of specialization. Both species
   expended little energy, but three-toed sloths (162 kJ/day{*}kg(0.734))
   possessed the lowest FMR recorded for any mammal. Three-toed sloths were
   more heterothermic and moved less than two-toed sloths. We then compared
   FMRs and basal metabolic rates (BMRs) for 19 species of arboreal
   folivores along a spectrum of specialization. Overall, arboreal
   folivores had lower BMRs and FMRs than other mammals, and increasing
   specialization led to lower FMRs but not BMRs. Thus, reduced energetic
   expenditure in specialized species was the result of thermoregulatory
   and behavioral strategies, rather than simply a proportionate reduction
   in BMR. Altogether, our findings support the concept that arboreal
   folivores are tightly constrained by nutritional energetics and help to
   explain the lack of radiation among species exploiting a lifestyle in
   the trees.}},

Abstract = {{Although animals fine-tune their activity to avoid excess heat, we still
   lack a mechanistic understanding of such behaviors. As the global
   climate changes, such understanding is particularly important for
   projecting shifts in the activity patterns of populations and
   communities. We studied how foraging decisions vary with biotic and
   abiotic pressures. By tracking the foraging behavior of diurnal desert
   spiny mice in their natural habitat and estimating the energy and water
   costs and benefits of foraging, we asked how risk management and
   thermoregulatory requirements affect foraging decisions. We found that
   water requirements had the strongest effect on the observed foraging
   decisions. In their arid environment, mice often lose water while
   foraging for seeds and cease foraging even at high energetic returns
   when water loss is high. Mice also foraged more often when energy
   expenditure was high and for longer times under high seed densities and
   low predation risks. Gaining insight into both energy and water balance
   will be crucial to understanding the forces exerted by changing climatic
   conditions on animal energetics, behavior, and ecology.}},

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{632-639}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Territorial males may adopt a mating tactic that yields greater
   reproductive success but that at the same time increases the risk of
   predation. Plasticity in reproductive behavior can reflect a balance
   between sexual selection and natural selection. In this study, we sought
   to verify the effect of predation risk on territorial behavior of males
   of the solitary bee Ptilothrix fructifera (Apidae). Males of the species
   employ alternative mating tactics and can be territorial in defense of
   larval food sources. By manipulating predator models in the field, we
   tested whether (1) males avoid perch flowers containing predator models;
   (2) males alternate between mating tactics when their territory is
   associated with a predation risk; and (3) female foraging on flowers in
   a territory is altered in the presence of a predator model. We measured
   the responses of males and females in flowers containing and not
   containing a model of a spider or a stuffed bird. The results show that
   territorial males of P. fructifera alter their territorial behavior when
   faced with a high risk of predation. They do not abandon their territory
   or change to a non-territorial mating tactic, but instead change the use
   of their territory, avoiding flowers containing predator models or
   perching on other flowers when the previous flower presented a potential
   predation risk. Female P. fructifera decreases the frequency of their
   visits to flowers and the length of time spent there in the presence of
   a spider model. In short, in the face of predation risk, females and
   males alter their behaviors at the cost of less efficient foraging and
   searching for partners, respectively.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective The main objective of this study was to investigate the
   relationship between various factors (e.g., sociodemographic, child, and
   parental factors) and the healthfulness of parental responses to child
   in-store food purchasing requests. Additionally, a secondary objective
   is to describe ``resist strategies{''} used by parents to respond to
   child food-purchasing requests and their efficacy in avoiding conflict.
   Methods Parent-child dyads (children aged 2-6 years) completed an
   audio-/visual-recoded food shopping trip at their usual grocery store
   and time. Recordings of trips were coded for behavioral and
   environmental factors. Parental healthful response rate (i.e., percent
   of responses that were healthful) was the primary outcome variable. A
   healthful response occurred when a parent yielded to a healthful child
   request, or resisted a non-healthful request. Parents also completed a
   questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess the relationship
   between the main outcome variable and sociodemographic, child, and
   parent factors. Results Parents (n = 39) responded healthfully to 62.9
   \% (+/- 26.7 \%) of child food purchasing requests. Low- and
   middle-income parents, and black and white parents, had significantly
   higher healthful response rates compared to high-income parents (p =
   0.03) and Hispanic/Indian-descent parents (p = 0.02), respectively.
   Using the ``ignore{''} strategy proved an effective resist strategy in
   this study, leading to no parent-child conflicts. Conclusions
   Programming that seeks to improve the healthfulness of food purchasing
   in families with young children should address unhealthful response
   behaviors in Hispanic/Indian-descent parents and high-income parents;
   although, the needs of these groups are different. Further research is
   needed to confirm and expand on these findings.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{498-506}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Longer breastfeeding duration appears to have a protective
   effect against childhood obesity. This effect may be partially mediated
   by maternal feeding practices during the first years of life. However,
   the few studies that have examined links between breastfeeding duration
   and subsequent feeding practices have yielded conflicting results.
   Objective: Using a large sample of first-time mothers and a newly
   validated, comprehensive measure of maternal feeding (the Feeding
   Practices and Structure Questionnaire), this study examined associations
   between breastfeeding duration and maternal feeding practices at child
   age 24 months.
   Methods: Mothers (n = 458) enrolled in the NOURISH trial provided data
   on breastfeeding at child age 4, 14, and 24 months, and on feeding
   practices at 24 months. Structural equation modeling was used to examine
   associations between breastfeeding duration and 5 nonresponsive and 4
   structure-related authoritative feeding practices, adjusting for a range
   of maternal and child characteristics.
   Results: The model showed acceptable fit ((2)/df = 1.68; root mean
   square error of approximation = .04, comparative fit index = .91, and
   Tucker-Lewis index = .89) and longer breastfeeding duration was
   negatively associated with 4 out of 5 nonresponsive feeding practices
   and positively associated with 3 out of 4 structure-related feeding
   practices. Overall, these results suggest that mothers who breastfeed
   longer reported using more appropriate feeding practices.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrate an association between longer
   breastfeeding duration and authoritative feeding practices characterized
   by responsiveness and structure, which may partly account for the
   apparent protective effect of breastfeeding on childhood obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Theory-based predictions on asymmetries in animal contests have seldom
   been tested in situations where payoff asymmetries exist among
   contestants otherwise clearly matched for physical fighting capacity
   (i.e., resource holding potential, RHP). We examined the effects of food
   availability and predation risk on contest outcomes and the maintenance
   of dominance hierarchies in size-matched male noble crayfish pairs
   (Astacus astacus). Following theoretical predictions, dominant status
   established via contests staged in a non-resource context successfully
   predicted contest outcome (resource use) once resources were made
   available. Still, resource availability significantly increased the
   aggressive motivation of subordinates and sometimes resulted in
   hierarchy reversals. In subsequent resource-based contests, subordinates
   increased their fighting intensity, whereas dominants reduced their
   fighting motivation, potentially reflecting hunger-driven payoff
   asymmetries. Moreover, the data support the ``asset-protection{''}
   principle by showing for the first time that predation risk lowered the
   aggressive motivation of dominants. At the same time, the percentage of
   fighting bouts won by subordinates increased significantly, leading to
   reversal of prior dominance relationships in 30 \% of pairs. Compared to
   pairs where the hierarchy was retained through the different contests,
   pairs where dominance was reversed were characterized by smaller RHP
   asymmetries, which is again consistent with theory. These results show
   how animal contest behavior can be sensitive to the complex interactive
   effects of prior experience, resource value and RHP. Furthermore, in
   systems where repeated contests lead to dominance hierarchies, reversals
   within the hierarchy may occur more often when the RHP asymmetry between
   contestants is small.
   Contest outcome and resulting dominance status of contestants may be
   influenced by relative resource value and perceived costs involved in
   animal contests, especially when individuals are similar in major
   correlates of fighting ability, i.e., often body and weapon size.
   However, empirical evidence is scant. Using size-matched male crayfish
   pairs, we investigated the effects of food availability and predation
   threat on fighting behavior on individual and pair level and on
   hierarchy maintenance in repeated contests. Our study reveals novel
   evidence, indicating that crayfish are capable of changing their
   decisions during contests in response to food availability and predation
   threat, which can alter the hierarchy. For example, dominants reduced
   their aggressiveness in the presence of predation threat. Overall,
   hierarchy reversals were more likely in pairs where the difference in
   fighting ability between contestants was smaller.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of animals to find and consume hoarded seeds (i.e. seed
   recovery) is a key stage within the seed dispersal process. However, the
   ecology of seed recovery is still poorly understood. Here, we analyze
   the factors controlling seed recovery by scatter-hoarding rodents in an
   oak-dominated temperate forest. We examined the relative importance of
   intrinsic seed traits (i.e. plant-driven) and extrinsic seed factors
   (i.e. animal-driven) on the probability of seed recovery. We found that
   seed recovery is mainly driven by extrinsic seed factors, mostly related
   to animal behavior (pilfering frequency, microsite preference, predation
   risk, burial depth and cache size). Important intrinsic traits such as
   seed size, seed quality and seed-drop timing were, on average, of lower
   significance in the probability of seed recovery (2.8-times less
   important than extrinsic factors); only seed quality was an important
   intrinsic trait. On the other hand, larger and nutritionally more
   valuable seeds showed a removal-recovery tradeoff as they enhance seed
   removal and hoarding (increasing dispersal quality) but also favour seed
   recovery (increasing predation). We find that other mechanisms beyond
   seed traits (e.g. masting) are needed to decrease seed recovery and,
   thus, increase seed survival. We conclude that, as seed recovery is
   mostly driven by animal behavioural factors, it substantially differs
   from other previous stages of the seed dispersal process that are more
   dependent on seed traits. We argue that seed recovery needs further
   attention to advance our understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal
   and the role of secondary dispersers as a selective force for seeds.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Food subsidies have become a widely available and predictable resource
   in human-modified landscapes for many vertebrate species. Such resources
   can alter individual foraging behavior of animals, and induce
   population-wide changes. Yet, little consensus exists about the relative
   influence of the availabilities of native and human food subsidies to
   wildlife foraging throughout altered landscapes. We explored this
   unresolved question by analyzing the effects of landscape factors on
   American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet across the state of
   Colorado, USA. We estimated assimilated diet using stable isotope
   analysis of harvested black bear tissues to determine the contribution
   of human-derived foods to bear diets throughout Colorado, as well as how
   increasing reliance on human-derived food subsidies increases the risk
   of conflict. We found that bears (n = 296) showed strong regional diet
   variability, but substantial use of human-derived food subsidies in
   eastern Colorado (>30\% assimilated diet). The age-sex class of the bear
   and housing density of its harvest location were the most influential
   predictors of C-13 enrichment (a tracer of human food subsidies).
   Furthermore, foraging on subsidies increased risk of conflict; the odds
   of being a nuisance bear increased by 60\% for each similar to 1 parts
   per thousand increase in delta C-13. Our study confirms the efficacy of
   delta C-13 as a proxy for human activity, and indicates that while
   demographic differences play a clear role in the foraging ecology of
   bears, availability of subsidies coincident with varying levels of human
   activity appears to be a major driver in predicting black bear diet
   throughout the western United States. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The increase in size of human populations in urban and agricultural
   areas has resulted in considerable habitat conversion globally. Such
   anthropogenic areas have specific environmental characteristics, which
   influence the physiology, life history, and population dynamics of
   plants and animals. For example, the date of bud burst is advanced in
   urban compared to nearby natural areas. In some birds, breeding success
   is determined by synchrony between timing of breeding and peak food
   abundance. Pertinently, caterpillars are an important food source for
   the nestlings of many bird species, and their abundance is influenced by
   environmental factors such as temperature and date of bud burst. Higher
   temperatures and advanced date of bud burst in urban areas could advance
   peak caterpillar abundance and thus affect breeding phenology of birds.
   In order to test whether laying date advance and clutch sizes decrease
   with the intensity of urbanization, we analyzed the timing of breeding
   and clutch size in relation to intensity of urbanization as a measure of
   human impact in 199 nest box plots across Europe, North Africa, and the
   Middle East (i.e., the Western Palearctic) for four species of
   hole-nesters: blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tits (Parus major),
   collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and pied flycatchers
   (Ficedula hypoleuca). Meanwhile, we estimated the intensity of
   urbanization as the density of buildings surrounding study plots
   measured on orthophotographs. For the four study species, the intensity
   of urbanization was not correlated with laying date. Clutch size in blue
   and great tits does not seem affected by the intensity of urbanization,
   while in collared and pied flycatchers it decreased with increasing
   intensity of urbanization. This is the first large-scale study showing a
   species-specific major correlation between intensity of urbanization and
   the ecology of breeding. The underlying mechanisms for the relationships
   between life history and urbanization remain to be determined. We
   propose that effects of food abundance or quality, temperature, noise,
   pollution, or disturbance by humans may on their own or in combination
   affect laying date and/or clutch size.}},

Abstract = {{The management and recovery of large predator populations in areas where
   human persecution has driven them to ecological extinction requires a
   solid understanding of the effects of both predation and food limitation
   on prey populations. We used 11 yr of data on reported losses among 17.3
   million free-ranging sheep Ovis aries in the Norwegian farming industry
   to elucidate the relative roles of climate, vegetation characteristics,
   sheep densities, lamb body mass and densities of predators and
   alternative prey on the number of lambs and ewes lost on summer
   pastures. We first examined whether predator densities predicted autumn
   lamb body mass through possible impacts of predators on body growth
   (non-lethal effects) but found no evidence for such effects in our study
   system. This might be due to weak anti-predator behavioral responses in
   domesticated sheep. However, autumn lamb body mass was predicted by both
   sheep density and winter and spring weather conditions, probably through
   food availability. Losses of both lambs and ewes were positively and
   strongly related to the density of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, wolverine
   Gulo gulo and brown bear Ursus arctos. In addition, food availability
   and spring weather conditions were associated to losses of lambs, while
   precipitation in May predicted losses of ewes. There was little evidence
   for interaction effects of predator species on losses, suggesting that
   most of the effects of the predators were additive to each other. Given
   the strong effect of predator densities on sheep losses, we conclude
   that changing livestock husbandry practices towards a system that
   actively protects sheep and/or active management of predator densities
   may be necessary to reduce sheep losses where predators are
   recolonizing.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   The objective of this exploratory study was to determine whether fruit
   and vegetable consumption differed by race/ethnicity, by origin and
   nativity among Hispanics, and by language preference (as an indicator of
   acculturation) among foreign-born Hispanics.
   Methods
   We recruited 723 women enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition
   Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and orally administered a
   questionnaire containing demographic items, validated measures of food
   security status and social desirability trait, and the Behavioral Risk
   Factor Surveillance System fruit and vegetable module. Differences in
   intakes of 100\% fruit juice, fruit, cooked or canned beans, and dark
   green, orange-colored, and other vegetables were assessed by using
   analysis of covariance with Bonferroni post hoc tests. Analyses were
   controlled for age, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, food
   security status, educational attainment, and social desirability trait.
   Results
   The frequency of vegetable intake differed by race/ethnicity (cooked or
   canned beans were consumed more often among Hispanic than non-Hispanic
   black and non-Hispanic white or other participants, orange-colored
   vegetables were consumed more often among Hispanics than non-Hispanic
   black participants, and other vegetables were consumed more often among
   non-Hispanic white or other than among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic
   participants), origin (other vegetables were consumed more often among
   Columbian and other Hispanics than Dominican participants) and nativity
   (orange-colored vegetables were consumed more often among foreign-born
   than US-born Hispanics). Fruit and vegetable intake did not differ by
   language preference among foreign-born Hispanics.
   Conclusion
   Differences in fruit and vegetable consumption among WIC participants by
   race/ethnicity and by Hispanic origin and nativity may have implications
   for WIC nutrition policies and nutrition education efforts.}},

Title = {{Eating, feeding, and feeling: emotional responsiveness mediates
   longitudinal associations between maternal binge eating, feeding
   practices, and child weight}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although it is known that maternal disordered eating is
   related to restrictive feeding practices, there is little research
   exploring mechanisms for this association or its effects on other
   feeding practices. The purpose of this study was to assess whether
   maternal emotion responses mediate the association between maternal
   binge eating (BE) and child feeding practices, in order to identify
   potential risk factors for feeding practices that influence child
   weight.
   Methods: This longitudinal observational study included (n = 260)
   mothers and children from the STRONG Kids Panel Survey. At Wave 1,
   children were an average of 37 months old (SD = 6.9), and at Wave 2
   children were an average of 57 months old (SD = 8.3). Mothers
   self-reported their frequency of binge eating behavior (Wave 1),
   responses to children's negative emotions (Wave 1), feeding practices
   (Wave 1 and Wave 2), and child height and weight were measured at both
   time points. Using bias-corrected bootstrapping procedures, we tested
   the hypothesis that longitudinal associations between maternal BE and
   nonresponsive parent feeding practices would be mediated by parents'
   unsupportive responses to children's negative emotion. We also tested a
   serial mediation model positing that maternal BE predicts child body
   mass index (BMI) percentile change 18-24 months later, indirectly
   through unsupportive responses to negative emotion and nonresponsive
   feeding practices.
   Results: Maternal BE predicted use of more nonresponsive feeding
   practices (e.g. Emotion Regulation, Restriction for Health, Pressure to
   Eat, and Food as Reward), indirectly through more Distress responses to
   children's negative emotions. In the serial mediation model, maternal BE
   was associated with greater use of Distress responses, which indirectly
   predicted higher child BMI percentile through Food as Reward feeding
   practices.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that maternal eating and emotion
   responsiveness are important for understanding the interpersonal context
   of feeding behaviors, and child weight outcomes. Distress responses may
   serve as a risk factor for use of unhealthful feeding practices among
   mothers with BE and these responses may increase children's risk for
   weight gain.}},

Abstract = {{Factors such as temperature, habitat, larval density, food availability
   and food quality substantially affect organismal impact development. In
   addition, risk of predation has a complex on the behavioural and
   morphological life history responses of prey. Responses to predation
   risk seem to be mediated by physiological stress, which is an adaptation
   for maintaining homeostasis and improving survivorship during life
   threatening situations. We tested whether predator exposure during the
   larval phase of development has any influence on body elemental
   composition, energy reserves, body size, climbing speed and survival
   ability of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Fruit fly larvae were exposed
   to predation by jumping spiders (Phidippus apacheanus), and the
   percentage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, extracted lipids,
   escape response and survival were measured from predator-exposed and
   control adult flies. The results revealed predation as an important
   determinant of adult phenotype formation and survival ability. D.
   melanogaster reared together with spiders had a higher concentration of
   body N (but equal body C), a lower body mass and lipid reserves, a
   higher climbing speed and improved adult survival ability. The results
   suggest that the potential of predators to affect the development and
   the adult phenotype of D. melanogaster is high enough to use predators
   Jas a more natural stimulus in laboratory experiments when testing, for
   example, fruit fly memory and learning ability, or when comparing
   natural populations living under different predation pressures.}},

Abstract = {{The mammalian brain has evolved in close synchrony with the natural
   environment; consequently, trends toward disengagement from natural
   environments in today's industrialized societies may compromise adaptive
   neural responses and lead to psychiatric illness. Investigations of
   rodents housed in enriched environments indicate enhanced
   neurobiological complexity; yet, the origin of these stimuli, natural
   vs. manufactured, has not been sufficiently explored. In the current
   study, groups of rats were exposed to one of three environments: (1) a
   standard environment with only food and water, (2) an
   artificial-enriched environment with manufactured stimuli and (3) a
   natural-enriched environment with natural stimuli. Results indicated
   that, during the dark phase, natural-enriched animals exhibited longer
   durations interacting with objects than the artificial-enriched group;
   further, the natural-enriched group engaged in more social behavior than
   the other two groups. Both enriched groups exhibited less anxiety in
   response to a novel object but the natural-enriched rats exhibited less
   anxiety-typical behavior in response to a predator odor than the other
   groups. Less fos activation in the amygdala was observed in both
   enriched groups following a water escape task whereas an increase in fos
   activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed in the natural-enriched
   animals. Thus, the current findings indicate the potential importance of
   exposure to complex environments, especially naturallike habitats, in
   the maintenance of emotional health, perhaps providing a buffer against
   the emergence of anxiogenic responses. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Volume = {{283}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the amount of prey available is an important part of an
   animal's foraging behaviour. The risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts
   that an organism's foraging decisions with regard to food rewards
   depending upon its satiation level. However, the precise interaction
   between optimal risk-tolerance and satiation level remains unclear. In
   this study, we examined, firstly, whether cuttlefish, with one of the
   most highly evolved nervous system among the invertebrates, have number
   sense, and secondly, whether their valuation of food reward is satiation
   state dependent. When food such as live shrimps is present, without
   training, cuttlefish turn toward the prey and initiate seizure
   behaviour. Using this visual attack behaviour as a measure, cuttlefish
   showed a preference for a larger quantity when faced with
   two-alternative forced choice tasks (1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, 3 versus 4
   and 4 versus 5). However, cuttlefish preferred the small quantity when
   the choice was between one live and two dead shrimps. More importantly,
   when the choice was between one large live shrimp and two small live
   shrimps (a prey size and quantity trade-off), the cuttlefish chose the
   large single shrimp when they felt hunger, but chose the two smaller
   prey when they were satiated. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish
   are capable of number discrimination and that their choice of prey
   number depends on the quality of the prey and on their appetite state.
   The findings also suggest that cuttlefish integrate both internal and
   external information when making a foraging decision and that the cost
   of obtaining food is inversely correlated with their satiation level, a
   phenomenon similar to the observation that metabolic state alters
   economic decision making under risk among humans.}},

   BMI or body fat percentage, although neophobic children did have
   slightly lower weight and skeletal muscle mass than their neophilic

   adolescents presented a poorer quality of Mediterranean diet, due to a
   lower intake of fruit, vegetables, and fish, a higher intake of sweets

   more common among females than males, but its occurrence was similar

Abstract = {{Infants are born equipped to ingest nutrients, but have to learn what to
   eat. This must occur early, because the mode of feeding evolves
   dramatically, from ``tube{''} feeding in utero to eating family foods.
   Eating habits established during early years contribute to the
   development of subsequent eating habits. Therefore, it is fundamental to
   understand the most important early periods (between birth and 2 years,
   i.e. onset of food neophobia) for the development of eating habits and
   the drivers of this development. The role of pleasure in eating is
   central, especially during childhood when cognitive drivers of food
   choices may be less prominent than later in life. It is not easy to
   define and measure pleasure of eating in early childhood. However, it is
   possible to identify the characteristics of the eating experience which
   contribute to drive infant's eating and to shape preferences (food
   sensory properties; food rewarding properties; social context of
   eating). The learning processes involve repeated exposure (including to
   a variety of flavours), association with post-absorptive consequences
   and with contextual signals (including family members). The important
   early periods for learning food pleasure start being well identified.
   Beyond the first flavour discoveries during the prenatal and lactation
   periods (through the infant's exposure to flavours from foods of the
   mother's diet), the most important phase may be the beginning of
   complementary feeding. Infants discover the sensory (texture, taste and
   flavour) and nutritional properties (energy density) of the foods that
   will ultimately compose their adult diet; parents are still in charge of
   providing appropriate foods, timing, context for eating.
   Inter-individual differences in food pleasure learning, related to
   temperamental dimensions, or to sensory sensitivity also have to be
   taken into account. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory selection in thermal regimes that differed in the amplitude
   and the predictability of daily fluctuations had a marked effect on
   stress resistance and life history traits in Drosophila simulans. The
   observed evolutionary changes are expected to be the result of both
   direct and correlated responses to selection. Thus, a given trait might
   not evolve independently from other traits because of genetic
   correlations among these traits. Moreover, different test environments
   can induce novel genetic correlations because of the activation of
   environmentally dependent genes. To test whether and how genetic
   correlations among stress resistance and life history traits constrain
   evolutionary adaptation, we used three populations of D. simulans
   selected for 20 generations in constant, predictable and unpredictable
   daily fluctuating thermal regimes and tested each of these selected
   populations in the same three thermal regimes. We explored the
   relationship between genetic correlations between traits and the
   evolutionary potential of D. simulans by comparing genetic correlation
   matrices in flies selected and tested in different thermal test regimes.
   We observed genetic correlations mainly between productivity, body size,
   starvation and desiccation tolerance, suggesting that adaptation to the
   three thermal regimes was affected by correlations between these traits.
   We also found that the correlations between some traits such as body
   size and productivity or starvation tolerance and productivity were
   determined by test regime rather than selection regime that is expected
   to limit genetic adaptation to thermal regimes in these traits. The
   results of this study suggest that several traits and several
   environments are needed to explore adaptive responses, as genetic and
   environmentally induced correlations between traits as results obtained
   in one environment cannot be used to predict the response of the same
   population in another environment.}},

   should produce similar molecular patterns for various traits. To test
   this prediction, we used a laboratory model of vertebrate adaptive
   radiation to investigate the genetic basis of the response to selection
   for predatory behavior and compare it with evolution of aerobic capacity
   reported in an earlier work. After 13 generations of selection, the
   proportion of bank voles (Myodes {[}=Clethrionomys] glareolus) showing
   predatory behavior was five times higher in selected lines than in
   controls. We analyzed the hippocampus and liver transcriptomes and found
   repeatable changes in allele frequencies and gene expression. Genes with
   the largest differences between predatory and control lines are
   associated with hunger, aggression, biological rhythms, and functioning
   of the nervous system. Evolution of predatory behavior could be
   meaningfully compared with evolution of high aerobic capacity, because
   the experiments and analyses were performed in the same methodological
   framework. The number of genes that changed expression was much smaller
   in predatory lines, and allele frequencies changed repeatably in
   predatory but not in aerobic lines. This suggests thatmore variants of
   smaller effects underlie variation in aerobic performance, whereas fewer
   variants of larger effects underlie variation in predatory behavior. Our
   results thus contradict the view that comparable selection pressures for
   different quantitative traits produce similar molecular patterns.
   Therefore, to gain knowledge about molecular-level response to selection
   for complex traits, we need to investigate not only multiple replicate
   populations but also multiple quantitative traits.}},

Title = {{The multifaceted effects of starvation on arthropod behaviour}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Starvation is defined as a failure to consume food following an
   extrinsic limitation. By focusing on arthropods, I provide here a
   detailed review of how starvation affects foraging behaviour, predation
   avoidance, aggressive interactions and reproductive behaviour. Behaviour
   following starvation is shaped by the trade-off between the value of
   food, which increases with hunger level, and other vital needs, such as
   reproduction and avoiding ending up as prey. Foraging should take place
   as long as its marginal benefit outweighs the associated costs,
   including the avoidance of other important activities. Because
   starvation affects both the benefit and cost of foraging, it has various
   effects on behaviour. Most of the behaviours of hungry animals are
   selected to increase the likelihood of detecting food and better exploit
   it. The effect of starvation on foraging has usually revealed an
   increase in activity, albeit also occasionally a decrease, possibly due
   to a lowered metabolic rate or exhaustion. Predation avoidance becomes
   compromised when arthropods are hungry. Such hunger is also expressed in
   choosing riskier but prey-richer habitats and in not avoiding dangerous
   behaviours. Starvation elevates aggression and competition, as well as
   cannibalism. However, starved individuals are not necessarily more often
   victorious in such conflicts. Reproductive activities, such as male
   courting, female responsiveness and mating duration, decrease under
   starvation. An exception to this are females that gain material
   benefits, such as nuptial gifts, and which often increase their sexual
   activity in the face of starvation. I suggest that several behavioural
   responses to starvation follow a hump-shaped pattern, such as an
   increase followed by a decrease in foraging and aggression intensities
   with increasing hunger level. I highlight several research approaches,
   such as uncovering the link between starvation-induced changes in
   behaviour and fitness, and their underlying physiological mechanisms.

   individual and colony nutritional needs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{69-74}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of sociality is often accompanied by nutritional conflicts
   and the evolution of mechanisms to resolve them. The foraging behaviour
   of eusocial animals such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is generally
   considered to be largely regulated by the colony nutritional state.
   Previous work based on the information primacy hypothesis has however
   found that honeybee foragers explore (sample resources) and exploit
   (consume resources) in accordance with their individual nutritional
   state. We therefore hypothesized that individual and colony nutritional
   states differ in their influence on individuals of different behavioural
   phenotypes such as dancers and followers, who are akin to producers and
   scroungers, respectively. This leads to the prediction that these two
   behavioural groups will differ with respect to their
   exploration-exploitation trade-off and in terms of how they prioritize
   individual and colony nutritional states. We tested our predictions by
   creating a mismatch between individual and colony nutritional states.
   Our results show that dancers and followers do not differ in their
   levels of exploration and exploitation, but dancers are more responsive
   to colony nutritional state than are followers with regard to managing
   their exploration-exploitation trade-off. We discuss these results in
   the context of how these two behavioural phenotypes may differ in their
   sensitivity to the different nutritional pathways regulating worker
   behaviour in a eusocial colony and the evolution of sociality in
   general. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association

Abstract = {{Ghrelin, a peptide hormone produced by the stomach, is the endogenous
   ligand for the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR). Ghrelin acts
   on the GHSR to increase food intake, appetitive behaviors, and
   adiposity. Recently, a rat model with a null mutation to the GHSR gene
   (FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi)) was generated and used in behavioral studies, but
   the basic metabolic phenotype of this strain as well as that of the
   background strain (Fawn Hooded Hypertensive, FHH) has not been
   characterized in detail. Here we compared male FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats
   with their wild-type littermates (FHH-WT) in a number of metabolic
   parameters. In the 24 h of recovery following an acute overnight fast,
   FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats consumed less food than FHH-WT animals, and
   relative to their body weights, adult FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats consumed
   fewer calories when placed on a high fat diet. Despite this,
   FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats did not show a difference in diet-induced obesity
   or weight gain. Fasted FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats exhibited increased
   Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the
   Arcuate Nucleus (ARC), indicative of altered central regulation of
   feeding and energy balance. FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats exhibited lower
   levels of home cage locomotor behavior over the entire light/dark cycle,
   and reduced levels of food anticipatory activity when placed on a
   restricted feeding schedule. Finally, FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rats consumed
   less of a palatable dessert (cookie dough) given after the completion of
   the scheduled meal. Altogether, our data show that rats lacking a
   functional GHSR tend to eat less than their wild type counterparts in
   the face of acute fasts, chronic high-fat diet exposure, and exposure to
   a palatable dessert, despite not showing differences in body weight and
   glucose homeostasis that are characteristic of GHSR null mice. These
   data indicate that many, but not all responses to GHSR ablation are
   conserved between rats and mice. The FHH-GHSR(m1/MCWi) rat thus
   represents a novel and useful model for studying GHSR function in rats.

Abstract = {{Plants make foraging decisions that are dependent on ecological

   know little about what factors impact plant behavior, especially
   light-foraging behavior. We made use of the behavioral reaction norm
   approach to investigate light foraging in a plant species that exhibits
   rapid movement: Mimosa pudica. We explored how herbivore avoidance
   behavior in M. pudica (which closes its leaflets temporarily when
   disturbed) is affected by an individual's energy state and the quality
   of the current environment and also repeatedly tested the behavior of
   individuals from two seed sources to determine whether individuals
   exhibit a ``personality{''} (i.e., behavioral syndrome). We found that
   when individuals are in a low-energy state, they adopt a riskier
   light-foraging strategy, opening leaflets faster, and not closing
   leaflets as often in response to a disturbance. However, when plants are
   in a high-energy state, they exhibit a plastic light-foraging strategy
   dependent on environment quality. Although we found no evidence that
   individuals exhibit behavioral syndromes, we found that individuals from
   different seed sources consistently behave differently from each other.
   Our results suggest that plants are capable of making state-dependent
   decisions and that plant decision making is complex, depending on the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{300}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the last decade, an increasing body of research has addressed the
   extent to which different individuals within a species or population
   specialize in their exploitation of different food resources, which is
   referred to as individual diet specialization (IDS). Traditionally,
   researchers use the terms specialist' and generalist', despite the
   inability of these labels to capture all of the complexity of IDS. In
   this paper, we compare the dietary specialism of great tit Parus major
   and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus at different temporal and spatial
   scales. We use these two species to illustrate the differences within
   and between species in individual levels of IDS. Both of these species
   show greater IDS in Mediterranean habitats, where resources are less
   plentiful and more variable than in Northern Europe. Additionally, we
   also emphasize that IDS within populations may change temporally. At the
   same time, there are differences between species, with great tits
   showing a higher capacity than blue tits to specialize at both the
   individual and the population level. Great tits can be considered
   generalists at the species level and specialists at the individual
   level, while blue tits can be considered generalists at both the species
   and the individual level. Our study demonstrates that there is a need
   for researchers to determine the relative importance of intrinsic
   factors (e.g. differences between species or individuals in their
   behavioral flexibility or cognitive capacity) and extrinsic factors
   (e.g. resource base) in shaping patterns of dietary specialization. We
   conclude that, within and among species, different individuals respond
   differently to similar environmental pressures, utilize different niches
   and develop different functions in the ecosystem depending on their type
   of IDS. Therefore, we propose that label generalists' should distinguish
   between facultative generalists, which can develop new specializations,
   and obligate generalists, which have a limited capacity to develop novel
   specializations.}},

Pages = {{428-436}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Some anthropogenic noise is now considered pollution, with evidence
   building that noise from human activities such as transportation,
   construction and exploration can impact behaviour and physiology in a
   broad range of taxa. However, relatively little research has considered
   the effects of repeated or chronic noise; extended exposures may result
   in habituation or sensitisation, and thus changes in response. We
   conducted a field-based experiment at Moorea Island to investigate how
   repeated exposure to playback of motorboat noise affected a coral reef
   fish (Dascyllus trimaculatus). We found that juvenile D. trimaculatus
   increased hiding behaviour during motorboat noise after two days of
   repeated exposure, but no longer did so after one and two weeks of
   exposure. We also found that naive individuals responded to playback of
   motorboat noise with elevated ventilation rates, but that this response
   was diminished after one and two weeks of repeated exposure. We found no
   strong evidence that baseline blood cortisol levels, growth or body
   condition were affected by three weeks of repeated motorboat noise
   playback. Our study reveals the importance of considering how tolerance
   levels may change over time, rather than simply extrapolating from
   results of short-term studies, if we are to make decisions about
   regulation and mitigation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Different phenological responses to climate changes by species

   the little auk (Alle alle) in two large colonies in Hornsund and
   Magdalenefjorden, Spitsbergen, differing in synchrony of breeding
   (11-day vs. 22-day hatching period, respectively). Assuming similar
   zooplankton phenology and existing differences in duration of the little
   auk breeding period, we expected lower availability of the preferred
   food in the less synchronized colony in Magdalenefjorden and in
   consequence a negative effect on nestling body mass and survival. We
   found that in both colonies Calanus glacialis (copepodite stage CV) was
   the most important prey item in the chick diet making up 68-87 \% of the
   biomass and energy of all prey items. The only exception was the end of
   the chick-rearing period in Magdalenefjorden, when contribution of this
   prey item was significantly lower (24-26 \%). Thus, late breeders in
   Magdalenefjorden were apparently mismatched regarding C. glacialis CV
   availability. However, the hatching date did not affect birds fitness
   (reproductive output and chick pre-fledging mass) significantly. Results
   of our study indicate that little auks breeding on Spitsbergen can
   respond to a wide range of environmental conditions and prey
   availabilities through the plasticity of their foraging behaviour, which
   may help them to maintain their optimum fitness level in changing and

Abstract = {{In marine ecosystems, primary productivity and consequently food
   availability for higher trophic levels are often strongly affected by
   the water temperature. Thus, differences in sea surface temperatures

   monitoring of chick growth rates and chick survival, we here attempted a
   comprehensive assessment of the effects of inter-annual environmental
   variability as indicated by SST and chlorophyll a (reflecting primary
   productivity) data. Inter-annual differences in environmental variables
   around our study colony on New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands,
   contradicted the general expectation, with higher chlorophyll a
   concentrations coinciding with higher spring SST in 2010/2011 compared
   to 2009/2010. Penguins foraged further away from the colony during guard
   and creche in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010, while performing deeper
   dives in 2009/2010. Stable isotope mixing models suggested a
   crustacean-dominated chick diet in 2009/2010, compared to a mixture of
   squid and fish in 2010/2011. These differences in foraging behaviour and
   diet, however, had no consequences for chick growth rates or chick
   survival and thus had no apparent effect on population trajectories.
   Potentially, environmental conditions in both years could still be seen
   as favourable compared to other years and breeding sites, enabling the

Abstract = {{Information on where to find food patches, their quality, and food

   variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by

   investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new
   patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an
   alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express
   variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted
   that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current
   information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we
   designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to
   changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits Parus

Abstract = {{Following bacterial infection spreads in a population, individuals show

   melanogaster-bacterial pathogen system was used to unravel how

   restricted diets. Life-history traits and fecundity of D. melanogaster
   were assessed under healthy and disease conditions. Marked differences
   were observed between half of the Drosophila lines and the heterogeneous

   survival percentage and development time in all lines, indicating lack
   of phenotypic plasticity under healthy conditions. However, following
   bacterial infection, the significant differences among the Drosophila
   life-history traits due to lines and bacterial strains demonstrated
   phenotypic plasticity and genotype-by- environment interaction on
   standard diet. By combining the two environmental factors (diet regime
   and treatment) together with the lines, D. melanogaster showed
   significant difference of the survival percentage due to Pectobacterium

   by genotype, diet and treatment. The fecundity showed a general
   reduction following infection or diet restriction exposure. The results
   of reaction norms of Drosophila survival percentage, development time

Abstract = {{Environmental constraints are strong in migratory species that breed in

   nesting species. We used a database of 1412 moulting adult females
   measured over 15 yr on Bylot Island, Nunavut. Ninth (9th) primary length
   was used to determine the moult stage and speed of feather growth. We
   found a positive relationship between median annual hatching and moult

   between hatching and moult initiation was thus rather fixed and geese
   did not initiate moult earlier when reproductive phenology was delayed.
   Nonetheless, there was no relationship between median hatching date and
   the date at which birds regained flight capacity, suggesting that date
   of end of moult is independent of the reproductive phenology. There was
   a trend for an increase in the speed of flight feather growth in years

   explain moult phenology adjustment in this species. Finally, we found a

   inter-annual variations) and body condition, suggesting a delay in
   moulting for individuals in poor condition. These results suggest that
   moult plasticity is primarily governed by variations in feather growth
   speed. This phenotypic plasticity could be necessary to complete flight
   feather renewal before the end of the arctic summer, independently of
   reproductive phenology and spring environmental conditions. Our novel
   results suggest possible phenological adjustments through moult speed,
   which was considered constant in geese until now.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and evolutionary processes commonly result in morphological
   variation among larval amphibians. Variation in head shape plays a
   critical role in both food capture and predation risk in gape-limited
   salamanders, yet in situ studies of head shape variability are rare
   outside of cannibal morph assessments. We examined allometry differences
   in larval head width (HW) and snout-vent length (SVL) among three
   sympatric species of ambystomatid salamanders from 166 ponds in
   Missouri, USA: Ringed Salamander (Ambystoma annulatum), Marbled
   Salamander (A. opacum), and Spotted Salamander (A. maculatum). We also
   tested whether several abiotic and biotic factors would predict HW after
   accounting for SVL. We found that larval HW and SVL were strongly
   correlated for all species but that the strength of this relationship
   varied among species. For early-stage larvae, Marbled Salamanders showed
   isometric scaling relationships, whereas both Spotted Salamanders and
   Ringed Salamanders were allometric. For late-stage larvae, all three
   species showed allometric patterns. At a small SVL, HW of small Ringed
   Salamanders was greater than the other species. As larvae increased in
   SVL, Marbled Salamander HW increased most rapidly and eventually
   exceeded both Ringed Salamanders and Spotted Salamanders of a similar
   size. We also found that both abiotic and biotic factors predicted
   significant differences in HW corrected for SVL among species, including
   predator density, competitor density, and hydroperiod. Overall,
   variability in scaling relationships may provide ecological advantages
   to each species at different points in ontogeny and different biotic and
   abiotic factors may induce such variation in asymmetric ways among
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Conifer bark beetles attack and kill mature spruce and pine trees,
   especially during hot and dry conditions. These beetles are closely
   associated with ophiostomatoid fungi of the Ascomycetes, including the
   genera Ophiostoma, Grosmannia, and Endoconidiophora, which enhance
   beetle success by improving nutrition and modifying their substrate, but
   also have negative impacts on beetles by attracting predators and
   parasites. A survey of the literature and our own data revealed that
   ophiostomatoid fungi emit a variety of volatile organic compounds under
   laboratory conditions including fusel alcohols, terpenoids, aromatic
   compounds, and aliphatic alcohols. Many of these compounds already have
   been shown to elicit behavioral responses from bark beetles, functioning
   as attractants or repellents, often as synergists to compounds currently
   used in bark beetle control. Thus, these compounds could serve as
   valuable new agents for bark beetle management. However, bark beetle
   associations with fungi are very complex. Beetle behavior varies with
   the species of fungus, the stage of the beetle life cycle, the host tree
   quality, and probably with changes in the emission rate of fungal
   volatiles. Additional research on bark beetles and their symbiotic
   associates is necessary before the basic significance of ophiostomatoid
   fungal volatiles can be understood and their applied potential realized.}},

Abstract = {{The sexes differ in how and when they allocate energy towards

   activity patterns is unclear. Here, we use collar-mounted light loggers
   and triaxial accelerometers to examine factors that affect time spent
   above ground and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), an index of
   activity-specific energy expenditure, across the active season of
   free-living, semi-fossorial arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus
   parryii). We found high day-to-day variability in time spent above
   ground and ODBA with most of the variance explained by environmental
   conditions known to affect thermal exchange. In both years, females
   spent more time below ground compared with males during parturition and
   early lactation; however, this difference was fourfold larger in the
   second year, possibly, because females were in better body condition.
   Daily ODBA positively correlated with time spent above ground in both
   sexes, but females were more active per unit time above ground.
   Consequently, daily ODBA did not differ between the sexes when
   femaleswere early in lactation, even though females were above ground
   three to six fewer hours each day. Further, on top of having the
   additional burden of milk production, ODBA data indicate females also
   had fragmented rest patterns and were more active during late lactation.
   Our results indicate that sex differences in reproductive requirements
   can have a substantial influence on activity patterns, but the size of
   this effect may be dependent on capital resources accrued during
   gestation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) and National Centre
   for the Replacement, Refinement \& Reduction of Animals in Research
   (NC3Rs) conducted a survey and workshop in 2015 to define current
   industry practices relating to housing of non-rodents during telemetry
   recordings in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. The aim was to
   share experiences, canvas opinion on the study procedures/designs that
   could be used and explore the barriers to social housing.
   Methods: Thirty-nine sites, either running studies (Sponsors or Contract
   Research Organisations, CROs) and/or outsourcing work responded to the
   survey (51\% from Europe; 41\% from USA).
   Results: During safety pharmacology studies, 84, 67 and 100\% of
   respondents socially house dogs, minipigs and non-human primates (NHPs)
   respectively on non-recording days. However, on recording days 20, 20
   and 33\% of respondents socially house the animals, respectively. The
   main barriers for social housing were limitations in the recording
   equipment used, study design and animal temperament/activity. During
   toxicology studies, 94, 100 and 100\% of respondents socially house
   dogs, minipigs and NHPs respectively on non-recording days. However, on
   recording days 31, 25 and 50\% of respondents socially house the
   animals, respectively. The main barriers for social housing were risk of
   damage to and limitations in the recording equipment used, food
   consumption recording and temperament/activity of the animals.
   Conclusions: Although the majority of the industry does not yet socially
   house animals during telemetry recordings in safety pharmacology and
   toxicology studies, there is support to implement this refinement.
   Continued discussions, sharing of best practice and data from companies
   already socially housing, combined with technology improvements and
   investments in infrastructure are required to maintain the forward
   momentum of this refinement across the industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{248-255}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The purpose of this study was to examine weight loss, physical activity,
   fitness and diet changes in response to a standard behavioral weight
   loss intervention in adults with self-reported juvenile onset (n = 61)
   or adult onset (n = 116) obesity.
   Methods
   Participants (n = 177; 43.0 +/- 8.6 years; body mass index {[}BMI] =
   33.0 +/- 3.4 kg m(-2)) engaged in an 18-month standard behavioral weight
   loss intervention. Participants were randomized into three different
   intervention groups as part of the larger parent trial. BMI, physical
   activity, fitness and diet were assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 18
   months. Separate adjusted mixed models were constructed using SAS
   version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
   Results
   There was significant weight loss, increased physical activity, improved
   fitness and reduced caloric intake over time (p<0.001). There were no
   significant differences in these outcome variables by obesity onset
   group. However, there was a significant group by time interaction for
   fitness (p = 0.001), with the adult onset making significantly greater
   gains in fitness from baseline to 6 months (p<0.001); however, this
   difference was no longer present at 12 or 18 months.
   Conclusions
   With the exception of fitness at 6 months, weight loss, physical
   activity and diet did not differ between juvenile onset and adult onset
   participants, suggesting that those with juvenile onset obesity are
   equally responsive to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in
   adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Stress responses are suggested to physiologically underlie parental
   decisions promoting the redirection of behaviour away from offspring
   care when survival is jeopardized (e.g., when facing a predator).
   Besides this classical view, the ``brood-value hypothesis{''} suggests
   that parents' stress responses may be adaptively attenuated to increase
   fitness, ensuring continued breeding when the relative value of the
   brood is high. Here, we test the brood-value hypothesis in breeding king
   penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), long-lived seabirds for which the
   energy commitment to reproduction is high. We subjected birds at
   different breeding stages (courtship, incubation and chick brooding) to
   an acute 30-min capture stress and measured their hormonal
   (corticosterone, CORT) and metabolic (non-esterified fatty acid, NEFA)
   responses to stress. We found that CORT responses were markedly
   attenuated in chick-brooding birds when compared to earlier stages of
   breeding (courtship and incubation). In addition, NEFA responses
   appeared to be rapidly attenuated in incubating and brooding birds, but
   a progressive increase in NEFA plasma levels in courting birds suggested
   energy mobilization to deal with the threat. Our results support the
   idea that stress responses may constitute an important life-history
   mechanism mediating parental reproductive decisions in relation to their
   expected fitness outcome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a
   phloem-feeding insect whose antipredator defenses include kicking,
   walking away, and dropping from the plant. Aphid dropping, a risky and
   energetically costly antipredator behavior, can be increased by the
   release of aphid alarm pheromone; there is also evidence that insect
   density and plant health can affect the likelihood of aphids engaging in
   this behavior. We investigated whether interactions between alarm cues,
   insect density, and plant health can alter the dropping behavior of
   aphids in response to an artificial disturbance. The presence of the
   alarm pheromone E-beta-farnesene resulted in a nearly 15-fold increase
   in aphid dropping behavior; the other two factors, however, did not
   affect dropping and none of the two-or three-way interactions were
   significant. This was surprising because aphids affected plant health:
   production of new plant biomass after 5 d of exposure to high aphid
   densities was 50\% lower than in the control treatment. This research
   adds to our understanding of the factors affecting aphid antipredator
   behavior; the fact that neither aphid density nor feeding period
   impacted dropping may reflect the high energetic costs of this activity
   and an unwillingness to use it in any but the riskiest situations.}},

Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: The first 2 years of life is a critical period of rapid
   growth and brain development. During this period, nutrition and
   environmental factors play important roles in growth and cognitive
   development of a child. This report describes the study protocol of
   early nutrition, growth and cognitive development of infants from birth
   to 2 years of age.
   Methods/Design: This is a prospective cohort study of mothers and
   infants recruited from government health clinics in Seremban district in
   Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Infants are followed-up at 6, 12, 18 and 24
   months of age. Pre-natal factors that include mother's pre-pregnancy
   body mass index, gestational weight gain, blood glucose and blood
   pressure during pregnancy, infant's gestational age, birth weight and
   head circumference at birth are obtained from patient card. Post-natal
   factors assessed at each follow-up are feeding practices, dietary
   intake, anthropometric measurements and cognitive development of
   infants. Iron status is assessed at 6 months, while infant temperament
   and home environment are assessed at 12 months. Maternal intelligence is
   assessed at 18 months.
   Discussion: Early life nutritional programming is of current interest as
   many longitudinal studies are actively being conducted in developed
   countries to investigate this concept. The concept however is relatively
   new in developing countries such as Malaysia. This study will provide
   useful information on early nutrition and infant development in the
   first two years of life which can be further followed up to identify
   factors that track into childhood and contribute to growth and cognitive
   deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Historical patterns of wildfires are being altered as a result of
   changing climate and therefore are becoming an increasingly pressing
   global issue. How small mammals deal physiologically with changes in
   landscape and food availability due to fire remains largely unknown,
   although recent studies on small heterothermic terrestrial mammals have
   shown an increase in post-fire torpor use to reduce energy and foraging
   requirements. However, data on the behavioural and physiological
   responses of bats after fires are scarce, although potentially these
   volant species may differ from terrestrial mammals. Therefore, we
   investigated the post-fire thermal biology and activity of lesser
   long-eared bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) using temperature-telemetry in
   Warrumbungle National Park, NSW, which experienced a devastating
   wildfire in 2013. The study comprised two field seasons, one in 2013
   within 4 months after the fire, and one in 2015 two years after the fire
   to identify potential changes in behaviour and physiology.
   Interestingly, soon after the fire, bats showed significantly shorter
   torpor bout duration (11.8 +/- A 12.5 h) and longer normothermia
   duration (8.7 +/- A 4.6 h) in comparison to those in 2015 (torpor bout
   duration: 24.1 +/- A 23.5 h; normothermia duration: 2.5 +/- A 1.5 h).
   Insect availability was significantly (20-fold) higher in 2013 than in
   2015, which was likely an important factor resulting in the short
   average torpor bout duration by N. geoffroyi after the fire. Our data
   indicate that volant bats appear to show the opposite post-fire
   behavioural and physiological responses to small terrestrial mammals,
   showing longer normothermic and active periods and shorter torpor bouts
   to capitalise on an increase in available post-fire resources.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{164}},
Number = {{A}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that individuals with higher metabolic rates
   (MRs) feed at higher rates and are more willing to forage in the
   presence of predators. This increases the acquisition of resources,
   which in turn, may help to sustain a higher MR. Elevated predation
   danger may be expected to result in reduced MRs, either as a means of
   allowing for reduced feeding and risk-taking, or as a consequence of
   adaptively reducing intake rates via reduced feeding and/or risk-taking.
   We tested this prediction in free-living great tits (Parus major) using
   a playback experiment to manipulate perceived predation danger. There
   was evidence that changes in body mass and BMR differed as a function of
   treatment. In predator treatment plots, great tits tended to reduce
   their body mass, a commonly observed response in birds to increased
   predation danger. In contrast, birds from control treatment plots showed
   no overall changes in body mass. There was also evidence that great tits
   from control treatment plots increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR)
   over the course of the experiment, presumably due to decreasing ambient
   temperatures over the study period. However, there was no evidence for
   changes in BMR for birds from predator treatment plots. Although the
   directions of these results are consistent with the predicted directions
   of effects, the effects sizes and confidence intervals yield
   inconclusive support for the hypothesis that great tits would adaptively
   suppress BMR in response to increased perceived predation risk. The
   effect size observed in the present study was small (similar to 1\%) and
   would not be expected to result in substantive reductions in feeding
   rate and/or risk-taking. Whether or not ecological conditions that
   generate greater energetic stress (e.g. lower food availability, lower
   ambient temperatures) could produce an effect that produces biologically
   meaningful reductions in feeding activity and/or risk-taking remains an
   open question. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   there was no hunting but deer were exposed to increased risk of severe
   food depletion; and on one, deer had access to abundant food but were
   exposed to a few days of hunting each year. Based on the context of the
   study, we tentatively predicted that FGM levels would be higher in low
   food abundance/safe islands. We also predicted that FGM levels would be
   higher in winter when food is rarer, particularly in low food
   abundance/safe islands. The three deer populations presented similar
   average FGM levels and seasonal variations. Our predictions were
   therefore not supported. Our results rather suggested that environmental
   contrasts, perceived by us as large (increased risk of starvation on ELI
   and Kunga islands) or associated with differences in animal behavior
   (human avoidance on Reef island), did not lead to increased stress
   responses. We discuss plausible explanations, including the
   down-regulation of the stress response in depleted environments and the
   lack of stress response to low hunting pressure when behavioral
   responses to risk are unlikely to be costly.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a most common neurodegenerative disorder,
   which associates with impaired cognition. Gut microbiota can modulate
   host brain function and behavior via microbiota-gut-brain axis,
   including cognitive behavior. Germ-free animals, antibiotics, probiotics
   intervention and diet can induce alterations of gut microbiota and gut
   physiology and also host cognitive behavior, increasing or decreasing
   risks of AD. The increased permeability of intestine and blood-brain
   barrier induced by gut microbiota disturbance will increase the
   incidence of neurodegeneration disorders. Gut microbial metabolites and
   their effects on host neurochemical changes may increase or decrease the
   risk of AD. Pathogenic microbes infection will also increase the risk of
   AD, and meanwhile, the onset of AD support the ``hygiene hypothesis{''}.
   All the results suggest that AD may begin in the gut, and is closely
   related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. Modulation of gut microbiota
   through personalized diet or beneficial microbiota intervention will
   probably become a new treatment for AD.}},

   white-tailed deer?}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Predators can have powerful nonconsumptive effects on their prey by
   inducing behavioral, physiological, and morphological responses. These
   nonconsumptive effects may influence prey demography if they decrease
   birthrates or increase susceptibility to other sources of mortality. The
   Reproductive Suppression Model suggests that iteroparous species may
   maximize their lifetime reproductive success by suppressing their
   reproduction until a future time, when conditions may be more favorable.
   Coyote (Canis latrans) range expansion in the United States has exposed
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations to increased
   predation risk, and coyote predation can have profound effects on
   white-tailed deer reproductive success. We evaluated effects of temporal
   variation in predation risk (i.e., coyote-deer ratios) on fecundity and
   reproductive success of white-tailed deer on the Joseph W. Jones
   Ecological Research Center in southwestern Georgia, United States, by
   exploiting a rapid decline in coyote abundance to establish a natural
   experiment. We measured fecundity by examining ovaries for evidence of
   ovulation, and measured reproductive success using evidence of lactation
   from deer harvested before and after the decline in coyote abundance. We
   found that incidence of ovulation and lactation increased following the
   decline in predation risk. Our results suggest coyotes may be able to
   influence deer recruitment, independent of direct predation, through
   interactions that result in reduced fecundity. More broadly, our study
   suggests that in order to understand the totality of the effect of
   predators on prey population dynamics, studies should incorporate
   measures of direct and indirect predator effects.}},

Abstract = {{Birds' responses to human disturbance are interesting due to their
   similarities to anti-predator behaviour, and understanding this
   behaviour has practical applications for conservation management by
   informing measures such as buffer zones to protect priority species. To
   understand better the costs of disturbance and whether it will impact on
   population size, studies should quantify time-related responses as well
   as the more commonly reported flight initiation distance (FID). Using
   waders wintering on an estuarine area, we experimentally disturbed
   foraging birds on the Wash Embayment, UK, by walking towards them and
   recording their responses (FID, alert time, time spent in flight, time
   taken to resume feeding, and total feeding time lost). We present data
   for 10 species of conservation concern: Curlew Numenius arquata,
   Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica,
   Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Redshank Tringa totanus, Knot Calidris
   canutus, Turnstone Arenaria interpres, Ringed Plover Charadrius
   hiaticula, Sanderling Calidris alba and Dunlin Calidris alpina. Larger
   species responded more strongly, response magnitude was greater under
   milder environmental conditions, and responses varied over both small
   and large spatial scales. The energetic costs of individual responses,
   however, were low relative to daily requirements and disturbance events
   were unlikely to be frequent enough to seriously limit foraging time. We
   suggest, therefore, that wintering wader populations on the Wash are not
   currently significantly negatively impacted by human disturbance during
   the intertidal foraging period. This is also likely to be the case at
   other estuarine sites with comparable access levels, visitor patterns,
   invertebrate food availability and environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Non-breeding Cackling Branta hutchinsii, Ross's Anser rossii and Lesser
   Snow Geese Anser caerulescens caerulescens captured during remigial
   moult on Baffin Island in 2015 showed no loss of body mass with moult

   captured geese of all three species were likely to have been
   non-breeding individuals that initiated moult early, whereas there were
   almost no failed or successful breeders, which would normally moult
   later. This suggests that in a non-breeding year (i.e. in the absence of
   competition from large numbers of goslings), locally moulting geese can
   obtain sufficient exogenous energy to meet their needs during the
   flightless wing moult period without losing body mass. This also is
   consistent with the hypothesis that in other species of geese,
   accumulation of fat stores prior to, and depletion of such stores
   during, wing moult is adaptive and likely to be a feature of individual
   plasticity to meet particular needs, such as undertaking moult migration

Abstract = {{Objective: Food fussiness (FF), or the frequent rejection of both
   familiar and unfamiliar foods, is common among children and, given its
   link to poor diet quality, may contribute to the onset and/or
   maintenance of childhood obesity. This study examined child FF in
   association with anthropometric variables and diet in children with
   overweight/obesity participating in family-based behavioral weight loss
   treatment (FBT). Change in FF was assessed in relation to FBT outcome,
   including whether change in diet quality mediated the relation between
   change in FF and change in child weight.
   Methods: Child (N=170; age=9.41 +/- 1.23) height and weight were
   measured, and parents completed FF questionnaires and three 24-h recalls
   of child diet at baseline and post-treatment. Healthy Eating Index-2005
   scores were calculated.
   Results: At baseline, child FF was related to lower vegetable intake.
   Average child FF decreased from start to end of FBT. Greater decreases
   in FF were associated with greater reductions in child body mass index
   and improved overall diet quality. Overall, diet quality change through
   FBT mediated the relation between child FF change and child body mass

   Conclusions: Children with high FF can benefit from FBT, and addressing

Abstract = {{Background: Coeliac disease (CD) is managed by life-long adherence to a

   Patient involvement through shared decision-making is central to
   behaviour-change skills used by dietitians, although there is little

   The present study aimed to explore patients' preferences for diet and

   carers of children with CD were invited through support networks.
   Participants took part in a telephone, face-to-face interview or focus
   group which was audio-recorded and transcribed. Themes were developed
   using a framework method. Ethical approval was obtained. Results:
   Twenty-nine adult patients and five parents of CD children participated
   0-34 years after diagnosis. Four main outcome-related themes emerged:
   (i) Participants wanted information specific to their lifestyle and time
   since diagnosis, focussing on food containing gluten, practical issues,
   prescribable items and general nutrition. (ii) The degree of
   satisfaction with the consultation process impacted on participants'
   experience, including the dietitian's CD expertise, consistency of the
   dietitian seen, and the frequency and length of appointments. (iii)
   Health concerns were important to participants and focussed on risk of
   osteoporosis, unwanted weight gain, and the fat and sugar content of
   manufactured gluten-free products. (iv) Clinical monitoring, including
   bone scans and antibody measurements, was mentioned but was not
   described as being of importance for most participants. Conclusions: The
   outcomes preferred by CD patients and carers focussed primarily on

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{217-222}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The prevalence of consistent among-individual differences in behaviour,
   or personality, makes adaptive sense if individuals differ in stable
   state variables that shift the balance between the costs and benefits of
   their behavioural decisions. These differences may give rise to both
   individual differences in, and covariance among, behaviours that
   influence an individual's exposure to risks. We here study the link
   between behaviour and a candidate state variable previously overlooked
   in the study of state-dependent personality variation: telomere length.
   Telomeres are the protective endcaps of chromosomes and their erosion
   with age is thought to play a crucial role in regulating organismal
   senescence and intrinsic lifespan. Following evidence that shorter
   telomeres may reduce the lifespan of animals in a wide range of taxa, we
   predict individuals with shorter telomeres to behave more boldly and
   aggressively. In order to test this, we measured telomere length and
   behaviour in wild juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). We found
   individuals with shorter fin telomeres to behave consistently more
   boldly and aggressively under controlled conditions in the laboratory.
   No such relationship was found with muscle telomere length 3-4 months
   after the behavioural assays. We suggest that telomere dynamics are an
   important factor integrating personality traits with other state
   variables thought to be important in the regulation of behaviour, such
   as metabolism, disease resistance and growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Energy state affects exploratory behavior of tree sparrows in a group
   context under differential food-patch distributions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: When facing a novel situation, animals can retreat or leave
   to avoid risks, but will miss potential resources and opportunities.
   Alternatively they may reduce environmental uncertainty by exploration,
   while risking no energy rewards and exposure to hazards, and use the
   information retrieved for subsequent decision making. When exploring,
   however, animals may adopt different tactics according to individual
   states.
   Results: We tested that energy states will affect exploratory behavior
   by experimenting with wild-caught untrained Eurasian tree sparrows
   (Passer montanus) in fasted or fed states exploring in a novel space
   with hidden food supply in different patch distribution patterns. Our
   data revealed that fasted sparrows risked being earlier explorers more
   often, initiated more exploratory bouts before patches were found, and
   stayed longer on the ground under both patch patterns. Fasted sparrows
   discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in
   dispersed, but not necessary so in clumped, patch patterns; whereas fed
   birds also increased patch finding to a certain level in dispersed
   patterns. Sparrows of both energy states, however, did not differ in
   feeding rates in either patch pattern.
   Conclusions: Exploratory behavior of tree sparrows is state-dependent,
   which supports our prediction that birds with an energy shortage will be
   risk-prone and explore more readily. Our study also indicates a game
   nature of tree sparrow exploratory behavior in a group context when
   explorers are in different energy states and are exposed to different
   patch distributions. Birds of lower energy state adopting an active
   exploring tactic may be favored by obtaining higher energy gains in
   dispersed patch patterns with lower patch richness. More satiated birds,
   however, achieved a similar feeding rate by lowered exposure time.}},

Abstract = {{Internal states can profoundly alter the behavior of animals. A
   quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic

   characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape
   exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult Drosophila

   decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore,
   the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation
   trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while
   satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction
   mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein
   source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to
   mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal
   nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of
   exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ecological and evolutionary model organisms have provided
   extensive insight into the ecological triggers, adaptive benefits, and
   evolution of life-history driven developmental plasticity. Despite this,
   we still have a poor understanding of the underlying genetic changes
   that occur during shifts towards different developmental trajectories.
   The goal of this study is to determine whether we can identify
   underlying gene expression patterns that can describe the different
   life-history trajectories individuals follow in response to social cues
   of competition. To do this, we use the Australian black field cricket
   (Teleogryllus commodus), a species with sex-specific developmental
   trajectories moderated by the density and quality of calls heard during
   immaturity. In this study, we manipulated the social information males
   and females could hear by rearing individuals in either calling or
   silent treatments. We next used RNA-Seq to develop a reference
   transcriptome to study changes in brain gene expression at two points
   prior to sexual maturation.
   Results: We show accelerated development in both sexes when exposed to
   calling; changes were also seen in growth, lifespan, and reproductive
   effort. Functional relationships between genes and phenotypes were
   apparent from ontological enrichment analysis. We demonstrate that
   increased investment towards traits such as growth and reproductive
   effort were often associated with the expression of a greater number of
   genes with similar effect, thus providing a suite of candidate genes for
   future research in this and other invertebrate organisms.
   Conclusions: Our results provide interesting insight into the genomic
   underpinnings of developmental plasticity and highlight the potential of
   a genomic exploration of other evolutionary theories such as condition
   dependence and sex-specific developmental strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The human dopamine D4 receptor (hD(4)R) variants with long tandem
   repeats in the third intracellular loop have been strongly associated
   with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and risk taking
   behaviors. To understand the potential molecular mechanism underlying
   the connection, we have investigated the synaptic function of human D4R
   polymorphism by virally expressing the ADHD-linked 7-repeat allele,
   hD4.7, or its normal counterpart, hD4.4, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   of D4R knockout mice. We found that hD(4)R bound to the SH3 domain of
   PSD-95 in a state-dependent manner. Activation of hD4.7 caused more
   reduction of NR1/PSD-95 binding and NR1 surface expression than hD4.4 in
   PFC slices. Moreover, the NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic
   currents (NMDAR-EPSC) in PFC pyramidal neurons were suppressed to a
   larger extent by hD4.7 than hD4.4 activation. Direct stimulation of
   NMDARs with the partial agonist D-cycloserine prevented the NMDAR
   hypofunction induced by hD4.7 activation. Moreover, hD4.7-expressing
   mice exhibited the increased exploratory and novelty seeking behaviors,
   mimicking the phenotypic hallmark of human ADHD. D-cydoserine
   administration ameliorated the ADHD-like behaviors in hD4.7-expressing
   mice. Our results suggest that over suppression of NMDAR function may
   underlie the role of hD4.7 in ADHD, and enhancing NMDAR signaling may be
   a viable therapeutic strategy to ADHD humans carrying the D4.7 allele.

Abstract = {{Variation in state, which is any factor that alters the value of
   decision options, is likely one of the most common drivers of
   personality differences. However, the general relationship between
   individuals' body state and various personality metrics/average
   behavioral type, repeatability of behavior, and behavioral syndrome
   structure is still poorly resolved. Here, we manipulate body condition
   in three spider species (Agelenopsis aperta, Latrodectus hesperus, and
   Anelosimus studiosus) using contrasting feeding schedules. We then
   assessed the effects of historic feeding regime on individuals' body
   condition, boldness, and foraging aggressiveness. We further assessed
   the effects of feeding regimes on the repeatability of boldness and
   aggressiveness and the presence/absence of correlations between these
   two traits. We found that feeding treatment impacted individuals'
   average boldness and aggressiveness in two species (A. aperta and A.
   studiosus). We also noted that among-individual variance in both
   boldness and aggressiveness was severely reduced when A. aperta and A.
   studiosus were subjected to prolonged food restriction, steeply reducing
   repeatability in these traits. Finally, we noted that correlations
   between boldness and foraging aggressiveness were detectable only in one
   case, revealing no compelling relationship between food restriction and
   the presence/absence of behavioral correlations. Taken together, our
   results suggest that food restriction has only weak, circumstantial
   effects on individuals' average personality type and the correlations
   between behavioral traits. However, there appears to be a robust
   positive relationship between food availability and the signature of
   consistent individual differences in behavior.
   Under laboratory conditions, we found that lower feeding rates sharply
   decreased the repeatability of aggressiveness and boldness in two spider
   species. In doing so, we provide the second body of evidence suggesting
   that a highly prevalent and ecologically relevant state variable, higher
   body condition, can increase the repeatability of foraging-related
   behavioral traits. Additionally, under some feeding regimes, we found
   that hunger levels could alter the average individual aggressiveness and
   boldness but not correlations between these traits. This work highlights
   the importance of state variables such as hunger in eroding behavioral
   repeatability, the defining trait of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report regioselectively functionalized synthesis, as well as
   photo physical, electrochemical, and thermal, of a novel water-soluble
   conjugated polymer. For this purpose, horseradish peroxidase
   (HRP)-catalyzed polymerization of a multifunctional monomer,
   7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid (AHNAPSA) was carried out
   by using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant at room temperature for 24 h
   under air. The structure of poly(7-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalene
   sulfonic acid), (PAHNAPSA) was identified by using nuclear magnetic
   resonance, infrared and ultraviolet-visible. Further characterization
   was performed by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
   thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), photoluminescence (PL), dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and solid state conductivity measurements. The spectral analysis results
   exhibited functional group selective polymerization of the monomer
   containing a multi-active center. Solvent effects on the optical,
   electrochemical and photo physical properties of PAHNAPSA were
   investigated by using five different solvents. PAHNAPSA presented an
   irreversible redox characterization at different scan rates. Optical
   band gap of PAHNAPSA is also found in the range of 3.18 eV to 3.55 eV.
   The fluorescence measurements were utilized to investigate the
   photochemical behaviors of PAHNAPSA in selected polar solvents.
   Accordingly, PAHNAPSA surprisingly presented multicolor emission
   behavior with relatively high quantum yield in all selected solvents. In
   addition, PAHNAPSA presented a reversible pH-responsive behavior and
   also had high selectivity and sensitivity towards chromium ions.
   Finally, the kinetic parameters associated with the solid state thermal
   degradation of PAHNAPSA were calculated from isoconversional methods.
   The TG/DTG analysis showed that PAHNAPSA followed a diffusion controlled
   degradation mechanism in N-2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Depressive disorders cause a substantial burden for the individual and
   the society. Key depressive symptoms can be modeled in animals and
   enable the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Chronic
   unavoidable stress disrupts rats' competence to escape noxious stimuli
   and self-administer sucrose, configuring a depression model
   characterized by escape deficit and motivational anhedonia associated to
   impaired dopaminergic responses to sucrose in the nucleus accumbens
   shell (NAcS). Repeated treatments that restore these responses also
   relieve behavioral symptoms. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine
   neurons encode reward and motivation and are implicated in the
   neuropathology of depressive-like behaviors. Peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors type-alpha (PPAR alpha) acutely
   regulate VTA dopamine neuron firing via beta 2 subunit-containing
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (beta 2{*}nAChRs) through
   phosphorylation and this effect is predictive of antidepressant-like
   effects.
   Here, by combining behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical
   techniques, we studied the effects of repeated PPARa. stimulation by
   fenofibrate on mesolimbic dopamine system. We found decreased beta
   2{*}nAChRs phosphorylation levels and a switch from tonic to phasic
   activity of dopamine cells in the VTA, and increased phosphorylation of
   dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) in the
   NAcS. We then investigated whether long-term fenofibrate administration
   to stressed rats reinstated the decreased DARPP-32 response to sucrose
   and whether this effect translated into antidepressant-like properties.
   Fenofibrate restored dopaminergic responses to appetitive stimuli,
   reactivity to aversive stimuli and motivation to self-administer
   sucrose. Overall, this study suggests PPARa as new targets for
   antidepressant therapies endowed with motivational anti-anhedonic
   properties, further supporting the role of an unbalanced mesolimbic
   dopamine system in pathophysiology of depressive disorders. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, the following hypotheses were explored using zebrafish
   Danio rerio: (1) individuals from the same cohort differ consistently in
   activity and risk-taking and (2) variation in activity and risk-taking
   is linked to individual differences in metabolic rate, body length and
   body condition. To examine these hypotheses, juvenile D. rerio were
   tested for routine metabolic rate and subsequently exposed to an open
   field test. Strong evidence was found for consistent among-individual
   differences in activity and risk-taking, which were overall negatively
   correlated with body length, i.e. larger D. rerio were found to be less
   active in a potentially dangerous open field and a similar trend was
   found with respect to a more direct measure of their risk-taking
   tendency. In contrast, routine metabolic rate and body condition were
   uncorrelated with both activity and risk-taking of juvenile D. rerio.
   These findings suggest that body length is associated with risk-related
   behaviours in juvenile D. rerio for which larger, rather than smaller,
   individuals may have a higher risk of predation, while the role for
   routine metabolic rate is relatively limited or non-existent, at least
   under the conditions of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Many neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by
   deficits in cognitive flexibility. Modeling cognitive flexibility in
   mice enables the investigation of mechanisms underlying these deficits.
   The majority of currently available behavioral tests targeting this
   cognitive domain are reversal learning tasks that require scheduled food
   restriction, extended training periods and labor-intensive, and
   stress-inducing animal handling. Here, we describe a novel 4-day (4-d)
   continuously running task measuring discrimination-and reversal learning
   in an automated home cage (CognitionWall DL/RL task) that largely
   eliminates these limitations. In this task, mice can earn unlimited
   number of food rewards by passing through the correct hole of the
   three-holed CognitionWall. To assess the validity and sensitivity of
   this novel task, the performance of C57BL/6J mice, amyloid precursor
   protein/presenilin1 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice, a-calmodulin kinase-II
   (aCaMKII) T305D knock-in mice, and mice with an orbitofrontal cortex
   lesion were examined. We found that C57BL/6J mice reach stable
   performance levels within the 4 d of the task, while experiencing only
   slight reductions in weight and no major effects on circadian rhythm.
   The task detected learning deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic and aCaMKII
   T305D mutant mice. Additionally, we established that the orbitofrontal
   cortex underlies reversal learning performance in our task. Because of
   its short duration and the absence of food deprivation and concurrent
   weight loss, this novel automated home-cage task substantially improves
   comprehensive preclinical assessment of cognitive functions in mouse
   models of psychiatric and neurological disorders and also enables
   analysis during specific developmental stages.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Socio-economic status (SES) is a strong determinant of
   eating behavior and the obesity risk.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine which eating and lifestyle behaviors mediate the
   association between SES and obesity.
   METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 318 obese people and 371
   non-obese people in northern France. Ten eating behavior traits were
   assessed using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 21-Item and
   an eating attitude questionnaire (on plate size, the number of servings,
   reasons for stopping eating and the frequency of eating standing up,
   eating in front of the television set (TV) and eating at night). The SES
   score (in three categories) was based on occupation, education and
   income categories. Mediation analysis was performed using the test of
   joint significance and the difference of coefficients test.
   RESULTS: The age-and gender-adjusted obesity risk was higher for
   individuals in the low-SES groups (odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence
   interval (CI) = 1.82 (1.48-2.24), P<0.0001). Additional servings were
   associated with a higher obesity risk (OR = 3.43, P<0.0001). Cognitive
   restraint (P<0.0001) and emotional eating (P<0.0001) scores were higher
   in obese participants than in non-obese participants but did not depend
   on SES. Of the 10 potential factors tested, eating off a large plate (P
   = 0.01), eating at night (P = 0.04) and uncontrolled eating (P = 0.03)
   significantly mediated the relationship between SES and obesity.
   CONCLUSION: Our results highlighted a number of obesogenic behaviors
   among socially disadvantaged participants: large plate size,
   uncontrolled eating and eating at night were significant mediators of
   the relationship between SES and the obesity risk.}},

Abstract = {{Mate preference was long assumed to be static and open-ended. However, a
   growing body of evidence actually suggests that the predominant factor
   in mate choice fluctuates due to the context dependence of the factors
   involved in sexual selection. In particular, fluctuation in the local
   environment, the density of individuals, and the presence of
   heterospecifics can all alter the strength, form, or direction of sexual
   selection by shaping the fitness costs and benefits of the traits that
   mediate male-female interactions. Amphibians constitute useful
   biological models to examine context dependence in sexual selection as
   the availability of suitable breeding resources may significantly impact
   the cost-benefit trade-off between mating strategies. Using an
   experimental approach, we examined how the risk of larval competition in
   breeding ponds affects pond occupancy, male-male spacing behavior, and
   spawning decisions in an anuran, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina
   variegata). Then, we examined how female mate choice is affected by male
   body condition and how the risk of larval competition might influence
   females when choosing a mate. Our results indicate that male pond
   preference is strongly affected by the presence of conspecific tadpoles.
   Males preferentially selected ponds free of tadpoles, and spawning
   mainly occurred in these same ponds. This preference influenced male
   spacing behavior by enhancing the proximity of competing males when the
   availability of good-quality sites was experimentally manipulated, which
   had further significant consequences on females' choice of mate. The
   article also discusses the evolutionary causes and consequences of such
   context-dependent mate choice in amphibians and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization constitutes one of the most profound forms of land-use
   change and strongly affects global biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. Expansion of urban areas typically leads to species loss
   but may also induce more subtle changes in species dynamics through
   selection or plasticity. Using a dual correlative (field) and
   experimental (aviary) approach, we here show that free-ranging urban
   house sparrows in southern France were smaller and lighter than their
   rural counterparts after allometric scaling, whereas 2 independent
   indices of nutritional (feather growth rates) and developmental (feather
   asymmetry) stress did not vary with urbanization. When subjecting these
   individuals to urban or rural diets in a highly predictable, controlled
   setting, rural but not urban sparrows decreased their body mass,
   independent of diet type, to the extent that initial scaled mass
   differences between urban and rural birds disappeared by the end of the
   captive period. By integrating field-and aviary measurements of body
   size and mass with indices of nutritional and developmental stress, we
   conclude that the lower scaled body masses of urban birds likely reflect
   a plastic response to predictable food supplies, possibly mediated
   through predation. Urban environments therefore do not necessarily
   constitute nutritionally stressful environments for species that
   typically cohabit with humans, such as house sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Personality is an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it
   constrains behavioral flexibility. One theory suggests that personality
   could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It
   is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival
   probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among
   individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social
   niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals
   that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social
   conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the
   social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for
   development after a change in social status. In the facultative
   cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis),
   residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this
   forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to
   test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual
   differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an
   individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young
   individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age
   reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers,
   suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's
   social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will
   be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social
   state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social
   state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However,
   novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive
   state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism
   for generating individual differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Traits that facilitate competition for reproductive resources or that
   influence mate choice generally have a heightened sensitivity to
   stressors. They have evolved to signal resilience to infectious disease
   and nutritional and social stressors, and they are compromised by
   exposure to man-made toxins. Although these traits can differ from one
   species or sex to the next, an understanding of the dynamics of
   competition and choice can in theory be used to generate a priori
   predictions about sex-, age-, and trait-specific vulnerabilities for any
   sexually reproducing species. I provide a review of these dynamics and
   illustrate associated vulnerabilities in nonhuman species. The age- and
   sex-specific vulnerability of such traits is then illustrated for
   stressor-related disruptions of boys' and girls' physical growth and
   play behavior, as well as for aspects of boys' and girls' and men's and
   women's personality, language, and spatial abilities. There is much that

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing competitive ability of individuals can create a
   Tragedy of the Commons ending in extinction. Theory has not yet
   evaluated what role adaptive habitat selection might play in the tragedy
   and its outcome.
   Methods: We used modified Ricker population models to simulate the
   long-term population dynamics emerging from a pure strategy of despotic
   habitat choice versus a mixed strategy of despotic and ideal-free
   habitat selection. Density in the better of two habitats was reduced by
   the threat of dominance in the pure strategy. Habitat selection switched
   to an ideal-free distribution at low densities in the mixed strategy. We
   used patterns of density and dispersal, giving-up densities,
   personalities and condition of meadow voles to search for the predicted
   switch in habitat selection.
   Results: Extinction probabilities in simulated stochastic environments
   were always higher for pure than for mixed strategies. Experiments on
   meadow voles were only partially consistent with a density-dependent
   transition from ideal-free to despotic habitat selection. Densities and
   giving-up densities of voles in adjacent habitats were nearly identical
   when resources were equal and population size was small. Giving-up
   densities diverged dramatically when supplemental food was added to one
   habitat and not to the other. Despite biased dispersal from high-to
   low-quality habitat, there was no associated difference in population
   density, personality or body condition.
   Conclusions: Pure habitat selection based on dominance places
   populations at greater risk of extinction than does a mixed strategy in
   which dominance disappears at low population sizes. Experiments on
   meadow voles yielded limited but nevertheless tantalizing support for
   such a density-dependent switch in habitat selection.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Nutrition behaviors of adolescent girls is of serious health concerns.
   Although nutrition education interventions in Iran have met with some
   success, most of them could not promote nutrition behavioral changes.
   The aim of our study is to determine a school-based nutrition education
   intervention to improve adolescents' nutrition behaviors and behavioral
   mediators based on the social cognitive theory (SCT).
   Materials and Methods
   This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Eligible
   participants will be all student girls in grade 6 and 7, their parents
   and teachers in Isfahan governmental schools. This multi component
   school-based intervention include adolescents' nutrition education
   package, parents' nutrition massages, participatory homework, parents
   and teachers nutrition education package, supportive group, and
   collaboration with decision makers. Changing in nutrition behaviors
   including breakfast, fruit and vegetable, snack and fast food
   consumption will be examined, as primary outcome. Secondary outcome will
   be behavioral mediators such as knowledge, self-efficacy, intention,
   situation, self-regulation, social support, outcome expectations and
   expectancies, in adolescent girls. The outcomes will be assessed at
   baseline, and after 3 and 6-month follow-up.
   Discussion
   This study evaluates a school-based, guided SCT intervention, designed
   to improve healthy dietary behaviors, nutrition knowledge of adolescent
   girls. Few behavioral interventions have targeted this high-risk
   population in Iran. The intervention seems to be promising and has the
   potential to bridge the gap of the limited program outcomes of nutrition
   education in Iranian adolescents.}},

Title = {{A personality trait contributes to the occurrence of postoperative
   delirium: a prospective study}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although various physical risk factors for delirium have
   been identified, the effect of psychological aspects is currently
   unknown. This study aimed to examine psychological risk factors for
   postoperative delirium and to identify hidden subgroups of delirium in
   clinical and psychological feature space.
   Methods: Among 200 patients with hip fracture, 78 elderly patients were
   prospectively evaluated for clinical and psychological assessments
   before surgery. As delirium was assessed from the next day to the 7th
   day after surgery, postoperative delirium was found in 40 patients, but
   not in 38 patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
   analyses were used to explore risk factors for postoperative delirium.
   Phenotypic subgroups of delirium were assessed using Topological Data
   Analysis, in which the significant risk factors were used for evaluating
   filter and distance metrics.
   Results: Mini-Mental State Examination, neuroticism, conscientiousness,
   and regional anesthesia were identified as a predictive risk factor for
   postoperative delirium. The filter metric showed significant negative
   correlations with nutrition-related factors such as total protein and
   albumin. When filter metric and Euclidean distances were entered,
   delirious patients were bifurcated as a function of personality traits
   and anesthesia method in the patient-patient network.
   Conclusions: A personality trait of neuroticism and conscientiousness
   may predispose elderly patients to postoperative delirium and this
   influence may be amplified by regional anesthesia. This study verifies
   the contribution of psychological risk factors to delirium and provides
   new insight for complex etiologies of delirium by mapping various
   clinical variables in the topological space.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{According to dual-system theory, instrumental learning and performance
   depend on the balance between goal-directed and habitual action control.
   Overreliance on habits has been argued to characterize clinical
   conditions such as drug addiction or obsessive-compulsive disorder as
   well as obesity and excessive impulsivity. A tendency toward habitual
   action control in obesity has already been indicated in the food domain.
   However, impairments might not be restricted to eating behavior. This
   has been suggested by domain-general obesity-associated disturbances in
   executive function as well as alterations in corticostriatal circuits
   underlying the goal-directed and habitual systems. In this study we
   examined the balance of goal-directed and habitual action control in a
   sample of normal-weight, overweight, and obese participants (n = 105)
   using the slips-of-action test in a non-food context. We tested for
   continuous or group-based associations between body weight status (BMI)
   and the devaluation sensitivity index (DSI), a parameter representing
   the balance of the goal-directed and habitual systems in action control.
   As personality differences in the domain of impulsivity might affect
   this relationship, we also examined whether the interaction between BMI
   and self-reported impulsivity, based on the UPPS Impulsive Behavior
   Scale, was related to the DSI. In addition to that, we tested for
   direct, i.e., weight status independent, relationships between UPPS
   subdomains of impulsivity and the DSI. We failed to find evidence for a
   relationship between weight status and sensitivity to devaluation as
   indexed by the DSI. However, independent of weight status, we observed
   lower sensitivity to devaluation in sensation seekers, a subtype of
   impulsivity. To conclude, behavioral flexibility in the sense of
   disturbances in the balance between the habitual and goal-directed
   systems seems to be unaffected by weight status in a non-food context.
   Consequently, stimuli and behavior might not be generally excessively
   linked in overweight or obesity. However, according to ceiling effects
   we cannot rule out subtle effects the paradigm was not able to
   disentangle. Further, future studies are needed to clarify the role of
   specific subtypes of obesity (e.g., food addiction). The indicated habit
   propensity in sensation seekers may account for previous reports of weak
   avoidance behavior and risky decision making.}},

Title = {{Contexts Paired with Junk Food Impair Goal-Directed Behavior in Rats:
   Implications for Decision Making in Obesogenic Environments}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The high prevalence of obesity and related metabolic diseases calls for
   greater understanding of the factors that drive excess energy intake.
   Calorie-dense palatable foods are readily available and often are paired
   with highly salient environmental cues. These cues can trigger
   food-seeking and consumption in the absence of hunger. Here we examined
   the effects of palatable food-paired environmental cues on control of
   instrumental food-seeking behavior. In Experiment 1, adult male rats
   received exposures to one context containing three ``junk{''} foods (JFs
   context) and another containing chow (Chow context). Next, rats were
   food-deprived and trained to perform instrumental responses
   (lever-press) for two novel food rewards in a third, distinct context.
   Contextual influences on flexible control of food-seeking behavior were
   then assessed by outcome devaluation tests held in the JF, chow and
   training contexts. Devaluation was achieved using specific satiety and
   test order was counterbalanced. Rats exhibited goal-directed control
   over behavior when tested in the training and chow-paired contexts.
   Notably, performance was habitual (insensitive to devaluation) when
   tested in the JF context. In Experiment 2 we tested whether the
   impairment found in the JF context could be ameliorated by the
   presentation of a discrete auditory cue paired with the chow context,
   relative to a second cue paired with the JF context. Consistent with the
   results of Experiment 1, the devaluation effect was not significant when
   rats were tested in the JF context with the JF cue. However, presenting
   the chow cue increased the impact of the devaluation treatment leading
   to a robust devaluation effect. Further tests confirmed that performance
   in the chow context was goal-directed and that sensory-specific satiety
   in the JF context was intact. These results show that environments
   paired with palatable foods can impair goal-directed control over
   food-seeking behavior, but that this deficit was improved by a cue
   paired with chow. This has promising implications for assisting
   individuals in controlling their eating behavior in environments
   designed to dysregulate it.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Developmental origins of cardiometabolic diseases have been related to
   maternal nutritional conditions. In this context, the rising incidence
   of arterial hypertension, diabetes type II, and dyslipidemia has been
   attributed to genetic programming. Besides, environmental conditions
   during perinatal development such as maternal undernutrition or
   overnutrition can program changes in the integration among physiological
   systems leading to cardiometabolic diseases. This phenomenon can be
   understood in the context of the phenotypic plasticity and refers to the
   adjustment of a phenotype in response to environmental input without
   genetic change, following a novel, or unusual input during development.
   Experimental studies indicate that fetal exposure to an adverse maternal
   environment may alter the morphology and physiology that contribute to
   the development of cardiometabolic diseases. It has been shown that both
   maternal protein restriction and overnutrition alter the central and
   peripheral control of arterial pressure and metabolism. This review will
   address the new concepts on the maternal diet induced-cardiometabolic
   diseases that include the potential role of the perinatal malnutrition.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Scatter-hoarding rodents can act as both predators and dispersers for
   many large-seeded plants because they cache seeds for future use, but
   occasionally forget them in sites with high survival and establishment
   probabilities. The most important fruit or seed trait influencing rodent
   foraging behavior is seed size; rodents prefer large seeds because they
   have higher nutritional content, but this preference can be
   counterbalanced by the higher costs of handling larger seeds. We
   designed a cafeteria experiment to assess whether fruit and seed size of
   Myrcianthes coquimbensis, an endangered desert shrub, influence the
   decision-making process during foraging by three species of
   scatter-hoarding rodents differing in body size: Abrothrix olivaceus,
   Phyllotis darwini and Octodon degus. We found that the size of fruits
   and seeds influenced foraging behavior in the three rodent species; the
   probability of a fruit being harvested and hoarded was higher for larger
   fruits than for smaller ones. Patterns of fruit size preference were not
   affected by rodent size; all species were able to hoard fruits within
   the entire range of sizes offered. Finally, fruit and seed size had no
   effect on the probability of seed predation, rodents typically ate only
   the fleshy pulp of the fruits offered and discarded whole, intact seeds.
   In conclusion, our results reveal that larger M. coquimbensis fruits
   have higher probabilities of being harvested, and ultimately of its
   seeds being hoarded and dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents. As this
   plant has no other dispersers, rodents play an important role in its
   recruitment dynamics.}},

Title = {{Differences in Knowledge, Stress, Sensation Seeking, and Locus of
   Control Linked to Dietary Adherence in Hemodialysis Patients}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often require regular
   hemodialysis (HD) to prolong life. However, between HD sessions,
   patients have to restrict their diets carefully to avoid excess
   accumulation of potassium, phosphate, sodium, and fluid, which their
   diseased kidneys can no longer regulate. Failure to adhere to their
   renal dietary regimes can be fatal; nevertheless, non-adherence is
   common, and yet little is known about the psychological variables that
   might predict this dietary behavior. Thus, this study aimed to assess
   whether dietary adherence might be affected by a variety of
   psychological factors including stress, personality, and health locus of
   control, as well as dietary knowledge, in chronic HD patients. Fifty-one
   patients (30 men; age range 25-85) who had undergone HD for at least 3
   months and had been asked to restrict at least one of potassium,
   phosphate or fluid, were recruited from a hospital renal unit. Measures
   of adherence to each of potassium, phosphate, and fluid were derived
   from standard criteria for these physiological indices in renal
   patients. Knowledge of food/drink sources of these dietary factors, and
   their medical implications in relation to HD and CKD were assessed by a
   bespoke questionnaire. Psychological factors including stress,
   personality and health locus of control beliefs were measured by
   standardized questionnaires. Having to restrict a particular nutrient
   was associated with better knowledge of both food sources and medical
   complications for that nutrient; however, greater dietary knowledge was
   not linked to adherence, and knowledge of medical complications tended
   to be associated with poorer adherence to potassium and phosphate
   levels. Adherence to these two nutrient requirements was also associated
   with lower reported stress in the past week. Adherence was associated
   with differences in locus of control: these differences varied across
   indices although there was a tendency to believe in external loci. For
   potassium, phosphate, and fluid restriction, adherers were less likely
   to be sensation seekers but did not differ from non-adherers on
   impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, or hopelessness. In conclusion, the
   links between dietary adherence and stress, locus of control and
   personality suggests that screening for such psychological factors may
   assist in managing adherence in HD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Animals generally adjust their behavior in response to bodily state
   (e.g., size and energy reserves) to optimize energy intake in relation
   to mortality risk, weighing predation probability against the risk of
   starvation. Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta
   adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size
   during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is
   important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days,
   respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different
   combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL;
   first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively).
   Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the
   treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \%
   more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large
   within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for
   this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more
   actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration.
   Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being
   more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were
   positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied
   population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish
   two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive
   individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive
   individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct
   behavioral strategies early in life.
   This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in
   animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data
   suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is
   increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a
   limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On
   the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression,
   likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance.
   The experiment was carried out during the main population survival
   bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during
   this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited,
   and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our
   data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters,
   based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are
   positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and
   aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral
   strategy.}},

   response comes about is notoriously difficult. One promising avenue is
   to manipulate a single defensive trait and observe how that modifies
   fitness as well as the expression of other inducible responses. In
   chemically-defended animals, toxins are likely to be costly to produce
   but it is still unknown how their depletion influences other
   characteristics. In the present study, we artificially depleted
   bufadienolide toxin stores in common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles, and
   assessed the effect of this with respect to the interaction with
   predator presence and limited food availability. We found that toxin
   depletion in tadpoles did not significantly affect any of the measured
   life-history traits. Tadpoles in the predator treatment exhibited an
   elevated development rate, although this was only apparent when food
   availability was limited. Also, body mass at metamorphosis was lower in
   tadpoles exposed to chemical cues indicating a predation threat and when
   food availability was limited. These results provide evidence that, in
   larval common toads, the expression of inducible defences may incur
   fitness costs, whereas chemical defences are either expressed
   constitutively or, if inducible, elevated toxin production has
   negligible costs.}},

Abstract = {{Chill susceptible insects like Drosophila lose the ability to regulate
   water and ion homeostasis at low temperatures. This loss of hemolymph
   ion and water balance drives a hyperkalemic state that depolarizes
   cells, causing cellular injury and death. The ability to maintain ion
   homeostasis at low temperatures and/or recover ion homeostasis upon
   rewarming is closely related to insect cold tolerance. We thus
   hypothesized that changes to organismal ion balance, which can be
   achieved in Drosophila through dietary salt loading, could alter whole
   animal cold tolerance phenotypes. We put Drosophila melanogaster in the
   presence of diets highly enriched in NaCI, ICCI, xylitol (an osmotic
   control) or sucrose (a dietary supplement known to impact cold
   tolerance) for 24 h and confirmed that they consumed the novel food.
   Independently of their osmotic effects, NaCI, KCl, and sucrose
   supplementation all improved the ability of flies to maintain K+ balance
   in the cold, which allowed for faster recovery from chill coma after 6 h
   at 0 degrees C. These supplements, however, also slightly increased the
   CTmin and had little impact on survival rates following chronic cold
   stress (24 h at 0 degrees C), suggesting that the effect of diet on cold
   tolerance depends on the measure of cold tolerance assessed. In contrast
   to prolonged salt stress, brief feeding (1.5 h) on diets high in salt
   slowed coma recovery, suggesting that the long-term effects of NaCI and
   KC1 on chilling tolerance result from phenotypic plasticity, induced in
   response to a salty diet, rather than simply the presence of the diet in
   the gut lumen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Female college students are prone to unhealthy eating patterns that can
   impact long-term health. This study examined female students' healthy
   and unhealthy eating behaviors with three decision-making models.
   Specifically, the theory of reasoned action, prototype/willingness

   reasoned (logical) and reactive (impulsive) factors relate to dietary
   decisions. Females (N= 583, M-age = 20.89 years) completed measures on
   reasoned cognitions about foods (attitudes, subjective norms, nutrition
   knowledge, intentions to eat foods), reactive cognitions about foods
   (prototypes, affect, willingness to eat foods), dieting, and food
   consumption. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed the new
   reasoned/reactive model to be the preeminent model for examining eating
   behaviors. This model showed that attitudes were related to intentions
   and willingness to eat healthy and unhealthy foods. Affect was related
   to willingness to eat healthy and unhealthy foods, whereas nutrition
   knowledge was related to intentions and willingness to eat healthy foods
   only. Intentions and willingness were related to healthy and unhealthy

Abstract = {{Individuals can respond to predation risk by building morphological

   Physa acuta (Draparnaud, 1805) snails with better morphological defenses
   against predation risk displayed lower or higher behavioral responses to

   the morphological traits of snails influence their risk of predation by
   crayfish, inferred by crush resistance, and how those same traits also
   influence their patch use in the absence and presence of predator cues.
   Using model selection, we found that a large shell width increased crush
   resistance. We also found that other morphological traits interacted
   with predator cues to influence the use of high resource patches,
   however shell width had almost no influence. Aperture length and
   aperture width both strongly interacted with cue: larger aperture length
   and larger aperture width snails decreased their use of the high
   resource patch substantially. Additionally we used a composite model to
   test whether estimated crush resistance, predator cue, or their
   interaction best predicted space use, and found no support that our
   estimate for crush resistance affected space use. Generally we found
   strong support that morphology effects crush resistance and also that

Title = {{Applying neurobiology to the treatment of adults with anorexia nervosa}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anorexia nervosa is a severe, biologically based brain
   disorder with significant medical complications. It is critical that
   new, effective treatments are developed to interrupt the persistent
   course of the illness due to the medical and psychological sequelae.
   Several psychosocial, behavioral and pharmacologic interventions have
   been investigated in adult anorexia nervosa; however, evidence shows
   that their impact is weak and treatment effects are generally small.
   Method: This paper describes a new neurobiological anorexia nervosa
   model that shifts focus from solely external influences, such as social
   and family, to include internal influences that integrate genetic and
   neurobiological contributions, across the age span. The model serves as
   a theoretical structure for a new, five-day treatment, outlined in this
   paper, targeting anorexia nervosa temperament, which integrates
   neurobiological dimensions into evidence-based treatment interventions.
   The treatment is in two phases. Phase I is a five day, 40 hour treatment
   for anorexia nervosa adults. Phase II is the follow-up and is currently
   being developed.
   Results: Preliminary qualitative acceptability data on 37 adults with
   anorexia nervosa and 60 supports (e.g., spouses, parents, aunts,
   friends, partners, children of anorexia nervosa adults) are promising
   from Phase I. Clients with anorexia nervosa and their supports report
   that learning neurobiological facts improved their understanding of the
   illness and helped equip them with better tools to manage anorexia
   nervosa traits and symptoms. In addition, nutritional knowledge changed
   significantly.
   Conclusions: This is the first neurobiologically based, five-day
   treatment for adults with anorexia nervosa and their supports. It is a
   new model that outlines underlying genetic and neurobiological
   contributions to anorexia nervosa that serves as a foundation to treat
   both traits and symptoms. Preliminary qualitative findings are
   promising, with both clients and supports reporting that the
   neurobiological treatment approach helped them better understand the
   illness, while better conceptualizing how to respond to their traits and
   manage their symptoms. Data in Phase I shows promise as a
   neurobiologically based intervention for anorexia nervosa, and it serves
   as a foundation for the development of Phase II. Evidence of ongoing
   program efficacy will be described as data are reported on Phase II.}},

   tested exogenous ketone supplements added to food and fed chronically
   for 83 days in SPD rats and administered sub-chronically for 7 days in
   both rat models by daily intragastric gavage bolus followed by
   assessment of anxiety measures on elevated plus maze (EPM). The groups
   included standard diet (SD) or SD + ketone supplementation. Low-dose
   ketone ester (LKE: 1,3butanediol-acetoacetate diester, similar to 10
   g/kg/day, LKE), high dose ketone ester (HKE; 25 g/kg/day, HKE),
   beta-hydroxybutyrate-mineral salt (beta HB-S; 25 g/kg/day, KS) and beta
   HB-S + medium chain triglyceride (MCI similar to 25 g/kg/day, KSMCT)
   were used as ketone supplementation for chronic administration. To
   extend our results, exogenous ketone supplements were also tested
   sub-chronically on SPD rats (KE, KS and KSMCT; 5 g/kg/day) and on
   WAG/Rij rats (KE, KS and KSMCT; 2.5 g/kg/day). At the end of treatments
   behavioral data collection was conducted manually by a blinded observer
   and with a video-tracking system, after which blood beta HB and glucose
   levels were measured. Ketone supplementation reduced anxiety on EPM as
   measured by less entries to closed arms (sub-chronic KE and KS: SPD rats
   and KSMCT: WAG/Rij rats), more time spent in open arms (sub-chronic KE:
   SPD and KSMCT: WAG/Rij rats; chronic KSMCT: SPD rats), more distance
   traveled in open arms (chronic KS and KSMCT: SPD rats) and by delayed
   latency to entrance to closed arms (chronic KSMCT: SPD rats), when
   compared to control. Our data indicates that chronic and sub-chronic
   ketone supplementation not only elevated blood beta HB levels in both
   animal models, but reduced anxiety-related behavior. We conclude that
   ketone supplementation may represent a promising anxiolytic strategy
   through a novel means of inducing nutritional ketosis.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral plasticity is a key feature allowing animals to broaden their
   dietary niche when novel food resources become available, and
   long-fingered bats provide an appropriate model system to study the
   underpinnings of behavioral plasticity, since although generally being
   an insectivorous species, some individuals have been reported to catch
   fish. Aiming to get insight into the origin of fishing behavior in
   long-fingered bats, we studied in the field the differences in sensorial
   and mechanical reactions to insect-like (stationary) and fish-like
   (temporary) prey stimuli between well-known piscivorous and strictly
   insectivorous individuals. Both piscivorous and insectivorous
   individuals exhibited a qualitatively similar reaction to temporary
   target stimuli (longer and deeper dips and terminal echolocation phase
   skewed towards buzz I compared to stationary stimuli). Nevertheless, the
   quantitative differences observed in the sensorial and mechanical
   features (the intensity of the shift was significantly greater in
   piscivorous than in insectivorous individuals) show that piscivorous
   individuals have honed their capture technique likely enhancing the
   fishing success. Thus, our results suggest that the fishing technique
   was developed from a primary reaction shared by all long-fingered bats.
   All individuals seem to be mechanically and sensorially adapted to
   detect and capture fish, although under appropriate environmental
   conditions, they would further improve their technique by experience

Abstract = {{Movement of organisms is an important activity that has ecological and

   dispersal and measured relative to home ranges. This simplistic approach
   belies the complexity of the process. Movement of freshwater stream fish
   has been at times viewed as predominantly restricted in nature, but
   recent research challenges this paradigm since some distribution of
   movement exists in every population. A better research approach is to
   understand the drivers that promote or limit movement. Drivers of
   movement can be categorized as extrinsic ecological factors (context
   dependent), e.g., habitat quality, habitat variability, and the presence
   of predators, and intrinsic traits of the fish (condition dependent),
   such as body size and condition. One intrinsic trait that has received
   relatively little attention is the inherent personality to be sedentary
   or mobile, and how this interacts with the suite of traits and behaviors
   to drive movement. Future movement behavior research should focus on the
   interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers to better understand the
   evolutionary and ecological implications of movement.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Solid epidemiological evidence indicates that part of the risk of
   obesity in adulthood could be programmed during prenatal development by
   the quality of maternal nutrition. Nevertheless, the molecular
   mechanisms involved are mostly unknown, which hinders our capacity to
   develop effective intervention policies. Here, we discuss the hypothesis
   that mechanisms underlying prenatal programming of adult risk are
   epigenetic and sensitive to environmental cues such as nutrition. While
   the information encoded in DNA is essentially stable, regulatory
   epigenetic mechanisms include reversible, covalent modifications of DNA
   and chromatin, such as methylation, acetylation etc. It is known that
   dietary availability of methyl donors has an impact on the patterns of
   gene expression by affecting DNA methylation at regulatory regions, a
   likely basis for reprogramming developmental plasticity. The Agouti and
   Axin-Psed genes, as well as the embryonic growth factor IGF2/H19 locus
   are examples of diet-induced modulation of phenotypic traits by
   affecting methylation of gene-regulatory regions. Recent work has
   evidenced an unsuspected role for chromatin as metabolic sensor.
   Chromatin is susceptible to a number of post-translational modifications
   that modulate gene expression, among them the GIcNAcylation of histone
   proteins and other epigenetic regulators. Intracellular levels of the
   precursor molecule UDP-GIcNAc, and hence the degree of global chromatin
   GIcNAcylation, depend on the energetic state of the cell, making
   GIcNAcylation a functional link between nutrition and regulation of gene
   expression. Dietary interference with these regulatory mechanisms could
   effectively counteract the early-life programming of adult risk. (C)

   vigilant in response to the predator olfactory cue; however, roe deer
   vigilance did not differ measurably among areas with or without
   potential lynx presence. Deer were more vigilant before sunset than
   during the night at both study areas, probably due to long-term
   adaptation of roe deer to human hunting during daytime. Vigilance
   decreased from August to September even though activity of lynx
   increases in autumn, which may be a result either of increased foraging
   due to decrease in food quality in autumn, or of changes in social
   organization of the deer. Our results suggested that the degree of
   vigilance depends on environmental cues. We found that roe deer respond
   to lynx urine despite a long absence of lynx in the ecosystem. Our
   results support the risk allocation hypothesis for responses to pulses
   of high risk but not for responses to continuous elevated levels of
   risk.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{1-9}},

Abstract = {{Paternal care is less common than maternal care because male fitness
   usually depends on the number of mating opportunities with distinct
   females. Yet, males also invest in parental care when offspring survival
   depends on paternal contribution for protection and/or brood nutrition
   and mating opportunities with new females are scarce. Although the
   second condition is common in spiders, male contribution to the survival
   of spiderlings is very rare. However, males of Manogea porracea build
   their webs above female webs, where they capture prey throughout the
   reproductive period. In addition, both sexes may have contact with
   eggsacs and attack predators that approach them. This unusual extended
   period of co-occurrence between males and their offspring may favour the
   establishment of paternal care. Here, we investigated (1) the mortality
   factors influencing offspring survival, (2) how the presence of parents
   affects offspring survival, (3) how males affect web integrity and
   protect eggs against predation and (4) variations in operational sex
   ratio (OSR) during the reproductive season, along with the proportion of
   eggsacs in webs occupied by males alone before the dispersal of
   spiderlings. We found that (1) four kleptoparasitic/araneophagic spider
   species invaded webs and attacked eggsacs, (2) parental care
   significantly improved offspring survival, (3) males maintained web
   integrity and protected offspring against the attacks of two
   araneophagic species and (4) the OSR became quickly biased towards
   males, and that these remaining males assumed exclusive care of 68\% of
   the eggsacs produced during the season. The ability of males to protect
   the offspring and the reduced availability of receptive females at the
   end of the reproductive season might represent the possible causes of
   male care in M. porracea. We propose that web building by males and
   their rapid access to the eggsacs create unique conditions that may
   favour the evolution of paternal care in Cyrtophorinae. (C) 2016 The

   experiment}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed recently that labile state variables (e.g. energy
   reserves) can have a key role in the development and maintenance of
   consistent between-individual behavioural variation (i.e. animal
   personality) within population. In male Carpetan rock lizards
   (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D-3 component of femoral gland
   secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further,
   vitamin D-3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles.
   Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low)
   and vitamin D-3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught
   reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile
   components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the
   degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean
   behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all
   treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food x
   vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present
   in all but the low food x placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i)
   decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter
   use in the vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased
   risk taking in the low food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment. We
   conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both
   behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I.
   cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural
   consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general.
   Individuals with high specific (vitamin D-3) but low general (energy
   reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary
   explanations for the reported patterns.
   Significance statement
   The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent
   between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations
   (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been
   recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed
   the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual
   differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether
   short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults
   is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the
   amount of food and vitamin D-3 (known to increase physiological quality
   and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected
   the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of
   reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards. Therefore, we provide evidence
   that short-term environmental variation does induce or suppress animal
   personality, and it also affects individual behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species must respond appropriately to novel habitats as they
   expand their ranges. The degree of habitat novelty is likely to be the
   highest immediately following human-mediated range-expansion, which can
   move an individual very large distances beyond its home range within a
   short space of time. How does translocation affect those critically
   important initial colonists? We collected cane toads (Rhinella marina)
   in eastern Australia in heath and woodland habitats, simulated either
   short-distance or long-distance transport (level of transport stress)
   and then either returned toads to their exact collection point or
   reciprocally translocated them to a novel site. Following release, we
   radio-tracked toads for 5 days and recorded their shelter types and
   microhabitat use daily. We also examined the thermal and hydric
   conditions experienced by toads and tested if prey intake, stomach mass
   and body condition of translocated toads differed from those of resident
   conspecifics. Translocated toads used different types of diurnal
   shelters, were more exposed by day and experienced higher diurnal
   temperatures (but not more desiccating conditions). Analysis of stomach
   contents indicated that translocation per se did not reduce feeding
   rates, nor reduce body condition. However, toads exposed to higher
   transport stress (simulating long-distance displacement) exhibited
   changes to body condition and hydric balance. Shifts in toad shelter
   site use induced by translocation may increase the toads' visibility to
   diurnal predators, thereby reducing toad survival but also exacerbating
   the ecological impact of toads during the initial phase of
   post-translocation dispersal.
   Significance statement
   Each stage of the invasion process poses unique challenges for invading
   taxa, and very few species possess the full suite of behavioural,
   physiological or morphological traits required to pass through all
   stages of the invasion pathway. Although the study of invasion biology
   has grown exponentially, most research has focused on the determinants
   of invasion success during the later stages of establishment and spread,
   neglecting the earlier stages of transport and introduction.
   Understanding how species respond to all stages of the invasion process
   can clarify the non-random traits that allow certain species to become
   successful invaders.}},

Abstract = {{Natal dispersal outcomes are an interplay between environmental
   conditions and individual phenotypes. Peripheral, isolated populations
   may experience altered environmental conditions and natal dispersal
   patterns that differ from populations in contiguous landscapes. We
   document nonphilopatric, sex-biased natal dispersal in an endangered
   small mammal, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus
   grahamensis), restricted to a single mountain. Other North American red
   squirrel populations are shown to have sex-unbiased, philopatric natal
   dispersal. We ask what environmental and intrinsic factors may be
   driving this atypical natal dispersal pattern. We test for the influence
   of proximate factors and ultimate drivers of natal dispersal: habitat
   fragmentation, local population density, individual behavior traits,
   inbreeding avoidance, competition for mates, and competition for
   resources, allowing us to better understand altered natal dispersal
   patterns at the periphery of a species' range. A juvenile squirrel's
   body condition and its mother's mass in spring (a reflection of her
   intrinsic quality and territory quality) contribute to individual
   behavioral tendencies for movement and exploration. Resources, behavior,
   and body condition have the strongest influence on natal dispersal
   distance, but affect males and females differently. Male natal dispersal
   distance is positively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and
   individual tendency for movement; female natal dispersal distance is
   negatively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and positively
   influenced by individual tendency for movement. An apparent feedback
   between environmental variables and subsequent juvenile behavioral state
   contributes to an altered natal dispersal pattern in a peripheral

Abstract = {{Personality exists in non-human animals and can impact fitness. There
   is, however, a shortage of empirical studies in certain areas within the
   field, and fundamental evolutionary theory on personality remains
   largely untested. For example, little is known on how variation in
   personality is maintained over evolutionary time. Theory suggests that
   fluctuating selection pressures due to spatiotemporal variation in
   conditions, e.g. food availability, is a possible mechanism and a few
   studies have shown that the success of different personality types
   varies with spatiotemporal conditions. However, it remains unknown
   whether different mechanisms can maintain personality within a species.
   Here we use a reintroduction programme for the critically endangered
   European mink (Mustela lutreola) to test whether multiple personality
   trait domains (boldness, exploration and sociability) affected survival
   in two different years and islands. This was done through pre-release
   personality tests and post-release radio-tracking monitoring. Survival
   was positively correlated with boldness, whereas the relationship with
   exploration was either negative or positive depending on year/island.
   The results show a complex relationship between personality and survival
   and suggest that exploration can be maintained over evolutionary time
   via spatiotemporal variation in conditions. However, in contrast to
   exploration, boldness did not vary spatiotemporally and sociability had
   no impact on survival. This indicates that different personality trait
   domains might be maintained by different mechanisms. To date,
   personality has been studied primarily within behavioural sciences, but
   through empirical findings we highlight the importance of personality
   also in ecology and conservation biology.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to participate in a cognitive test may result in sampling biases
   when measuring inter-individual variation in cognitive performances in
   both captive and wild populations. This would be problematic if
   particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate,
   skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We
   presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions,
   with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body
   condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to
   explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific,
   predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test
   sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions,
   yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition.
   Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in
   early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or
   females. While participation among males in high body condition was
   consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females,
   regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later,
   rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable
   behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that
   the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects
   entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely
   available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different
   personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that
   were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more
   likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in
   the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available
   meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to
   participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex,
   body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the
   testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or
   not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling
   biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in
   cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual
   differences in cognition difficult to interpret. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Plovers (subfamily: Charadriinae) are visual foragers that rely on
   ambient light for detection of invertebrates, as demonstrated by their
   foot-stirring behaviour used to stimulate a flight response in prey. At
   night, although ambient light is minimal, predation pressure from
   diurnal raptors is reduced and invertebrate prey availability increases,
   thus creating fitness benefits to nocturnal foraging by invertivores.
   The Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) is a widespread yet understudied
   Plover that primarily inhabits agricultural fields throughout North
   America during the winter. Because nocturnal ambient light is directly
   dependent upon the lunar cycle, I hypothesized that Killdeer exploit
   nights with greater lunar illumination to be able to forage when
   predation risk is low and prey availability is enhanced. I predicted
   that nocturnal activities by Killdeer would be reflected in their
   diurnal behaviour the subsequent day, with decreased diurnal foraging
   following lighter nights. I also considered the additive effect of lower
   ambient temperatures and precipitation. I used an information-theoretic
   framework to compare these hypotheses and found the model with greatest
   support revealed a clear negative relationship between diurnal foraging
   and the amount of lunar illumination the preceding night. Interestingly,
   I found the opposite trend in diurnal roosting behaviour, suggesting
   that if nocturnal light levels suffice, Killdeer forage at night and
   roost during the day. I propose that this behaviour is driven by
   differential predation risk and food availability perceived by Killdeer
   at night vs. day. I also discuss the potential functional importance of
   energetic demands. Taken together, these results highlight the potential
   for avian diurnal behaviour to be closely tied to natural variation in
   nocturnal light availability, a finding with potential relevance to the
   increasing threat of artificial light pollution in our era of
   industrialization.}},

Abstract = {{Binge eating (BE) and drug seeking share similar behavioral features,
   including loss of control over consumption and compulsive seeking of the

   complex interaction between `state' BE, produced by intermittent access
   to a palatable diet, and `trait' BE, a phenotypical proneness towards
   overeating. In the present study, we examined the relationship between
   state and trait BE and cocaine seeking. We used Otsuka Long Evans
   Tokushima Fatty rats, a genetic model for obesity that demonstrates
   BE-like behavior, and Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka controls. They
   received a schedule of limited access to a palatable diet (3 days/week

   cocaine self-administration training (1 mg/kg, 1 hour/day for 10 days)
   followed by extinction sessions (7 days). We found that the degree of
   BE-like behavior and the state and trait BE combination predicted
   cocaine craving patterns. Lower levels of dopamine D2 receptors in the
   prefrontal cortex were correlated with increased drug craving. Moreover,
   restricted access to an attractive diet was found to be a risk factor
   for heightened cocaine craving, particularly in trait binge eaters, as
   rats on the 3 days/week access schedule persistently failed to cease
   cocaine seeking throughout extinction. Hence, we postulate a joint role
   of state and trait BE as risk factors for heightened cocaine craving.}},

Abstract = {{Leadership is an important process shaping collective movement in some
   species. Recent work has demonstrated that experienced or motivated
   individuals can emerge as leaders, and provides insight into the
   mechanisms by which this occurs. Ultimately, leadership depends on the
   effectiveness with which would-be leaders can entrain followers, and
   although the properties of leaders have received much attention, less is
   known about the factors that affect the propensity of their groupmates
   to follow them. Here, the roles of experience and state (hunger) in
   shaping leader and follower behavior were investigated using shoals of
   sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). A first experiment revealed that
   individuals trained to approach a target could entrain and lead their
   naive groupmates out of a refuge toward it, and that they did so more
   effectively when they (the trained fish) were food deprived. In the
   second experiment, the hunger level of the trained fish was held
   constant, whereas that of the naive fish was varied. Here, leadership by
   trained fish was only apparent when the hunger levels of the naive group
   members were intermediate. When naive fish were recently fed, they took
   a long time to visit the target and their arrival times were not
   affected by the presence of a trained individual. Very hungry groups
   recruited to the target most rapidly, but again with no evidence of
   influence by their trained groupmates. These experiments demonstrate
   that leadership in animal groups depends not only on the state and

   crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development,
   throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified
   open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3
   weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or
   response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the
   2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence
   was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet
   versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their
   response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting

   not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic

   that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent

Title = {{The barriers and enablers of healthy eating among young adults: a

Abstract = {{Young adults in Western countries are gaining weight faster than their
   parents and are more likely to gain weight than any other age cohort.
   Despite this, investigation into the complex young adults' food choice
   motives, which enable and prevent healthy eating, has not been widely
   investigated. A scoping review was conducted involving an extensive
   literature search of four major electronic databases: Medline, Embase,
   PsychInfo and CINAHL. Data were collected from 34 articles: study
   descriptions numerically analysed and key findings thematically
   analysed. The key barriers found included: male apathy towards diet;
   unhealthy diet of friends and family; expected consumption of unhealthy
   foods in certain situations; relative low cost of unhealthy foods; lack
   of time to plan, shop, prepare and cook healthy foods; lack of
   facilities to prepare, cook and store healthy foods; widespread presence
   of unhealthy foods; lack of knowledge and skills to plan, shop, prepare
   and cook healthy foods; lack of motivation to eat healthily (including
   risk-taking behaviour). The key enablers found included: female interest
   in a healthy diet; healthy diet of friends and family;
   support/encouragement of friends and family to eat healthy; desire for
   improved health; desire for weight management; desire for improved
   self-esteem; desire for attractiveness to potential partners and others;
   possessing autonomous motivation to eat healthy and existence and use of
   self-regulatory skills. This research provides evidence that can be used
   to tailor interventions for healthy eating and overweight and obesity in
   this population. However, government intervention in addressing food
   access, affordability, marketing and taxation remains essential to any
   significant change.}},

Title = {{Senior consumers and risk/benefit trade-off in functional foods}},
Journal = {{BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1232-1246}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how French senior
   consumers deal with duality between perceived risk and perceived value
   associated with functional foods (FFs) and to analyze whether the
   risk-value trade-off may help to derive different consumer profiles.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 220 senior
   consumers (50-70). A two-step clustering analysis was carried out on
   factor scores of perceived value and perceived risk. Discriminant
   analysis was then employed to verify the classification reliability, and
   analysis of variance was performed to profile the clusters on the basis
   of additional variables.
   Findings - Four distinctive profiles of FF senior consumers were
   identified. Significant differences were found to be attributed to
   personality traits. Interestingly, the ``Trustful enthusiasts{''} and
   the ``Ambivalents{''} consumers do not differ in their repurchase
   intention, despite a significant discrepancy in risk perception.
   Practical implications - The study is an opportunity to offer a
   segmentation of this attractive growing target of health-enhancing
   products. The typology can help the practitioners to find out a new
   valuable scope of messages to better communicate to elderly market.
   Originality/value - The research seeks to contribute to the existing
   knowledge on seniors' nutrition-related behavior, by proposing a
   segmentation still lacking in research works. Since FF perceived value
   appears to be multidimensional and not only utilitarian, the study
   provides a new insight into the experiential approach of
   health-enhancing eating. Also, it shows how the differences between FF
   consumers could be attributed to certain personal variables.}},

Abstract = {{Recognizing which phenotypic traits are predictors for habitat choice

   level of crabs between habitats. Further investigation of phenotypic
   dependency on habitat preference resulted in interactions between origin
   habitat and carapace width and activity level. When split by origin
   habitat, habitat preference for the open mudflat was predicted by body
   size for crabs originating from the open mudflat and by activity level

Journal = {{NORTHERN CLINICS OF ISTANBUL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-123}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine an orthorexia nervosa
   scale score for and evaluate orthorexic tendency among students of
   nutrition and dietetics according to various sociodemographic
   characteristics.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in May and June of
   2016 among 208 students in the nutrition and dietetics department at a
   university in Istanbul. After receiving the approval of the university
   ethics committee, of a total of 300 students, 208 agreed to join the
   study. Participants completed a questionnaire related to individual
   characteristics and the ORTO-11 scale during a face-to-face interview.
   The ORTO-11 scale is a verified Turkish scoring system in which a low
   score indicates orthorexic tendency. The Mann-Whitney U test,
   independent samples t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and analysis of
   variance were used to assess the data. P<0.05 was accepted as
   statistically significant.
   RESULTS: Orthorexic tendency was significantly higher in males (p=0.050)
   and students who lived with their family (p=0.002). Mean ORTHO-11 scale
   score did not differ significantly between groups when the participants
   were grouped by parameters of smoking, alcohol consumption, chronic
   disease status, body mass index, diet observance, or use of nutritional
   supplement products.
   CONCLUSION: The orthorexic tendency was higher in men and in students
   who lived with their family. Additional assessment of individual eating
   habits, eating behavior, and personality characteristics would shed
   light on the reasons for the difference between gender groups.
   Qualitative studies should be carried out and possible confounding
   factors should be determined.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{721-730}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The number of researches that evaluate how behavioural and
   personality issues affect consumers' acceptance and perception of food
   is increasing. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of
   nutritional information and health claims related to soya and cashew nut
   beverages over consumers' acceptance and perception regarding
   nutritional value and healthiness and to verify whether behavioural and
   personality issues affect such evaluation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The samples were evaluated in two phases,
   with (blind phase) and without information (informed phase) about their
   composition, nutritional characteristics and functional claims related
   to some of their ingredients. The sensory evaluation data were analysed
   by means of the analysis of variance for repeated measures, applying 2
   (information) x 2 (beverage) and generalised linear model to evaluate
   the effect of information over the acceptance averages, as well as over
   the perception of healthy food and nutritional value.
   Findings - Information on composition, nutritional characteristics and
   functional claims related to the cashew nut and soya beverages did not
   influence flavour acceptance (p-value = 0.250) and overall impression
   (p-value = 0.316), but had a positive impact on consumers' perception
   regarding healthiness (p-value < 0.001) and nutritious value (p-value <
   0.001) of both beverages, the cashew nut beverage being perceived as
   more nutritious and healthier than the soya beverage. Consumers'
   different characteristics with respect to their interest in healthy
   eating (high and low) and food neophobia (neophiliacs and neophobics)
   did not have any influence on the beverages' acceptance, as well as on
   the perception of healthy food and nutritious value.
   Originality/value - This work compares consumers' acceptance and
   perception regarding nutritional value and healthiness with relation a
   totally unique product in the Brazilian market, and in the world, a new
   functional beverage made from cashew nuts, with a soya-milk beverage.
   Until this moment, there are no studies comparing consumer acceptance
   and perception of products based on hydrosoluble extract-base added with
   fruit juice which evaluate the influence of behavioural and personality
   characteristics of consumers in their perception and acceptance towards

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{821-829}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that predators often influence the foraging behaviour
   of prey through the so-called ``fear effect{''}. However, it is also
   possible that predators could change prey behaviour indirectly by
   altering the prey's food supply through a trophic cascade. The
   predator-sea urchin-kelp trophic cascade is widely assumed to be driven
   by the removal of sea urchins by predators, but changes in sea urchin
   behaviour in response to predators or increased food availability could
   also play an important role. We tested whether increased crevice
   occupancy by herbivorous sea urchins in the presence of abundant
   predatory fishes and lobsters is a response to the increased risk of
   predation, or an indirect response to higher kelp abundances. Inside two
   New Zealand marine reserves with abundant predators and kelp,
   individuals of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus were rarer and
   remained cryptic (i.e. found in crevices) to larger sizes than on
   adjacent fished coasts where predators and kelp are rare. In a mesocosm
   experiment, cryptic behaviour was induced by simulated predation (the
   addition of crushed conspecifics), but the addition of food in the form
   of drift kelp did not induce cryptic behaviour. These findings
   demonstrate that the `fear' of predators is more important than food
   availability in promoting sea urchin cryptic behaviour and suggest that
   both density-and behaviourally mediated interactions are important in
   the predator-sea urchin-kelp trophic cascade.}},

Abstract = {{The exploratory behaviour and the ability of capuchin monkeys to use

   behaviours employed by individuals belonging to a wild group of bearded

   orchids' pseudobulbs and the liquid endosperm of palm nuts. The
   behaviour of wild Sapajus to access water from non-food sources may
   enable them to circumvent the risk of dehydration in environments with
   reduced availability of fleshy fruits and with ephemeral and rare water
   sources. Our findings contribute to the still scarce but accumulating

   was less important when intention was strong. Further, intention was not
   a direct predictor of behaviour when intention was relatively low.
   Action planning was not a direct predictor of either behaviour after

Abstract = {{Introduction: The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating
   disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood.
   Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the
   body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones,
   based both on the anatomic transformation of his/her own body and on the
   social expectation according to the identity.
   The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but
   in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an
   age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years
   (Franzoni et al. 2012).
   Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent
   to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have
   confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes
   precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body
   image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients
   themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the
   realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred
   kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders
   diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age
   there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of
   gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that
   these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into
   predictive factors of a psychopathology.
   We need to build our body image over time; changing our percertion of
   reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we
   strive for changes (Bianchini 2008).
   Method: 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10
   and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school.
   Results: The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15
   years the concern for the body shape is already present, without
   difference between the genders.
   Although 45\% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Raiting Scale
   test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects
   reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong
   concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by
   administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with
   moderate gravity.
   Discussion: Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can
   be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both
   female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close
   attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the
   media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need
   to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with
   prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted.
   Conclusion: The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the
   body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked
   to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support
   for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the
   presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched.
   It would be appreciated if we could introduce in the school, in the
   program of different subjects, the discussion regarding different
   aspects of a healthy nutrition and the formation of a solid self-esteem
   in order, for the students, to have a critical interpretation of the
   media message on food, body and beauty.
   It is desirable to promote the emancipation of the adolescents from a
   condition of dependence to discover their own place in the world. The
   educative action can help developing the research of the meaning of the
   own personality.}},

   to the first year of life, and 62 healthy controls from the same
   classrooms and neighborhoods (mean age +/- SD = 43.8 +/- 2.3 years).
   This cohort has been followed since birth. Using factor analysis and
   comparison with archival data addressing similar constructs, we found
   evidence for reliability and validity of the CTQ-SF in this population.
   Linear regression analyses, with and without adjusting for childhood
   household standard of living at three childhood ages, revealed that a
   history of infant malnutrition was significantly associated with
   increased levels of self-reported physical neglect in childhood, and, to
   a somewhat lesser degree, emotional neglect. This study highlights the
   co-occurrence of infant malnutrition and self-reported maltreatment in
   childhood in Barbados, with potential public health implications.}},

Title = {{How dependent are bell miners (Manorina melanophrys) on lantana (Lantana
   camara) as part of their habitat?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{613-622}},
Abstract = {{Context. The bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) is thought to prefer the
   dense vegetation of Lantana camara, a dominating noxious weed, to nest
   in compared with native plant communities in northern New South Wales
   and southeastern Queensland. As miner numbers seemed to have increased
   with increased availability of nesting habitat, larger numbers of
   despotic bell miners territorially reduce native avian diversity. The
   resultant high insect numbers in the canopy lead to dieback. It is
   unknown to what extent the native bell miner relies on lantana for
   nesting sites and if restoration through removal of lantana, resulting
   in an influx of native species, changes food availability and thus
   foraging behaviours.
   Aims. The objective of our study was to understand the relationship
   between the presence of lantana and bell miners by determining: (1) bell
   miner behaviours in response to different understorey types; (2) bell
   miner nesting choices on a broad scale; (3) nesting preference for each
   site on a broad scale; and (4) whether nest height is related to
   fledging success.
   Methods. Fifty individual bell miners were observed within five colonies
   (four containing comparison quadrats of treated and intact lantana as
   part of a restoration study and one containing water vine for comparison
   as a pristine site; n =10 per treatment) during four seasons. Five bouts
   of gleaning, probing or sallying were observed, noting height and plant
   species. Nest sites were examined over a large area, noting plant
   species present, nest height and plant height.
   Key results. Bell miners used gleaning as the primary foraging tactic
   primarily in eucalypts (93\%; n = 600, mean = 13.6 m +/- 0.29, s.e.).
   Bell miners generally nested in understorey vegetation (83.5\% of nests
   observed) at a mean height of 2.7 m in 37 different plant species,
   native and exotic. Nest height did not influence the probability of
   broods fledging.
   Conclusions. Bell miners exhibit considerable nest plasticity, and the
   removal of lantana as an oft-used nesting habitat is unlikely to lead to
   relocation by this species.}},

Abstract = {{Television (TV) audience research can provide various accurate and
   reliable approaches to investigate TV ratings and viewer behavior.
   However, extant research ignores the issue of how the episodic nature of
   TV watching influences viewer behavior and program selection. The
   purpose of this paper is to elucidate the impact of an audience's
   dynamic decisions under two interactive behaviors: learning behavior and
   forgetting behavior. Learning behavior refers to updating drama quality
   assessment using information, while forgetting behavior disturbs the use
   of information. Based on a deep exploration of viewing behavior in a
   longitudinal context, we construct an innovative methodology employing
   Bayesian rules to model the dynamic process, and test its performance by
   comparing with three benchmark models. Through empirical work of model
   calibration based on the people meter data from the Hong Kong TV
   industry, we show that the learning and forgetting behaviors are two
   important factors determining the fit and predictive ability of our
   model. Some managerial implications are then discussed in order to
   provide useful insights to guide advertiser and TV broadcaster
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by intense preoccupation with
   shape and weight and maladaptive eating practices. The complex of

   expression. This chapter provides an overview of genetic factors acting
   in the etiology of EDs. It then provides a background to the hypothesis
   that epigenetic mechanisms link stresses such as obstetric complications
   and childhood abuse as well as effects of malnutrition to eating
   disorders (EDs). The chapter then summarizes the emerging body of
   literature on epigenetics and EDs-mainly studies on DNA methylation in
   samples of anorexia and bulimia. The available evidence base suggests
   that an epigenetically informed perspective contributes in valuable ways

   behavioural stability}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Behavioural phenotypes vary within and among individuals.
   While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin
   interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental
   factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an
   individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour
   (thereby causing among-individual variation or `personality') and
   within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby
   causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual
   variance or `stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus
   bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the
   expression of these variance components were sex-specific.
   Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial
   design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was
   either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein.
   We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural
   (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits
   (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood.
   Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of
   within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein
   diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and
   behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate
   diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males,
   and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual
   variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein
   diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this
   effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual
   differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in
   female body weight.
   Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that
   dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual
   variance (i.e., individual variation in `behavioural stability') and
   individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., /personality'),
   though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call
   for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on
   the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such
   as behaviour and body weight.}},

   cross-sectional study of food intake and its determinants in older
   adults living in long term care homes}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Older adults living in long term care (LTC) homes are
   nutritionally vulnerable, often consuming insufficient energy, macro-and
   micronutrients to sustain their health and function. Multiple factors
   are proposed to influence food intake, yet our understanding of these
   diverse factors and their interactions are limited. The purpose of this
   paper is to fully describe the protocol used to examine determinants of
   food and fluid intake among older adults participating in the Making the
   Most of Mealtimes (M3) study.
   Methods: A conceptual framework that considers multi-level influences on
   mealtime experience, meal quality and meal access was used to design
   this multi-site cross-sectional study. Data were collected from 639
   participants residing in 32 LTC homes in four Canadian provinces by
   trained researchers. Food intake was assessed with three-days of weighed
   food intake (main plate items), as well as estimations of side dishes,
   beverages and snacks and compared to the Dietary Reference Intake.
   Resident-level measures included: nutritional status, nutritional risk;
   disease conditions, medication, and diet prescriptions; oral health
   exam, signs of swallowing difficulty and olfactory ability; observed
   eating behaviours, type and number of staff assisting with eating; and
   food and foodservice satisfaction. Function, cognition, depression and
   pain were assessed using interRAI LTCF with selected items completed by
   researchers with care staff. Care staff completed a standardized
   person-directed care questionnaire. Researchers assessed dining rooms
   for physical and psychosocial aspects that could influence food intake.
   Management from each site completed a questionnaire that described the
   home, menu development, food production, out-sourcing of food, staffing
   levels, and staff training. Hierarchical regression models, accounting
   for clustering within province, home and dining room will be used to
   determine factors independently associated with energy and protein
   intake, as proxies for intake. Proportions of residents at risk of
   inadequate diets will also be determined.
   Discussion: This rigorous and comprehensive data collection in a large
   and diverse sample will provide, for the first time, the opportunity to
   consider important modifiable factors associated with poor food intake
   of residents in LTC. Identification of factors that are independently
   associated with food intake will help to develop effective interventions
   that support food intake.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that hyponutrition during
   the fetal period increases the risk of mental disorders such as
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism-spectrum disorder,
   which has been experimentally supported using animal models. However,
   previous experimental hyponutrition or protein-restricted (PR) diets
   affected stages other than the fetal stage, such as formation of the egg
   before insemination, milk composition during lactation, and maternal
   nursing behavior.
   Results: We conducted in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in mice
   and allowed PR diet and folic acid-supplemented PR diet to affect only
   fetal environments. Comprehensive phenotyping of PR and control-diet
   progenies showed moderate differences in fear/anxiety-like,
   novelty-seeking, and prosocial behaviors, irrespective of folic-acid
   supplementation. Changes were also detected in gene expression and
   genomic methylation in the brain.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that epigenetic factors in the
   embryo/fetus influence behavioral and epigenetic phenotypes of
   progenies. Significant epigenetic alterations in the brains of the
   progenies induced by the maternal-protein restriction were observed in
   the present study. To our knowledge, this is first study to evaluate the

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{Human activity alters natural habitats for many species. Understanding
   variation in animals' behavioural responses to these changing
   environments is critical. We show how signal detection theory can be
   used within a wider framework of state-dependent modelling to predict
   behavioural responses to a major environmental change: novel, exotic
   species. We allow thresholds for action to be a function of reserves,
   and demonstrate how optimal thresholds can be calculated. We term this
   framework `state-dependent detection theory' (SDDT). We focus on
   behavioural and fitness outcomes when animals continue to use formerly
   adaptive thresholds following environmental change. In a simple example,
   we show that exposure to novel animals which appear dangerous-but are
   actually safe-(e.g. ecotourists) can have catastrophic consequences for
   `prey' (organisms that respond as if the new organisms are predators),
   significantly increasing mortality even when the novel species is not
   predatory. SDDT also reveals that the effect on reproduction can be
   greater than the effect on lifespan. We investigate factors that
   influence the effect of novel organisms, and address the potential for
   behavioural adjustments (via evolution or learning) to recover otherwise
   reduced fitness. Although effects of environmental change are often
   difficult to predict, we suggest that SDDT provides a useful route
   ahead.}},

Abstract = {{How energetic cost of locomotion affects foraging decisions, and its
   metabolic consequences are poorly understood. In several groups of
   animals, including hermit crabs, exploratory walking enhances the
   efficiency of foraging by increasing the probability of finding more and
   better food items; however, the net gain of energy will only be enhanced
   if the costs of walking are lower than the benefits of enhanced food
   acquisition. In hermit crabs, the cost of walking increases with the
   mass of the shell type occupied. Thus, we expected that hermit crabs
   should adjust their foraging strategy to the cost of movement in
   different shells. We assessed the foraging, the quantity and quality of
   food intake, and the energetic cost of maintenance of hermit crabs
   paying different costs of foraging in the wild. The exploratory walking
   negatively correlated with shell mass, showing that hermit crabs use
   different foraging strategies in response to the expenditure required to
   move. Hermit crabs deal with high energetic costs of foraging in heavy
   shells by reduces their exploratory walking and overall metabolic rate,

Abstract = {{Background: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease that is newly
   emerging and behavioral strategies for its prevention are limited.
   Interventions that target the lifestyle behaviors of adolescents, to
   improve poor dietary quality and reduce excessive sedentariness, promise
   to reduce the risk of developing T2D. Health coaching is effective for
   promoting healthy behaviors in patients who have chronic disease, but
   few experimental studies are in adolescents. This randomized controlled
   trial, in adolescents with prediabetes, will determine the effectiveness
   of a health coaching intervention to facilitate adoption of healthy diet
   and activity behaviors that delay or prevent development of T2D.
   Methods/design: The Dietary Intervention for Glucose Tolerance In Teens
   (DIG IT) trial will involve an evaluation of a health coaching
   intervention in adolescents with prediabetes. Eligible participants will
   be randbmized to receive 6 months of health coaching or a single dietary
   consultation that is standard-of-care. The primary outcome will be
   2-hour oral glucose tolerance test concentration. Secondary outcomes
   will include measures of glycemia and insulin action as well as dietary,
   physical activity and sedentary behaviors measured using an electronic
   food record, and by inclinometer. Data will be collected before and
   after the intervention (at 6 months) and at 12 months (to assess
   sustainability).
   Discussion: This trial will determine whether a health coaching
   intervention, a personalized and low-cost approach to modify dietary and
   activity behaviors, is effective and sustainable for prevention of
   youth-onset T2D, relative to standard-of-care. Health coaching has the
   potential to be widely implemented in clinical or community settings.

Abstract = {{The understanding of consistent individual differences in behavior,

   novel environmental conditions has advanced considerably during the last
   decade. However, advancements are almost exclusively associated with
   higher-order animals, whereas studies focusing on smaller aquatic

Abstract = {{Studies conducted in monozygotic and dizygotic twins have established a
   strong genetic component in eating behavior. Rare mutations and common

   obesity and eating behavior scores. However, few studies have assessed

   cross-sectional study in 258 Chilean children (44 \% female, 8-14 years

   (weight, height, Z-score of BMI and waist circumference) were performed

   Absence of Hunger Questionnaire (EAHQ), the Child Eating Behavior
   Questionnaire (CEBQ), the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), and
   the Food Reinforcement Value Questionnaire (FRVQ). Genotype of the

   responsiveness (p value = 0.02) and higher scores of uncontrolled eating
   (p value = 0.01). Obese boys carrying the C allele showed lower

Abstract = {{Sit-and-wait ambushing and active hunting are two strategies used by
   predators to capture prey. In snakes, hunting strategy is conserved
   phylogenetically; most species employ only one strategy. Active hunters
   encounter and capture more prey but invest more energy in hunting and
   have higher risks of being predated. This trade-off is important to
   small predators. The small Cerastes vipera employs both modes of
   hunting, which is unlike most viperids which use only sit-and wait
   ambushing. This species hibernates in October and emerges in April.
   Energy intake should be high prior to hibernation to overcome the
   non-feeding hibernation period and for reproduction on their emergence.
   We predicted that more individuals would hunt actively towards
   hibernation and an abiotic factor would trigger this response.
   Furthermore, since more energy is required for active hunting, we
   predicted that snakes in good body condition would use active hunting to
   a greater extent than snakes in poor body condition. To test our
   predictions, we tracked free-living snakes year round and determined
   their hunting strategy, estimated their body condition index (BCI), and
   calculated circannual parameters of day length as environmental cues
   known to affect animal behaviour. Two novel findings emerged in this
   study, namely, hunting strategy was affected significantly by 1) the
   circannual change in day length and 2) by BCI. The proportion of active
   hunters increased from 5\% in April to over 30\% in October and BCI of
   active foragers was higher than that of sit-and-wait foragers and,
   therefore, our predictions were supported. The entrainment between the
   proportion of active hunting and the abiotic factor is indicative of an
   adaptive function for choosing a hunting strategy. A trend was evident
   among life stages. When all life stages were present
   (September-October), the proportion of active foragers increased with
   age: 0.0\% among neonates, 18.2\% among juveniles and 31.4\% among
   adults. We concluded that vulnerable small neonates used sit-and-wait
   ambush not only as a hunting strategy but also as a hiding technique.

Title = {{An Experimental Approach to Study Individual Differences in Infants'

Journal = {{CHILDHOOD OBESITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-52}},

Abstract = {{Background: As a group, bottle-fed infants are at higher risk for rapid
   weight gain compared with breast-fed infants. However, little is known
   about individual differences in feeding behaviors of bottle-feeding
   infants, as well as maternal and infant characteristics associated with
   bottle-feeding outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted a 2-day, within-subject study of 21
   formula-feeding dyads; the within-subject factor was feeding condition:
   mother-led (ML; mothers were given the instruction to feed their infants
   as they typically would) vs. infant-led (IL; the experimenter ensured
   feeding began when infants signaled hunger and ended when they rejected
   the bottle on three consecutive occasions). Intake was determined by
   bottle weight; feedings were video-recorded and later analyzed to
   determine feeding duration and types of satiation behaviors displayed.
   Percent difference scores were calculated for each outcome as {[}((ML -
   IL)/IL) x 100] to standardize differences among dyads. Mothers completed
   questionnaires of feeding styles and infant temperament.
   Results: On average, infants consumed 42\% more formula during the ML-
   than IL-condition (p=0.03). However, notable variation existed in
   difference scores for intake (range=-52.8\% to 268.9\%; higher scores
   reflect greater intake during ML than IL). Stepwise regression
   illustrated that greater intakes during the ML-condition were predicted
   by the combination of: (1) higher infant age; (2) lower levels of infant
   rhythmicity and adaptability; (3) higher levels of infant positive mood;
   and (4) lower levels of maternal restrictive and responsive feeding
   styles.
   Conclusions: This objective, experimental approach illustrated that
   variation in bottle-feeding outcomes is associated with characteristics
   of both members of the dyad.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Human presence in natural environments is often a source of stress that
   is perceived by large ungulates as an increased risk of predation.
   Alternatively, disturbance induced by hikers creates a relatively
   predator-free space that may serve as a refuge. We measured the
   behavioral responses of female caribou to disturbance associated with
   the presence of hikers during summer in the Gaspesie National Park. We
   used those data to determine whether caribou responded negatively to
   human activity (i.e., the predation risk hypothesis) or whether human
   activity resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of perceived risk
   (i.e., the refuge hypothesis). Female caribou with a calf spent nearly
   half of their time feeding, regardless of the presence of a trail or the
   number of hikers. They also decreased their vigilance near trails when
   the number of hikers increased. Conversely, lone females fed less
   frequently and almost doubled the time invested in vigilance under the
   same circumstances. However, both groups of females moved away from
   trails during the day, especially in the presence of hikers. We
   demonstrated that risk avoidance was specific to the maternal state of
   the individual. Lactating females accommodated the presence of hikers to
   increase time spent foraging and nutritional intake, providing support
   for the refuge hypothesis. Alternatively, lone females with lower
   energetic requirements and no maternal investment in a vulnerable calf
   appeared less tolerant to risk, consistent with the predation risk
   hypothesis. Synthesis and applications: Hikers influenced the
   vigilance-feeding trade-off in caribou, underlining the importance of
   appropriate management of linear structures and human activities,
   especially across the critical habitat of endangered species. Even if
   some individuals seemed to benefit from human presence, this behavioral
   adaptation was not sufficient to reduce annual calf mortality associated
   with predation.}},

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{31-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association
   between immunity and personality. The risk of-parasitism hypothesis
   predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory, risk-taking)
   individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk
   of parasite exposure. In contrast, the pace-of-life hypothesis argues
   that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans
   and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically, associations
   between immunity and personality can arise because personality
   differences are often associated with differences in condition and
   stress responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with
   immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality
   (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three
   indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of
   defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus.
   We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites (none detected),
   chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating
   corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT, in a
   subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of
   natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast
   explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of
   exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This
   suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness
   did not underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style
   did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these
   results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune
   function in more proactive individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review This review examines the concepts of fussy eating and
   food neophobia in the context of key determinants of the development of
   children's food preferences. We discuss the evidence for genetic versus
   parental and other environmental influences on the ontogeny of these
   behavioural traits and the implications of current knowledge for
   interventions that attempt to lessen the impact of these traits on
   children's diets. Finally, we consider whether these traits increase the
   risk of a child becoming obese, or alternatively, underweight and
   malnourished.
   Recent Findings Fussy eating and neophobia are related concepts with
   both genetic and environmental aetiologies. Parentchild correlations and
   heritability estimates are moderate to high for both traits, but aspects
   of the family environment remain influential in young children, although
   no longer in young adults. Parental strategies based around repeat
   tasting opportunities can improve acceptance of disliked foods in even
   the fussiest children. Fussy eating and neophobia are not risk factors
   for obesity but could limit growth in severe cases.
   Summary Fussy eating and food neophobia are common concerns for parents,
   though health risks are low. Dissemination of evidence-based strategies
   to parents that can encourage a more varied diet in young children would
   be helpful.}},

Abstract = {{Rothbart's model of temperament, defined as individual differences in
   reactivity and self-regulation, has a strong heuristic value with
   applications in a wide variety of children's outcomes. Our objective was
   to test Rothbart's model applied to children's food behaviours and BMI
   outcome through behavioural measures. Our hypotheses, according to
   Rothbart's model, were as follows: (i) self-regulation in eating
   modulates appetite reactivity; (ii) appetite reactivity increases the
   risk of excess BMI, whereas self regulation in eating limits this risk.
   One hundred and four children aged between 7 and 12 years completed four
   behavioural tasks to assess scores for two components of appetite
   reactivity (i.e. appetite arousal and appetite persistence) and two
   components of self-regulation in eating (i.e. self-regulation in eating
   without hunger and self-regulation in eating speed). Their heights and
   weights were measured in order to calculate their BMI-for-age. T-tests
   and regression analysis were used to verify our hypotheses. None of the
   scores of self-regulation in eating was directly associated with BMI but
   we observed a significant impact of self-regulation in eating without
   hunger on appetite arousal (p-value = 0.04), together with a modest but
   significant association between appetite persistence and BMI (p value =
   0.02). We can thus conclude that our behavioural measures could be used
   for the determination of the child's eating temperament. Further studies
   are needed to investigate how to use these measures to improve the
   treatment of overweight in children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In social insects, the efficiency of exploitation of resources and
   colony defence are mediated by chemical communication. In colonies
   dependent on nutritionally limited resources, corpses represent both a
   food resource and a risk of pathogens. Because this risk vs. reward
   changes with time after death, behavioural plasticity in the response to
   corpses would be advantageous. How social insects regulate this
   trade-off remains unknown. We conducted quantitative behavioural
   bioassay and chemical analysis to study corpse management in the eastern
   subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We hypothesized that R.
   flavipes responds differently towards corpses with prolonged post-mortem
   time, and this behavioural plasticity is mediated by the dynamic change
   in death cues. We show that R. flavipes uses a post-mortem signalling
   system that depends on an early death cue that stimulates corpse
   retrieval and cannibalism, and late death cues that stimulate
   recruitment and burial. A blend of 3-octanone and 3-octanol is released
   immediately after death, with the alcohol (possibly in conjunction with
   the ketone) playing a clear role as a death cue. This cue enables the
   colony to recycle nutrients before decomposition occurs and before risk
   of pathogens increases. The accumulation of late death cues,
   decomposition products shared by diverse arthropods, elicits a
   behavioural switch from cannibalism to burial. The ability to detect and
   respond to the dead is vital to group-living animals. Our study reveals
   a behavioural shift in corpse management triggered by the interplay of
   an early death cue and late death cues, which balances risks and rewards
   associated with corpses. The post-mortem chemical communication
   highlights the adaptation of a social insect to its ecological niche.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{243}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Many species show individual variation in neophobia and stress hormones,
   but the causes and consequences of this variation in the wild are
   unclear. Variation in neophobia levels could affect the number of
   offspring animals produce, and more subtly influence the rearing
   environment and offspring development. Nutritional deficits during
   development can elevate levels of stress hormones that trigger longterm
   effects on learning, memory, and survival. Therefore measuring offspring
   stress hormone levels, such as corticosterone (CORT), helps determine if
   parental neophobia influences the condition and developmental trajectory
   of young. As a highly neophobic species, jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are
   excellent for exploring the potential effects of parental neophobia on
   developing offspring. We investigated if neophobic responses, alongside
   known drivers of fitness, influence nest success and offspring hormone
   responses in wild breeding jackdaws. Despite its consistency across the
   breeding season, and suggestions in the literature that it should have
   importance for reproductive fitness, parental neophobia did not predict
   nest success, provisioning rates or offspring hormone levels. Instead,
   sibling competition and poor parental care contributed to natural
   variation in stress responses. Parents with lower provisioning rates
   fledged fewer chicks, chicks from larger broods had elevated baseline
   CORT levels, and chicks with later hatching dates showed higher
   stress-induced CORT levels. Since CORT levels may influence the
   expression of adult neophobia, variation in juvenile stress responses
   could explain the development and maintenance of neophobic variation
   within the adult population. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The distribution of latencies and interresponse times (IRTs) of rats was
   compared between two fixed-interval (FI) schedules of food reinforcement
   (FI 30 s and FI 90 s), and between two levels of food deprivation.
   Computational modeling revealed that latencies and IRTs were well
   described by mixture probability distributions embodying two-state
   Markov chains. Analysis of these models revealed that only a subset of
   latencies is sensitive to the periodicity of reinforcement, and
   prefeeding only reduces the size of this subset. The distribution of
   IRTs suggests that behavior in FI schedules is organized in bouts that
   lengthen and ramp up in frequency with proximity to reinforcement.
   Prefeeding slowed down the lengthening of bouts and increased the time
   between bouts. When concatenated, latency and IRT models adequately
   reproduced sigmoidal FI response functions. These findings suggest that
   behavior in FI schedules fluctuates in and out of schedule control; an
   account of such fluctuation suggests that timing and motivation are
   dissociable components of FI performance. These mixture-distribution
   models also provide novel insights on the motivational, associative, and

   obscured, however, when performance in timing tasks is analyzed in terms

Abstract = {{Background: We assessed the impact of a family history of diabetes on
   type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and behavioral traits in young

   Methods: Subjects aged 25-44 years were included, and the presence of a

   (the Korea National Health and Nutrition Survey 2010). We compared the
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and other
   metabolic parameters, including blood pressure and lipid profile.
   Results: Of 2059 participants, those with a family history of diabetes
   involving first-degree relatives (n = 489, 23.7\%) had a significantly
   higher prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (14.3 vs. 11.7\%) and type
   2 diabetes (6.7 vs. 1.8\%), compared to those without a family history
   (P < 0.001). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (21.3 vs. 12.1\%, P <
   0.001) and its components (except for high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol) were greater in subjects with a family history of diabetes.
   Among subjects exhibiting normal glucose tolerance (n = 1704), those

Abstract = {{In most countries producing milk, industry-or other stakeholder-driven
   initiatives are in place to improve welfare and overall dairy farming
   sustainability. Those initiatives typically include a system of
   verification of reaching targets and progress over time. Reliable
   indicators are a fundamental requirement to provide public assurance and
   allow improvement on farms. Assessing dairy cattle welfare through
   outcome measures of welfare is done today through visual evaluations,
   including those of lameness, injuries, hygiene, and body condition.
   Numerical scoring charts for visual evaluation have been validated, and
   training programs have been developed to achieve high repeatability of
   assessors. Sampling strategies have been validated to determine how many
   animals and how many days are required to obtain reliable estimates of
   prevalence. However, visual evaluations require long periods of data
   collection, and multiple visits on farm, along with repeated checks of
   assessors to ensure repeatability over time, are, in turn, very costly
   to implement. An attractive alternative is relying on automated measures
   as activity monitors are becoming common on commercial farms; among
   those, lying time retains the most attention. The use of herd lying time
   in both freestall and tie-stall situations has been validated. Current
   research is looking at relationships between lying time and other
   outcome measures of welfare, as well as lying time and risk factors for
   welfare in the environment (e.g., poor stall configuration or hoof
   trimming routine). We are not quite yet ready to rely solely on lying
   time to assess welfare; however, activity monitoring could certainly
   contribute to early detection of health and welfare issues (e.g.,
   frequency of visits to the robotic milking system). Another interesting
   avenue is the development of early outcome measures of welfare and,
   possibly, remote indicators, for example, performance data collected
   routinely in Dairy Herd Improvement agencies' databases. The rationale
   is that a herd with good health and high longevity should be at lower
   risk of poor welfare. Research is needed to identify predictors and
   their conditions of use, allowing us to discriminate good vs. poor
   welfare status, at both the individual and herd levels. Finally, milk
   samples are already collected routinely to check quality and safety. It
   would be convenient to be able to predict cow welfare status directly
   with the milk using biomarkers, but again, we are not there yet.}},

Abstract = {{Moving shadows signify imminent threat to foraging juvenile crayfish,
   and the animals respond with one of two discrete anti-predatory
   behaviors: They either freeze in place or rapidly flex their tails,
   which quickly propels them away from the approaching danger signal.
   Although a freeze might be the more risky choice, it keeps the animal
   near the expected food reward, while a tail-flip is effective in
   avoiding the shadow, but puts critical distance between the animal and
   its next meal. We manipulated the satiation level of juvenile crayfish
   to determine whether their behavioral choices are affected by internal
   energy states. When facing the same visual danger signal, animals fed to
   satiation produced more tail-flips and fewer freezes than unfed animals,
   indicating that intrinsic physiological conditions shape value-based
   behavioral decisions. Escape tail-flip latencies, however, were
   unaffected by satiation level, and an increase in food quality only

Title = {{Association of the dopamine D2 receptor rs1800497 polymorphism and
   eating behavior in Chilean children}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Studies have established a strong genetic component in
   eating behavior. The Taql Al polymorphism (rs1800497) has previously
   been associated with obesity and eating behavior. Additionally, this
   polymorphism has been associated with diminished dopamine D2 receptor
   (DRD2) density, higher body mass, and food reinforcement. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the association between the DRD2 rs1800497
   polymorphism and eating behavior in Chilean children.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which we selected 258
   children (44\% girls, 56\% boys; ages 8-14 y) with a wide variation in
   body mass index. Anthropometric measurements were performed by standard
   procedures. Eating behavior was assessed using the Eating in Absence of
   Hunger Questionnaire (EAHQ), Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and
   the Food Reinforcement Value Questionnaire. Genotype of the rs1800497
   was determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length
   polymorphism. Association of the Taql Al variant (T allele) with eating
   behavior was assessed using nonparametric tests.
   Results: Compared with normal -weight children, the obese group
   demonstrated higher scores on the External Eating and Fatigue/Boredom
   subscales of the EAHQ. Higher scores were assessed in Food
   Responsiveness, Emotional Overeating, Enjoyment to Food and Desire to
   Drink subscales (P < 0.001) and lower scores of the Satiety
   Responsiveness and Slowness in Eating (P < 0.05). In the sex -specific
   analysis, the Taql Al allele was associated with higher scores on
   Satiety Responsiveness and Emotional Undereating subscales in obese
   girls, and higher scores of Enjoyment of Food subscale in boys.
   Conclusion: The Taql Al polymorphism may be a risk factor for eating
   behavior traits that may predispose children to greater energy intake
   and obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-taking decisions in front of a predator are crucial for the fitness
   of the animals. Risk-taking behaviour can be hypothesised to depend on
   escape ability, which is difficult to study in the wild. In this field
   study, we investigated whether escape ability (i) is a consistent
   individual-specific characteristic and (ii) can explain
   between-individual variation in risktaking behaviour in male collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We estimated escape ability by the
   time that was needed to capture individuals by hand in an outdoor aviary
   during both the courtship and the nestling feeding phases. We estimated
   risk-taking by human-induced flight initiation distance (FID) and
   parental nest-defence behaviour. We also measured variables that reflect
   individual quality and condition to assess how these affect escape
   ability. Time to capture was weakly repeatable in the within-and
   between-season contexts, but was considerably repeatable within a day.
   We found that time to capture decreased between courtship and nestling
   feeding phases, probably due to parallel changes in body condition (as
   shown by the systematic decline of individual body mass between phases
   correlating with within-individual changes in time to capture). Overall,
   time to capture was not significantly related to risk-taking behaviour,
   but we found a negative correlation between time to capture and FID in
   yearlings. In conclusion, escape ability in flycatchers seems to be a
   condition-dependent plastic trait, and it has the potential to affect
   immediate risk-taking decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Predators can influence prey traits and behavior (nonconsumptive effects
   {[}NCEs]), often with cascading effects for basal resources and
   ecosystem function. But critiques of NCE experiments suggest that their
   duration and design produce results that describe the potential
   importance of NCEs rather than their actual importance. In light of
   these critiques, we re-evaluated a toadfish (predator), crab (prey), and
   oyster (resource) NCE-mediated trophic cascade. In a 4-month field
   experiment, we varied toadfish cue (NCE) and crab density
   -(approximating variation in predator consumptive effects, CE). Toadfish
   initially benefitted oyster survival by causing crabs to reduce
   consumption. But this NCE weakened over time (possibly due to prey
   hunger), so that after 2 months, crab density (CE) dictated oyster
   survivorship, regardless of cue. However, the NCE ultimately re-emerged
   on reefs with a toadfish cue, increasing oyster survivorship. At no
   point did the effect of toadfish cue on mud crab foraging behavior alter
   oyster population growth or sediment organic matter on the reef, which
   is a measure of benthic-pelagic coupling. Instead, both decreased with
   increasing crab density. Thus, within a system shown to exhibit strong
   NCEs in short-term experiments (days) our study supported predictions
   from theoretical models: (a) within the generation of individual prey,
   the relative influence of NCEs appears to cycle over longer time periods
   (months); and (b) predator CEs, not NCEs, drive longer-term resource
   dynamics and ecosystem function. Thus, our study implies that the
   impacts of removing top predators via activities such as hunting and
   overfishing will cascade to basal resources and ecosystem properties
   primarily through density-mediated interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Rats and mice exposed to repeated stress or a single severe stress
   exhibit a sustained increase in energetic, endocrine, and behavioral

   standard dose of CRF. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 3 h of
   restraint on each of 3 consecutive days (RRS) or were non-restrained

   body weight. Eight days after the end of restraint, rats received
   increasing third ventricle doses of CRF (03.0 mu g). The lowest dose of

Abstract = {{Objective: A meeting of multidisciplinary biobehavioral scientists and
   National Institutes of Health (NIH) program staff was convened by the
   Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, Division of Program
   Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, Office of the
   Director, NIH to examine mechanisms associated with humans' ability to
   self-regulate appetite and appetitive behavior.
   Methods: Based upon prior discussions of the NIH Obesity Research Task
   Force Behavioral Phenotyping Work Group, the premise was adopted that,
   in modern society, multiple factors on multiple levels interact to
   create circumstances wherein self-control of appetite is difficult,
   leading to overconsumption of unhealthy foods versus healthy eating
   patterns, contributing to our current levels of obesity. Through
   presentations and group discussions, the panel examined how foundational
   processes/ mechanisms directly and indirectly affect appetitive behavior
   and how these processes can be manipulated to affect food intake and
   thereby weight. The meeting identified evidence-based mechanisms with
   the potential to impact self-regulation of appetite and appetitive
   states (hunger, satiety, food wanting, restraint, reward) and associated
   behaviors such as overconsumption, eating in the absence of hunger, food
   seeking, and decision-making that could inform novel weight intervention
   strategies in free-living, nonlaboratory settings.
   Conclusion: The three summary papers contained in this issue represent
   the synthesis of the material presented at the meeting and the panel's
   recommendations on how existing evidence regarding mechanisms and
   pathways to appetitive behavior can be used to inform future research

   BackgroundExcess dietary sodium and fluid intake are risk factors
   contributing to the worsening and rehospitalisation for heart failure in
   older patients. Managing the complex fluid and diet requirements of
   heart failure patients is challenging and is made more complicated by
   cultural variations in self-management behaviours in response to a
   health threat.
   DesignQualitative study using semi-structured in interviews and
   framework analysis.
   MethodsThe design of this study is qualitative descriptive.
   Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 heart failure
   patients. Data were analysed through content analysis.
   ResultsSeven cultural themes emerged from the qualitative data: the
   values placed on health and illness, customary way of life, preference
   for folk care and the Chinese healthcare system, and factors related to
   kinship and social ties, religion, economics and education.
   ConclusionsDietary change and management in response to illness,
   including heart failure, is closely related to individuals' cultural
   background. Healthcare providers should have a good understanding of
   cultural aspects that can influence patients' conformity to medical
   recommendations.
   Relevance to clinical practiceHeart failure patients need support that
   considers their cultural needs. Healthcare providers must have a good
   understanding of the experiences of people from diverse cultural

Abstract = {{The global increase in rates of obesity has been accompanied by a
   similar surge in the number of autism diagnoses. Accumulating
   epidemiological evidence suggest a possible link between overweight and
   the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as autism
   severity. In laboratory animals, several studies have shown a connection
   between various environmental factors, including diet induced obesity,
   and the development of autism-related behaviors. However, the effect of
   high-fat or imbalanced diet on a pre-existing autism-like phenotype is
   unclear. In this study, we employed the BTBR inbred mouse strain, a well
   established mouse model for autism, to assess the impact of inadequate
   fattening nutrition on the autism-related behavioral phenotype. Male
   mice were fed by high-fat diet (HFD) or control balanced diet (control)
   from weaning onward, and tested in a series of behavioral assays as
   adults. In addition, we measured the hypothalamic expression levels of
   several genes involved in oxytocin and dopamine signaling, in search of
   a possible neurobiological underlying mechanism. As an internal control,
   we also employed similar metabolic and behavioral measures on
   neurotypical C57 mice. Compared to control-fed mice, BTBR mice fed by
   HFD showed marked aggravation in autism-related behaviors, manifested in
   increased cognitive rigidity and diminished preference for social
   novelty. Moreover, the total autism composite (severity) score was
   higher in the HFD group, and positively correlated with higher body
   weight. Finally, we revealed negative correlations associating dopamine
   signaling factors in the hypothalamus, to autism-related severity and
   body weight. In contrast, we found no significant effects of HFD on
   autism-related behaviors of C57 mice, though the metabolic effects of
   the diet were similar for both strains. Our results indicate a direct
   causative link between diet-induced obesity and worsening of a
   pre-existing autism-related behavior and emphasize the need for adequate
   nutrition in ASD patients. These findings might also implicate the
   involvement of hypothalamic dopamine in mediating this effect.}},

   We addressed the hypothesis that larval success is associated with

   We used chl-a conditions found on coral reefs (0.1-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1),
   including nominal threshold levels for disproportionate larval success
   (>= 1.0 mu g chl-a L-1). High success to the juvenile occurred across an
   order of magnitude of chl-a concentrations (0.5-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1),
   suggesting there may not be a narrow value for optimal success.
   Oligotrophic conditions (0.1 mu g chl-a L-1) appeared to be a critical

Abstract = {{Common reports of over-response to food cues, difficulties with calorie

   eating behaviors could be interrelated in ways that influence weight
   management efforts. The feasibility of identifying robust eating
   phenotypes (showing face, content, and criterion validity) was explored
   based on well-validated individual eating behavior assessments. Adults
   (n = 260; mean age 34 years) completed online questionnaires with
   measurements of nine eating behaviors including: appetite for palatable
   foods, binge eating, bitter taste sensitivity, disinhibition, food
   neophobia, pickiness and satiety responsiveness. Discovery-based
   visualization procedures that have the combined strengths of heatmaps
   and hierarchical clustering were used to investigate: 1) how eating
   behaviors cluster, 2) how participants can be grouped within eating
   behavior clusters, and 3) whether group clustering is associated with
   body mass index (BMI) and dietary self efficacy levels. Two distinct
   eating behavior clusters and participant groups that aligned within
   these clusters were identified: one with higher drive to eat and another
   with food avoidance behaviors. Participants' BMI (p = 0.0002) and
   dietary self-efficacy (p < 0.0001) were associated with cluster
   membership. Eating behavior clusters showed content and criterion

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The regulation of gene expression in response to environmental and
   behavioural cues is critical for many biological processes. Histone tail
   modifications are dynamic and, as such, can regulate gene expression in
   response to extracellular conditions. Many of the enzymes involved in
   adding and removing these modifications require cofactors that are
   products of intermediary metabolism pathways, thus linking cellular
   metabolism to the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, the
   expression and activity of such enzymes are influenced by the cellular
   concentrations of metabolic products. Under- and overnutrition can
   induce epigenetic changes that influence chromatin structure and define
   a metabolic program. Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that
   such changes during the pre- and perinatal periods can be long- lasting,
   influencing the disease risk later in life and could be transmitted to
   subsequent generations. Moreover, damaging gene expression patterns
   observed in metabolic diseases such as diabetes are driven by persistent

   grasshopper survival decreased with increased temperature when no
   spiders were present. When spiders were present, grasshopper survival
   was reduced, and this effect was strongest in the cooled treatment. In
   contrast, grasshopper survival did not vary significantly with spider
   presence or among temperature treatments at low grasshopper densities.
   Our results indicate that context-dependent species interactions are
   common and highlight the importance of understanding how and when key
   biotic and abiotic factors combine to influence species interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The arid and semi-arid zones of Australia are characterized by highly
   variable and unpredictable environmental conditions which affect
   resources for flora and fauna. Environments which are highly
   unpredictable in terms of both resource access and distribution are
   likely to select for a variety of adaptive behavioral strategies,
   intrinsically linked to the physiological control of behavior. How
   unpredictable resource distribution has affected the coevolution of
   behavioral strategies and physiology has rarely been quantified,
   particularly not in Australian birds. We used a captive population of
   wild-derived zebra finches to test the relationships between behavioral
   strategies relating to food access and physiological responses to stress
   and body condition. We found that individuals that were in poorer body
   condition and had higher peak corticosterone levels entered baited
   feeders earlier in the trapping sequence of birds within the colony. We
   also found that individuals in poorer body condition fed in smaller
   social groups. Our data show that the foraging decisions which
   individuals make represent not only a trade-off between food access and
   risk of exposure, but their underlying physiological response to stress.
   Our data also suggest fundamental links between social networks and
   physiological parameters, which largely remain untested. These data
   demonstrate the fundamental importance of physiological mechanisms in
   controlling adaptive behavioral strategies and the dynamic interplay
   between physiological control of behavior and life-history evolution.

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding biology of the south temperate Cape Penduline
   Tit (Anthoscopus minutus) in order to compare its life history traits
   with those of related north temperate members of the family Remizidae,
   namely the Eurasian Penduline Tit (Remiz pendulinus) and the Verdin
   (Auriparus flaviceps). We used this comparison to test key predictions
   of three hypotheses thought to explain latitudinal variation in life
   histories among bird species-the seasonality and food limitation
   hypothesis, nest predation hypothesis and adult mortality hypothesis.
   Contrary to the general pattern of smaller clutch size and lower adult
   mortality among south-temperate birds living in less seasonal
   environments, the Cape Penduline Tit has a clutch size larger than that
   of the Verdin and similar to that of the Eurasian Penduline Tit, and
   higher adult mortality than both of the other two species. The most
   notable difference between the Cape Penduline Tit and the two other
   species is in parental behavioural strategy, with the former exhibiting
   bi-parental care at all stages of nesting together with facultative
   cooperative breeding, whereas the Eurasian Penduline Tit has
   uni-parental care and the Verdin has a combination of female-only
   incubation but bi-parental nestling care. Consequently, in comparison to
   the other two species, the Cape Penduline Tit exhibits greater nest
   attentiveness during incubation, a similar per-nestling feeding rate and
   greater post-fledging survival. Its relatively large clutch size, high
   parental investment and associated high adult mortality in a less
   seasonal environment are consistent with key predictions of the adult
   mortality hypothesis but not with key predictions of the seasonality and
   food limitation hypothesis in explaining life history variation among
   Remizidae species. These results add to a growing body of evidence of
   the importance of age-specific mortality in shaping life history
   evolution.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{150-159}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ignoring the inertia effects on transport-mode choice behavior may lead
   to erroneous decisions in transport policy. Around changes in the
   transport system, the majority of studies on inertia have relied on
   combining Revealed Preferences (RP) and Stated Preferences (SP) obtained
   prior to the introduction of new transport modes and measuring inertia
   as the effect that the real choices have on the choices in the
   hypothetical new scenarios. In this study, we analyze the role of the
   inertia using a novel panel data from the same set of individuals
   composed of two waves. The first wave was gathered before a new tram
   came into service and consisted of a RP survey and a SP survey which
   included the new public tram as a hypothetical alternative. The second
   wave consisted of a RP survey conducted two years later, after the tram
   started operating. Using these two waves, we estimate panel mixed logit
   models and found a significant inertia effect only between the RP waves
   which, having accounted for changes in other factors, increases the
   probability of choosing the car after the tram implementation. However,
   we did not find inertia effect on SP, hence taking into account only the
   RP-SP outcomes before tram might have led to wrong conclusions about the
   effect of the transport intervention on the modal share. Furthermore, we
   compare models with and without inertia effect and conclude that the
   models with inertia provide better fit to data, smaller direct car
   elasticities and increasing asymmetric effects between the car and

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial
   tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These
   tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and
   incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling
   framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional
   resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat
   quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used
   to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on
   two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we
   computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using
   different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and
   the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in
   heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance
   led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model
   in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not
   considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall
   representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition,
   connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality
   produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual
   components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through
   additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods,
   areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent
   locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of
   regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions.
   The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be
   modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes.
   It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the
   potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.}},

Volume = {{205}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1373-1397}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including
   low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to
   conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for
   understanding the molecular nature of circadian (similar to 24 hr)
   rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of
   circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current
   understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila
   and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and
   timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens
   developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own
   transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately
   timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and
   function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the
   circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases,
   act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and
   accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain
   that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to
   translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss
   how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in
   allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral
   outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral
   responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF
   provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons,
   although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still
   being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence
   rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian
   clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and
   quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a
   homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for
   identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci
   important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep
   regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for
   catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like
   regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in
   flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by
   factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We
   are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons
   interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep.
   Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic
   understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory,
   courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these
   behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel
   molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian
   rhythms.}},

Abstract = {{King rails experience a wide range of temperatures during the course of
   the breeding season throughout their rapidly contracting geographic
   range. Incubating parent birds are adapted to keep their eggs within a
   temperature range appropriate for embryo development, but king rail
   clutches are at risk of exceeding lethal temperatures in the latter half
   of the nesting season. We investigated whether behavioral plasticity
   during incubation enables parents to maintain clutch temperature within
   tolerable limits for embryo development. Video revealed that king rail
   parents interrupted incubation to stand above and shade their eggs. We
   tested the hypothesis that the onset of shading was a direct response to
   ambient temperature (adaptive plasticity). We monitored clutch
   temperature directly by experimentally adding into clutches a model egg
   embedded with a programmable iButton. We measured ambient temperature at
   the nest site simultaneously. Parents spent proportionately more time
   shading and less time incubating their eggs at higher ambient
   temperatures. Shading may primarily function in cooling the parent. The
   frequency and duration of shading bouts were significantly greater at
   higher ambient temperatures. Parents also took more frequent but shorter
   recesses in hotter conditions. Diurnal recesses exposed eggs to direct
   sunlight, and the highest clutch temperatures were recorded under these
   conditions. Complete hatching failure in at least one nest was
   attributable to high clutch temperature for an extended period. Because
   mean ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season, we
   investigated seasonal patterns in onset of incubation and its effect on
   hatching rate. Later in the season, parents tended to initiate
   incubation earlier, and hatching asynchrony increased significantly.
   Together these results suggest that breeding king rails may be
   constrained in their ability to cope with sustained high temperatures
   should seasonal averages continue to rise as predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Glucose is considered the primary energy source for all cells, and some
   cancers are addicted to glucose. Here, we investigated the functional
   consequences of chronic glucose deprivation in serous ovarian cancer
   cells. We found that cells resistant to glucose starvation
   (glucose-restricted cells) demonstrated increased metabolic plasticity
   that was dependent on NNMT (Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase)
   expression. We further show that ZEB1 induced NNMT, rendered cells
   resistant to glucose deprivation and recapitulated metabolic adaptations
   and mesenchymal gene expression observed in glucose-restricted cells.
   NNMT depletion reversed metabolic plasticity in glucoserestricted cells
   and prevented de novo formation of glucose-restricted colonies. In
   addition to its role in glucose independence, we found that NNMT was
   required for other ZEB1-induced phenotypes, such as increased migration.
   NNMT protein levels were also elevated in metastatic and recurrent
   tumors compared to matched primary carcinomas, while normal ovary and
   fallopian tube tissue had no detectable NNMT expression. Our studies
   define a novel ZEB1/ NNMT signaling axis, which elicits mesenchymal gene

Abstract = {{Addiction is a mental illness in which psychiatric conditions imply a
   prominent burden. Psychopathological symptoms in substance use disorder
   (SUD) patients are usually viewed as being assignable to the sphere of a
   personality trait or of comorbidity, leaving doubts about the presence
   of a specific psychopathology that could only be related to the
   toxicomanic process. Our research group at the University of Pisa has
   shed light on the possible definition of a specific psychopathological
   dimension in SUDs. In heroin use disorder patients, performing an
   exploratory principal component factor analysis (PCA) on all the 90
   items included in the SCL-90 questionnaire led to a five-factor
   solution. The first factor accounted for a depressive ``worthlessness
   and being trapped{''} dimension; the second factor picked out a ``
   somatic symptoms{''} dimension; the third identified a
   ``sensitivity-psychoticism{''} dimension; the fourth a
   ``panic-anxiety{''} dimension; and the fifth a `` violence-suicide{''}
   dimension. These same results were replicated by applying the PCA to
   another Italian sample of 1,195 heroin addicts entering a Therapeutic

   symptoms, independently of demographic and clinical characteristics,
   active heroin use, lifetime psychiatric problems, kind of treatment
   received, and, especially, other substances used by the patient such as
   alcohol or cocaine. Moreover, these clusters were able to discriminate
   patients affected by addiction from those affected by psychiatric
   diseases such as major depressive disorder. Our studies seem to suggest
   the trait-dependent, rather than the state-dependent, nature of the
   introduced psychopathology dimensions of SUDs.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent psychiatric patients are vulnerable to weight problems and
   show an overrepresentation of overweight compared to the healthy
   population. One potential factor that can contribute to the etiology of
   overweight is higher impulsivity. As of yet, it is unclear whether it is
   a general impulse control deficit or weight-related aspects such as
   lower impulse control in response to food that have an impact on body
   weight. As this may have therapeutic implications, the current study
   investigated differences between overweight and non-overweight
   adolescent psychiatric inpatients (N = 98; aged 12-20) in relation to
   trait impulsivity and behavioral inhibition performance. The Barratt
   Impulsiveness Scale and two go/no-go paradigms with neutral and
   food-related stimulus materials were applied. Results indicated no
   significant differences concerning trait impulsivity, but revealed that
   overweight inpatients had significantly more difficulties in inhibition
   performance (i.e. they reacted more impulsively) in response to both
   food and neutral stimuli compared to non-overweight inpatients.
   Furthermore, no specific inhibition deficit for high-caloric vs.
   low-caloric food cues emerged in overweight inpatients, whereas
   non-overweight participants showed significantly lower inhibition skills
   in response to high-caloric than low-caloric food stimuli. The results
   highlight a rather general, non-food-specific reduced inhibition
   performance in an overweight adolescent psychiatric population. Further
   research is necessary to enhance the understanding of the role of

Abstract = {{Cognitive performance is based on brain functions, which have energetic
   demands and are modulated by physiological parameters such as metabolic
   hormones. As both environmental demands and environmental energy
   availability change seasonally, we propose that cognitive performance in
   free-living animals might also change seasonally due to phenotypic
   plasticity. This is part of an emerging research field, the
   `ecophysiology of cognition': environmentally induced changes in
   physiological traits, such as blood glucose and hormone levels, are
   predicted to influence cognitive performance in free-living animals.
   Energy availability for the brain might change, and as such cognition,
   with changing energetic demands (e.g. reproduction) and changes of
   energy availability in the environment (e.g. winter, drought).
   Individuals spending more energy than they can currently obtain from
   their environment (allostatic overload type I) are expected to trade off
   energy investment between cognition and other life-sustaining processes
   or even reproduction. Environmental changes reducing energy availability
   might thus impair cognition. However, selection pressures such as
   predation risk, mate choice or social demands may act on the trade-off
   between energy saving and cognition. We assume that different
   environmental conditions can lead to three different trade-off outcomes:
   cognitive impairment, resilience or enhancement. Currently we cannot
   understand these trade-offs, because we lack information about changes
   in cognitive performance due to seasonal changes in energy availability
   and both the resulting changes in homeostasis (for example, blood
   glucose levels) and the associated changes in the mechanisms of
   allostasis (for example, hormone levels). Additionally, so far we know
   little about the fitness consequences of individual variation in
   cognitive performance. General cognitive abilities, such as attention
   and associative learning, might be more important in determining fitness
   than complex and specialized cognitive abilities, and easier to use for
   comparative study in a large number of species. We propose to study
   seasonal changes in cognitive performance depending on energy
   availability in populations facing different predation risks, and the
   resulting fitness consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Changes in food availability usually have an effect on the
   fitness-related traits of anuran larvae, such as body shape,
   developmental rate, and body size.
   Organism: Hypsiboas pulchellus, the South American common tree frog.
   Aim: Analyse the effect of food availability on larval survival,
   developmental rate (Gosner stage at the end of the experiment), body
   size (body mass and total length), body shape (the ratio between body
   length and total length), and intestine size (gut dry mass and gut
   length).
   Methods: We exposed tadpoles of H. pulchellus, all from a single clutch,
   to different levels of food availability. We set up eight food
   availability groups of five individuals each. After 39 days, we measured
   all phenotypic variables studied. We used linear and logistic
   regressions to analyse the data. We also used a structural equation
   modelling approach to evaluate the likelihood of ten causal models of
   covariation among the phenotypic traits (derived from four major
   biological hypotheses).
   Results: Three traits were observed to vary positively with food
   availability: developmental stage, body size, and gut size. Tadpole
   survival did not change with food availability. The results of
   structural equation modelling indicate that: (1) food availability acts
   directly on body size and gut size, (2) body size directly affects
   developmental rate, and (3) developmental rate acts directly on body
   shape.

   strongly affected by food availability. It also illustrates how
   structural equation modelling can increase our understanding of
   phenotypic integration among several traits that respond to changes in

Abstract = {{Risk assessment and behavioral responses to predation can depend on
   demographic and environmental factors. We studied the escape behavior of
   the sand-diving lizard Meroles anchietae in the Namib Desert, using
   simulated predator approaches and measuring latency to burying in sand.
   Lizards showed a clear preference for burying on a slipface. Flight
   initiation distance was largely influenced by the starting distance
   separating the lizard and pursuer, and whether the animal was initially
   sighted on or off a slipface. In general, longer starting distances were
   associated with longer flight initiation distances. The total flight
   distance covered by lizards before burying was inversely related to body
   size, and positively related to initial distance from a slipface crest.
   Distance from a slipface crest was associated with increased total
   flight distance, most dramatically for those initially sighted on a dune
   slipface. Even when shelter is ubiquitous, sand-dive patterns depend on
   location on a dune and body condition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BackgroundInappropriate dietary eliminations may impair quality of life,
   affect children's growth and unnecessarily impact on healthcare costs.
   Previous retrospective studies reported that around 25\% of children
   continue a food-avoidance diet despite a negative oral food challenge
   (OFC). A definite pattern has not been found yet for patients not
   reintroducing the food. This study aimed to examine the role of child's
   nutritional attitudes and maternal anxiety in reintroducing food after a
   negative OFC.
   MethodsA prospective study was conducted involving 81 mothers of
   children with IgE-mediated food allergy. They completed a survey on
   nutritional behaviour and attitudes and the State-Trait Anxiety
   Inventory on the day of OFC and 6months later.
   ResultsIn total, 11.1\% of children never or rarely ate the food after a
   negative OFC. Consumption of the reintroduced food is positively
   correlated to child's interest in tasting new foods before and after OFC
   and to changes in child's nutritional habits after OFC. It is negatively
   correlated to monotony of the diet after OFC. No correlations were found
   with other participants' characteristics or maternal anxiety. State
   anxiety significantly decreased after the OFC. A correlation was found
   between trait and state anxiety and the degree of change in nutritional
   habits after OFC.
   ConclusionsEvaluating child's approach towards food before the OFC is a
   promising approach to identify patients at risk of food reintroduction
   failure. Furthermore, it underlined the importance of reassessing food
   consumption in all patients after a negative OFC and supporting patients
   in the reintroduction of food.}},

Abstract = {{In animals, nervous systems regulate the ingestion of food and water in

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{While competing males and choosy females may be common in animal mating
   systems, male choice can evolve under certain conditions. Sexual
   cannibalism is such a condition because of the high mortality risk for
   males. In mantids, female body condition is associated with male mate
   preference, with fat females preferred, due to at least two reasons:
   females in poor nutritional condition are likely to attack and predate
   males, and fat females can potentially increase the number of offspring.
   Thus, the risk of cannibalism and female fecundity can influence male
   mating behavior. In this study, we attempted to separate these factors
   by using the praying mantid Tenodera angustipennis to examine whether
   male preference for fat female mantids was based on avoiding sexual
   cannibalism (cannibalism avoidance hypothesis) or preference for female
   fecundity (fecundity preference hypothesis). The feeding regimes were
   experimentally manipulated to discriminate between the effects of female
   fecundity and female hunger status on male and female mating behaviors.
   We found that recently starved females more frequently locomoted toward
   the male, and that male abdominal bending was less intensive and escape
   was sooner from recently starved females. These female and male
   behavioral responses to female hunger condition may reveal male
   avoidance of dangerous females in this mantid.}},

Abstract = {{Predator avoidance depends on prey being able to discern how risk varies
   in space and time, but this is made considerably more complicated if
   risk is simultaneously present from multiple predators. This is the
   situation for an increasing number of mammalian prey species, as large
   carnivores recover or are reintroduced in ecosystems on several
   continents. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus in southern Norway illustrate a
   case in which prey face two predators with contrasting patterns of
   predation risk. They face a catch-22 situation: spatially avoiding the
   risk from one predator (lynx Lynx lynx in dense habitat) implies
   exposure to the other (hunters in open habitat). Using GPS-data from 29
   roe deer, we tested for daily and seasonal variation in roe deer
   selection for habitat with respect to the habitats' year-round average
   risk level. Generally, roe deer altered their habitat selection between
   night and day in a pattern consistent with being able to avoid predicted
   risk from the nocturnal lynx during night and predicted risk from human
   hunters during day. However, seasonal variation in habitat selection
   only partially corresponded with the predicted seasonal variation in
   risk. Whereas roe deer avoided areas with high risk from hunters more
   strongly during the hunting season than in other seasons, there was a
   lack of selection towards areas and time periods lowering the risk of
   lynx predation during winter. It seems likely that the risk of
   starvation and thermal stress constrain roe deer habitat selection
   during this energetically challenging season with cold temperatures,
   snow cover and limited natural forage. The habitat selection pattern of
   roe deer fits thus only partly with the two contrasting risk gradients
   they face. Adjusting risk-avoidance behavior temporally can be an
   adaptive response in the case of several predators whose predation
   patterns differ in space and time.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-47}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Context Long-term viability of wildlife populations may be influenced by
   the adaptive or maladaptive nature of behavioural shifts. Yet, in the
   short term, implications of novel behaviour are often uncertain, as they
   were for a newly formed urban nesting colony of pied imperial-pigeons
   (PIPs) on the mainland coast of north-eastern Australia. It represented
   unprecedented behaviour, as most of PIPs, also known as Torresian
   imperial-pigeons, Ducula bicolor/spilorrhoa, breed colonially on remote
   small islands.
   Aims The present study would (1) determine whether aggregated mainland
   nesting continued, (2) evaluate reproductive success, (3) evaluate
   spatial distribution of nests and (4) explore possible association of
   reproductive success with predator presence and broad indicators of food
   availability.
   Methods With assistance from volunteers, we found mainland PIP nests and
   revisited them intermittently to monitor progress. We calculated
   quantitative estimates of nest survival by the Mayfield method and
   evaluated reproductive output in relation to environmental data from
   independent sources.
   Key results During the 2012, 2013 and 2014 breeding seasons, we recorded
   436, 387 and 417 PIP nest events at the new mainland colony. Daily
   nest-survival rates declined progressively and estimated fledgling
   output decreased over successive seasons from 0.66 to 0.44 per nest
   event. The highest mainland output was below that estimated for an
   island PIP colony (0.78) on the basis of sparse prior data. Across
   potential foraging grounds, there was no negative change in land use and
   no widespread adverse weather to account for diminishing success. We
   identified important causes of nest failure among mainland nesting PIPs
   to be predation, predominantly by birds, and anthropogenic hazards,
   including tree pruning and collisions with vehicles and windows of
   buildings.
   Conclusions With ongoing exposure to these hazards, mainland nesting
   PIPs cannot be expected to increase productivity; hence, the new colony
   may be a short-term phenomenon. We infer that the historic success of
   PIP populations in Queensland stems from their selection of breeding
   sites on remote islands that are largely free of relevant predators and
   anthropogenic activity.
   Implications Future conservation of extant PIP abundance will depend
   crucially on protection of island breeding sites, because multiple
   hazards of mainland nesting make it an unfavourable alternative
   strategy.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{43-51}},

Abstract = {{Alarm calling is a widespread antipredator behaviour, but it is not
   always a reliable indication of real danger. Individuals must decide
   when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and
   benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare.
   We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding
   and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in
   receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild
   dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their
   response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and
   spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond
   to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence
   could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There
   was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals
   from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels
   (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than
   foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived
   as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to
   flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are
   likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring
   more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals
   combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal
   information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to
   terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed
   interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory
   control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue,
   however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing
   an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call,
   potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide
   experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls
   depending on receiver, signaller and external factors. (C) 2017 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{53-66}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Arboreality has evolved in a wide range of taxa, but its adaptive
   significance has rarely been examined in natural ecosystems. Euhadra
   brandtii sapporo is an arboreal land snail distributed in a restricted
   area of Hokkaido, Japan. We hypothesized that arboreality provides the
   species with significant survival advantages, which we tested via field
   observations and experiments. A monitoring census showed that E. b.
   sapporo hibernates in winter in the ground litter, climbs into the
   canopy in early spring and returns to the ground in late autumn. This
   seasonal movement appears to be effective for escaping from predation by
   ground-dwelling carabine beetles, whose activity was high during the
   summer based on a pitfall-trap census. Manipulative field experiments
   were conducted to compare survival rates in arboreal and ground-dwelling
   environments. We collected 120 E. b. sapporo individuals in summer and
   tethered 40 in tree canopies and 80 on the ground; half those on the
   ground were covered by baskets to prevent predation by large animals.
   The survival rate after 11 days was highest in the canopy, followed by
   that on the ground with a basket and was lowest on the ground without a
   basket. Predation was the main cause of death, but some died from other
   causes. Similar results were obtained in autumn, except for higher
   survival rates of the ground treatments. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen
   isotope ratios suggest that the land snail uses epiphytic lichens and
   mosses as food resources. In conclusion, arboreality has a marked
   advantage in reducing mortality in E. b. sapporo and is probably
   supported by food availability as well. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Title = {{Aspects of behavioural genetics in cattle 2nd communication}},
Journal = {{BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A selection for behavioural traits has been practised since man tamed
   the aurochs. Compared with other areas of breeding (evaluation and
   selection with regard to milk yield traits, conformation traits etc.),
   however, only relatively little work is done on behavioural genetics in
   cattle.
   The reason for this is: behavioural traits are often difficult to
   measure accurately and the associated observed values often do not
   follow a normal distribution. In addition, cattle are kept in herds
   which are structured by the owner of the livestock, and thus learning
   from members of the herd regularly has an effect on the genetic
   components.
   The present study aims to provide an overview of more recent findings on
   the behavioural genetics of cattle. The focus is primarily on genetic
   aspects of feeding, reproductive and social behaviour, and on
   temperament. In selected functional cycles, behavioural changes can be
   supported by a further increase in the yield of highly productive cows.
   When all other variables are constant, the increased energy needs and
   nutritional requirements of the high-yield cows lead to the high-yield
   animals taking comparatively longer to feed than lower-yield animals.
   Thus, the high-yield cow has less time to rest. This conflict situation
   is likely to be exacerbated by a further intensive selection for a
   higher milk yield. Thus, the daily amount of time available for
   particular behaviours at a stock level (high-yield dairy cows) could be
   a valuable management tool in the future for detecting the risk of a
   `fatigue syndrome' and thus for assessing the well-being of high-yield
   dairy cows in practice.
   Livestock management systems always represent a compromise between
   different requirements. Animal welfare, and thus the well-being of the
   animals, is becoming increasingly important for the acceptance of
   livestock farming in society. The consumer must recognise that
   animal-friendly livestock management methods cannot be had at ``zero
   cost{''}. The creation of transparency and thus the verifiability of the
   livestock management act as a guide for the consumer.
   The establishment of a consensus between the farmer, the vet and the
   consumer about the livestock management method to be applied
   demonstrably leads to a stabilisation of the market share and the
   standing of the farmers who use animal-friendly livestock management
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of signs that increases the risk to
   develop diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular disease. In the last

   obtaining conflicting results. Diet-induced MS rat models have only

   MS in non-stressed rats chronically submitted to a high-sucrose diet
   (20\% sucrose in drinking water) using three different anxiety
   paradigms: the shock-probe/burying test (SPBT), the elevated plus-maze
   (EPM) and the open-field test (OFT). Behaviorally, the high-sucrose diet
   group showed an increase in burying behavior in the SPBT. Also, these
   animals displayed both avoidance to explore the central part of the
   arena and a significant increase in freezing behavior in the OFT and
   lack of effects in the EPM. Also, high-sucrose diet group showed signs
   of an MS-like condition: significant increases in body weight and body
   mass index, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia,
   hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Plasma leptin and resistin levels
   were also increased. No changes in plasma corticosterone levels were
   found. These results indicate that rats under a 24-weeks high-sucrose

   the mechanisms underlying this behavioral outcome remain to be

Abstract = {{It has often been proposed that bolder, more explorative or more active
   individuals also have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), indicating
   metabolic costs of these personality types. However, such individuals
   might often be restless and thus excluded from RMR datasets, leading to
   a significant sampling bias. We tested (1) whether such a bias occurs
   when animals are measured for a relatively common but short time period
   of 3 h, and if so, (2) whether alternative measures of metabolic rate,
   that allow the incorporation of non-resting individuals, would reveal
   associations between metabolism and personality. For this, we studied
   free-living individuals of the African striped mouse (Rhabdottlys
   pumilio) both during the moist season (N = 25 individuals) with high
   food availability and the dry season (N = 48 individuals) with low food
   availability. We assessed variation in the latency to explore a novel
   object, and the time spent active and time spent in the centre of a
   neutral arena. We examined links between personality and (i) RMR and
   (ii) four alternative metabolic rate (MR) metrics: average MR, highest
   MR, lowest MR and span of MR. Twenty-nine percent of the measured
   individuals had to be excluded from our RMR study because they remained
   restless during respirometry trials. Striped mice showed a behavioural
   syndrome where fast explorers also spent more time in centre and more
   time active than slow explorers. Individuals that did not rest during
   respirometry trials were faster explorers and in the moist season, they
   were also more active and spent more time in the centre than individuals
   that rested. We found no relationship between RMR and the behavioural
   syndrome, which might be due to the exclusion of individuals with a
   certain behavioural type, leaving a subset of compliant individuals. In
   the moist season, we found positive relationships between the
   behavioural syndrome and span of MR and lowest MR. In the dry season,
   low food availability may mask links between the behavioural syndrome
   and alternative MR measures due to reduced overall activity in striped
   mice. Our study demonstrated the importance to consider personality when
   measuring RMR and suggests that some alternative MRs may be useful to
   examine relationships between metabolism and personality when it is
   impossible to measure individuals over extended time periods. (C) 2017

Title = {{Exploring parent-reported barriers to supporting their child's health
   behaviors: a cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Parents can influence the health behaviors of their children
   by engaging in supportive behaviors (e.g., playing outside with their
   child, limiting recreational screen time). How, and the extent to which
   parents engage in supportive behaviors may be influenced by perceived
   barriers. The purpose of this study is to explore whether the frequency,
   and types, of barriers to providing parental support are dependent on
   the type of child health behavior being supported (i.e., physical
   activity, recreational screen time reduction, healthy eating, and
   sleep).
   Methods: Study participants were 1140 Ontario parents with at least one
   child under the age of 18 who completed a Computer Assisted Telephone
   Interview (CATI) survey about parental support behaviors. Open-ended
   responses about perceived barriers to parental support were coded, and
   aggregated to meta-categories adopted from the social-ecological model
   (i.e., individual child, individual parent, interpersonal,
   environmental). Freidman rank sum tests were used to assess differences
   across child behaviors. Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni
   adjustments were used as a post hoc test for significant Freidman
   results.
   Results: There were more barriers reported for supporting physical
   activity than for any other child behavior (ps < .01, As >= .53).
   Parents reported more parent level and environmental level barriers to
   supporting child physical activity versus other behaviors (ps < .001, As
   >= .55), child level barriers were more frequently reported for
   supporting healthy eating and sleep (ps < .001, As >= .57), and
   interpersonal barriers were more frequently reported for supporting
   recreational screen time reduction (ps < .001, As >= .52). Overall,
   parents reported more child and parent level barriers versus
   interpersonal and environmental barriers to supporting child health.
   Conclusions: Parents experience a variety of barriers to supporting
   their children's health behaviors. Differences in types of barriers
   across child health behaviors emerged; however, some frequently reported
   barriers (e.g., child preferences) were common across behaviors.
   Interventions promoting parental support should consider strategies that
   can accommodate parents' busy schedules, and relate to activities that
   children find enjoyable. Creating supportive environments that help
   facilitate support behaviors, while minimizing parent level barriers,
   may be of particular benefit. Future research should explore the impact
   of barriers on parental support behaviors, and effective strategies for
   overcoming common barriers.}},

Abstract = {{Comorbidity challenges the notion of mental disorders as discrete
   categories. An increasing body of literature shows that symptoms cut
   across traditional diagnostic boundaries and interact in shaping the
   latent structure of psychopathology. Using exploratory and confirmatory
   factor analysis, we reveal the latent sources of covariation among nine
   measures of psychopathological functioning in a population-based sample
   of 13024 Finnish twins and their siblings. By implementing
   unidimensional, multidimensional, second-order, and bifactor models, we
   illustrate the relationships between observed variables, specific, and
   general latent factors. We also provide the first investigation to date
   of measurement invariance of the bifactor model of psychopathology
   across gender and age groups. Our main result is the identification of a
   distinct ``Body{''} factor, alongside the previously identified
   Internalizing and Externalizing factors. We also report relevant
   cross-disorder associations, especially between body-related
   psychopathology and trait anger, as well as substantial sex and age
   differences in observed and latent means. The findings expand the
   meta-structure of psychopathology, with implications for empirical and

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Hunger and thirst are fundamental biological processes that drive
   consumption behavior in humans and non-human animals. While the existing
   literature in neuroscience suggests that these satiety states change how
   consumable rewards are represented in the brain, it remains unclear as
   to how they change animal choice behavior and the underlying economic
   preferences. Here, I used combined techniques from experimental
   economics, psychology, and neuroscience to measure food preferences of
   marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus), a recently developed primate
   model for neuroscience. Hunger states of animals were manipulated by
   scheduling feeding intervals, resulting in three different conditions:
   sated, non-sated, and hungry. During these hunger states, animals
   performed pairwise choices of food items, which included all possible
   pairwise combinations of five different food items except for same-food
   pairs. Results showed that hunger enhanced economic rationality, evident
   as a decrease of transitivity violations (item A was preferred to item
   B, and B to C, but C was preferred to A). Further analysis demonstrated
   that hungry monkeys chose more-preferred items over less-preferred items
   in a more deterministic manner, while the individual food preferences
   appeared to remain stable across hunger states. These results suggest
   that hunger enhances consistent choice behavior and shifts animals
   towards efficient outcome maximization.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term studies on rodents have been conducted for longer periods (up
   to 70 years) and more generations (up to 88 generations) than for most
   other mammalian taxa. These studies have been instrumental in furthering
   our understanding of ecophysiology, social systems, and population and
   community processes. Studies on African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)
   revealed that basal blood glucose levels span a far greater homeostatic
   range than previously thought. Studies on American red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) demonstrated how endocrine pathways underlying
   phenotypic plasticity allow individuals to respond to different
   environments. Long-term studies on African striped mice, marmots
   (Marmota), tuco-tucos (Ctenomys sociabilis), and degus (Octodon degus)
   revealed that ecological constraints on dispersal are drivers of group
   formation in some species but not others. Social flexibility, when the
   social system of an entire population can change due to individuals
   changing their social tactics, has been demonstrated in striped mice.
   Long-term studies on prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that
   males and females often live in pairs, leading to subsequent studies of
   the neural mechanisms underlying social monogamy. Long-term studies on
   other arvicoline rodents contributed more to our understanding of the
   factors influencing population dynamics than studies on any other
   mammalian order. While food availability and predation have been
   identified as factors influencing population dynamics, no single factor
   alone drives population dynamics in any species. We encourage
   researchers to incorporate manipulative experiments into long-term

Abstract = {{R{*}{*}esults from animal gambling models have highlighted the
   importance of dopaminergic neurotransmission in modulating decision
   making when large sucrose rewards are combined with uncertainty. The
   majority of these models use food restriction as a tool to motivate
   animals to accomplish operant behavioral tasks, in which sucrose is used
   as a reward. As enhanced motivation to obtain sucrose due to hunger may
   impact its reward-seeking effect, we wanted to examine the
   decision-making behavior of rats in a situation where rats were fed ad
   libitum. For this purpose, we chose alcohol-preferring AA (alko alcohol)
   rats, as these rats have been shown to have high preference for sweet
   agents. In the present study, AA rats were trained to self-administer
   sucrose pellet rewards in a two-lever choice task (one pellet vs. three
   pellets). Once rational choice behavior had been established, the
   probability of gaining three pellets was decreased over time (50\%,
   33\%, 25\% then 20\%). The effect of D-amphetamine on decision making
   was studied at every probability level, as well as the effect of the
   dopamine D-1 receptor agonist SKF-81297 and D-2 agonist quinpirole at
   probability levels of 100\% and 25\%. D-Amphetamine increased
   unprofitable choices in a dose-dependent manner at the two lowest
   probability levels. Quinpirole increased the frequency of unprofitable
   decisions at the 25\% probability level, and SKF-82197 did not affect
   choice behavior. These results mirror the findings of probabilistic
   discounting studies using food-restricted rats. Based on this, the use
   of AA rats provides a new approach for studies on reward-guided decision
   making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Clustering and correlates of screen-time and eating behaviours among
   young adolescents}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Screen-time and eating behaviours are associated in
   adolescents, but few studies have examined the clustering of these
   health behaviours in this age group. The identification of clustered
   health behaviours, and influences on adolescents' clustered health
   behaviours, at the time when they are most likely to become habitual, is
   important for intervention design. The purpose of this study was to
   assess the prevalence and clustering of health behaviours in
   adolescents, and examine the sociodemographic, individual, behavioural,
   and home social and physical environmental correlates of clustered
   health behaviours.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 11-12 years (n = 527, 48\% boys) completed a
   questionnaire during class-time which assessed screen-time (ST), fruit
   and vegetable (FV), and energy-dense (ED) snack consumption using a Food
   Frequency Questionnaire. Health behaviours were categorised into high
   and low frequencies based on recommendations for FV and ST and median
   splits for ED snacks. Adolescents reported on their habits,
   self-efficacy, eating at the television (TV), eating and watching TV
   together with parents, restrictive parenting practices, and the
   availability and accessibility of foods within the home. Behavioural
   clustering was assessed using an observed over expected ratio (O/E).
   Correlates of clustered behaviours were examined using multivariate
   multinomial logistic regression.
   Results: Approximately 70\% reported having two or three health risk
   behaviours. Overall, O/E ratios were close to 1, which indicates
   clustering. The three risk behaviour combination of low FV, high ED, and
   high ST occurred more frequently than expected (O/E ratio = 1.06 95\% CI
   1.01, 1.15. Individual, behavioural, and social and physical home
   environmental correlates were differentially associated with behavioural
   clusters. Correlates consistently associated with clusters included
   eating ED snacks while watching TV, eating at the TV with parents, and
   the availability and accessibility of ED snack foods within the home.
   Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of screen time and unhealthy
   eating, and screen time is coupled with unhealthy dietary behaviours.
   Strategies and policies are required that simultaneously address
   reductions in screen time and changes to habitual dietary patterns, such
   as TV snacking and snack availability and accessibility. These may
   require a combination of individual, social and environmental changes
   alongside conscious and more automatic (nudging) strategies.}},

Abstract = {{1. Human-induced rapid environmental change may decrease food resources
   and create unfavourable conditions for native species. Organisms showing
   a flexible foraging behaviour can exploit novel or alternative foods and
   are more likely to persist, whereas less flexible organisms might suffer
   starvation and numerical reductions. 2. This study assessed whether
   declines in the quality and availability of seeds prompted by grazing
   provoke behavioural and numerical responses in Pogonomyrmex mendozanus
   ants, and aimed to test whether behavioural flexibility buffers habitat
   degradation and prevents numerical declines. 3. Heavy grazing caused
   seed reductions, especially of the highly consumed and preferred grass
   seeds, and triggered two kinds of ant responses. Ants expanded their
   diet by incorporating a greater proportion of non-seed items, and they
   reduced foraging activity. As a consequence, the rate of food intake per
   colony lessened, particularly that of carbohydrate-rich seeds like grass
   seeds. Colony density under heavy grazing also fell. 4. Habitat
   degradation triggered a cascade of mechanisms that starts with a
   decrease in the seed resources and continues with changes in ant
   behaviour. However, behavioural responses were insufficient to prevent
   ant numerical declines. The results of this study suggest that the
   reduction in the colony density under habitat degradation was provoked
   by ant nutritional deficit and starvation, and predict a deterioration
   in body condition, colony performance and reproduction of ants, which
   deserve further assessment.}},

Abstract = {{1. The food plant quality influences feeding preferences and various
   life history traits of herbivorous insects. However, the effects of
   different host plant qualities on the behavioural phenotype have rarely
   been studied in behavioural ecology, especially in a
   pest-crop-framework. 2. Behavioural phenotypes of insects may not only
   be affected by external environmental factors, such as the host plant
   quality but are also shaped by internal factors, such as the sex and the
   age of individuals. 3. To study host plant effects on behavioural
   phenotypes, we reared mustard leaf beetles (Phaedon
   cochleariaeFabricius) either on their natural host watercress or on the
   crop cabbage, on which this beetle can be a pest. The behavioural
   phenotype was characterised twice in the adult lifetime by measuring six
   behavioural traits tested in distinct contexts. 4. Depending on the
   context, different behavioural traits were specifically affected by the
   host plant, the sex and/or the age. Beetles fed on cabbage became more
   active with age. Furthermore, the boldness tested in an unprotected
   environment context was influenced by the host, with beetles fed on
   cabbage being bolder, whereas the boldness in a hiding or predator
   attack context was affected by the age and/or the interaction of host
   plant x sex. 5. In conclusion, beetles fed on the crop cabbage develop a
   different behavioural phenotype compared to beetles fed on watercress.
   Previous results showed that beetles reared on cabbage have a higher
   reproductive output. Thus, beetles fed on the crop potentially express a
   faster pace-of-life.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-239}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Predation is a significant cause of nest failure in passerine birds,
   and, thus, natural selection is expected to favor behavioral plasticity
   to allow birds to respond to perceived changes in predation risk.
   However, behavioral plasticity in response to perceived predation risk,
   and its potential fitness-related costs, are understudied. In a wild
   population of breeding house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), we tested the
   hypotheses that (1) birds show behavioral plasticity in response to
   perceived nest-predation risk to reduce self-risk or risk to offspring,
   but (2) this plasticity incurs fitness-related costs. We experimentally
   increased the perceived risk of nest predation by enlarging the diameter
   of the nestbox entrance from the standard 3.2 to 5.0 cm once incubation
   began. Unexpectedly, large-hole females spent significantly less time
   being vigilant than small-hole (control) females during late incubation.
   Both males and females also exhibited plasticity in their provisioning
   behavior. Large-hole males increased and large-hole females decreased
   provisioning visits with increasing brood size, whereas small-hole males
   and females behaved similarly and were unaffected by brood size. Females
   did not show plasticity in their incubation or brooding behavior.
   Notwithstanding this behavioral plasticity in response to increased
   perceived predation risk, treatment had no effect on hatching success or
   early hatchling survival, nor did it affect nestling body condition or
   fledging success. We conclude, therefore, that house wrens show
   behavioral plasticity in response to perceived nest-predation risk, but
   that any short-term fitness-related costs associated with this
   flexibility appear negligible.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1660-1670}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although it has been frequently suggested that resource partitioning of
   species coexisting at the same trophic level can be mediated by
   interactions with species at non-adjacent trophic levels, empirical
   evidence supporting this claim is scarce. Here we demonstrate that
   plants may mediate resource partitioning for two parasitoids that share
   the same herbivorous host. The tephritid fly Tephritis femoralis is the
   primary pre-dispersal seed predator of two Asteraceae species, Saussurea
   nigrescens and Anaphalis flavescens, both of which dominate the plant
   community in the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau. Field surveys
   and molecular barcoding analyses showed that the identity of the fly's
   main predator depended on the plant in which the fly developed.
   Tephritid flies that developed in S. nigrescens were preyed upon mainly
   by the parasitoid wasp Pteromalus albipennis, while the parasitoid
   Mesopolobus sp. was the main predator of flies that developed in A.
   flavescens. Microcosm experiments revealed that P. albipennis could not
   exploit the host flies within the capitula of A. flavescens due to food
   limitation (capitula are too small), while Mesopolobus sp. could not
   exploit the host flies within the capitula of S. nigrescens due to its
   inability to reach the host with its ovipositor (capitula are too
   large). Such bottom-up control of plant species traits may facilitate
   the coexistence of parasitoid wasps sharing a common host in this
   system. We suggest that interactions between non-adjacent trophic levels
   may potentially promote species coexistence and diversity in biological
   communities.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{863-873}},

Abstract = {{Food availability and predation risk can have drastic impacts on animal
   behaviour and populations. The tradeoff between foraging and predator
   avoidance is crucial for animal survival and will strongly affect
   individual body mass, since large fat reserves are beneficial to reduce
   starvation but may increase predation risk. However, two-factor
   experiments simultaneously investigating the interactive effects of food
   and predation risk, are still rare. We studied the effects of food
   supplementation and natural predation risk imposed by pygmy owls
   Glaucidium passerinum on the abundance and fat reserves of tit species
   in boreal forests of north Europe, from January to March in 2012 and in
   2013. Food supplementation increased the number of individuals present
   in a given forest patch, whereas the level of predation risk had no
   clear impact on the abundance of tit species. The stronger impact of
   food supply respect to predation risk could be the consequence of the
   harsh winter conditions in north Europe, with constant below-zero
   temperatures and only few (5-7 h) daylight hours available for foraging.
   Predation risk did not have obvious effects on tit abundance but
   influenced food consumption and, together with food supplementation,
   affected the deposition of subcutaneous fat in great tits Parus major.
   High owl predation risk had detrimental effects on body fat reserves,
   which may reduce over-winter survival, but the costs imposed by pygmy
   owl risk were compensated when food was supplemented. The
   starvation-predation tradeoff faced by great tits in winter may thus be
   mediated through variation in body fat reserves. In small species living
   in harsh environment, this tradeoff appeared thus to be biased towards
   avoidance of starvation, at the cost of increasing predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Unhealthy behaviors, including smoking, poor nutrition, excessive

   global risk factors for non-communicable diseases and premature death.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique approach to
   optimize health messages by examining how the brain responds to
   information relating to health. Our aim was to systematically review
   fMRI studies that have investigated variations in brain activation in
   response to health messages relating to (i) smoking; (ii) alcohol
   consumption; (iii) physical activity; (iv) diet; and (v) sedentary
   behavior. The electronic databases used were Medline/PubMed, Web of
   Science (Core Collection), PsychINFO, SPORTDiscuss, Cochrane Library and
   Open Grey. Studies were included if they investigated subjects aged >=
   10 years and were published before January 2017. Of the 13,836 studies
   identified in the database search, 18 studies (smoking k = 15; diet k =
   2; physical activity/sedentary behavior k = 1) were included in the
   review. The prefrontal cortex was activated in seven (47\%) of the
   smoking-related studies and the physical activity study. Results suggest
   that activation of the ventromedial, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal
   cortex regions were predictive of subsequent behavior change following
   exposure to aversive anti-smoking stimuli. Studies investigating the
   neurological responses to anti-smoking material were most abundant. Of
   note, the prefrontal cortex and amygdala were most commonly activated in
   response to health messages across lifestyle behaviors. The review
   highlights an important disparity between research focusing on different
   lifestyle behaviors. Insights from smoking literature suggest fMRI may
   help to optimize health messaging in relation to other lifestyle
   behaviors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   coexists with a larger species, C. (O.) dehaanii. At low altitudes, C.
   japonicus shows larger body sizes. We sought to determine whether this
   increase in body size is only an adaptation to high habitat temperatures
   in the absence of C. dehaanii, and examined the life history of C.
   japonicus and seasonal trends in prey earthworms at six sites between
   altitudes of 30 and 980 m. While high-altitude populations used the
   entire warm season for reproduction and larval development, low-altitude
   populations showed shorter periods of reproductive activity and larval
   incidence coincided with seasonal trends in earthworm abundance. Thus,
   C. japonicus attained larger body sizes at lower altitudes without a
   notable extension of their juvenile period. At lower altitudes,
   earthworms grew faster and reached sizes, which may be too large for
   predation by small carabid larvae. Large females had higher fecundity,
   and laid larger eggs, from which larger first instar larvae hatch. The
   large body size of C. japonicus in warm habitats may thus be an
   adaptation not only for high fecundity, but also for producing large
   first instar larvae to more efficiently prey on large earthworms.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental question in life-history evolution is how organisms cope
   with fluctuating environments, including variation between stressful and
   benign conditions. For short-lived organisms, environments commonly vary
   between generations. Using a novel experimental design, we exposed
   wild-derived Drosophila melanogaster to three different selection
   regimes: one where generations alternated between starvation and benign
   conditions, and starvation was always preceded by early exposure to
   cold; another where starvation and benign conditions alternated in the
   same way, but cold shock sometimes preceded starvation and sometimes
   benign conditions; and a third where conditions were always benign.
   Using six replicate populations per selection regime, we found that
   selected flies increased their starvation resistance, most strongly for
   the regime where cold and starvation were reliably combined, and this
   occurred without decreased fecundity or extended developmental time. The
   selected flies became stress resistant, displayed a pronounced increase
   in early life food intake and resource storage. In contrast to previous
   experiments selecting for increased starvation resistance in D.
   melanogaster, we did not find increased storage of lipids as the main
   response, but instead that, in particular for females, storage of
   carbohydrates was more pronounced. We argue that faster mobilization of
   carbohydrates is advantageous in fluctuating environments and conclude
   that the phenotype that evolved in our experiment corresponds to a
   compromise between the requirements of stressful and benign
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is a key feature of many organisms and
   individuals can benefit from early programming to optimize their
   phenotypes for the expected environmental conditions. However,
   environmental conditions may sometimes change unexpectedly. Mismatches
   between early and adult life, for example, can have important
   repercussions for adult phenotypes, potentially leading to better
   performance under matched than mismatched conditions as predicted by the
   predictive adaptive response hypothesis. We conducted a long-term
   experimental manipulation of dietary conditions in a population of zebra
   finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Broods were exposed to two early
   nutritional treatments until independence and we used a split-brood
   design to independently manipulate nutritional conditions after
   independence to create matched and mismatched nutritional environments
   in later life. Developmental trajectories of all individuals were
   followed for more than 5 years and we scored behavioural responses in
   trials in a special environment and while interacting with a special
   object three times during adult life. Overall, we found no evidence for
   early programming affecting morphology. Tarsus and wing length were
   exclusively influenced by the early nutrition. Body weight showed
   lasting effects of the early treatment and independent effects of
   nutritional condition during adulthood, but no effects of environmental
   matching or mismatching. Special-object trials showed effects of the
   adult nutritional treatment while environmental matching affected
   hopping activity in special environments. These behavioural responses
   showed substantial long-term individual stability over a 3-month period
   and were only marginally smaller when measured over a period of more
   than 4 years. Interestingly, survival of individuals from low-quality
   early nutritional condition was higher compared with highquality early
   condition individuals, which became evident only after years of survival
   monitoring. Beyond the nutritional treatment itself, we found sizable
   brood identity effects that slowly but steadily declined with age,
   indicating a significant but decaying effect of natural variation in

Title = {{Alternative foraging strategies enable a mountain ungulate to persist
   after migration loss}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The persistence of many migratory ungulate populations worldwide is
   threatened due to anthropogenic impacts to seasonal ranges and migration
   routes. While many studies have linked migratory ungulate declines to
   migration disruption or loss, very few have explored the underlying
   factors that determine whether a population perishes or persists. In
   some cases, populations undergo severe declines and extirpation after
   migration loss; however, others appear able to persist as residents. We
   predict that to persist, populations must replace the traditional
   benefits of migration by altering the foraging strategies they employ as
   residents within one seasonal range. We propose the alternative foraging
   strategies (AFS) hypothesis as a framework for identifying various
   behavioral strategies that populations may use to cope with migration
   loss. We tested the hypothesis using the formerly migratory Teton
   bighorn sheep population in northwest Wyoming, which ceased migrating
   over 60 yr ago, but has persisted as a resident population. We used
   global positioning system data to evaluate winter and summer habitat
   selection and seasonal elevational movements for 28 adult female bighorn
   sheep (Ovis canadensis) from 2008 to 2010. Resource selection functions
   revealed that bighorn sheep employ winter foraging strategies to survive
   as residents by seeking out rugged, high-elevation, windswept
   ridgelines. Seasonal movement analyses indicated that bighorn sheep
   undergo a newly documented ``abbreviated migration{''} strategy that is
   closely synchronized with vegetation green-up patterns within their one
   range. Bighorn sheep descend 500 m in elevation and travel up to 10 km
   in spring, gaining access to newly emergent forage approximately 30 d
   before it appears on their high-elevation winter and summer ranges. Our
   findings indicate that the Teton bighorn sheep population has persisted
   due to its habitat selection, AFS, and unique movement patterns, which
   allow migration loss to be mediated to some extent. The identification
   of AFS and the habitats that support them can help reveal the underlying
   benefits of migration and conserve populations in the face of future
   migration loss.}},

Title = {{Age- and environment-dependent changes in chemical defences of larval
   and post-metamorphic toads}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chemical defences are widespread in animals, but how their
   production is adjusted to ecological conditions is poorly known. Optimal
   defence theory predicts that inducible defences are favoured over
   constitutive defences when toxin production is costly and the need for
   it varies across environments. However, if some environmental changes
   occur predictably (e.g. coupled to transitions during ontogeny), whereas
   others are unpredictable (e.g. predation, food availability), changes in
   defences may have constitutive as well as plastic elements. To
   investigate this phenomenon, we raised common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles
   with ad libitum or limited food and in the presence or absence of
   chemical cues on predation risk, and measured their toxin content on 5
   occasions during early ontogeny.
   Results: The number of compounds showed limited variation with age in
   tadpoles and was unaffected by food limitation and predator cues. The
   total amount of bufadienolides first increased and later decreased
   during development, and it was elevated in young and mid-aged tadpoles
   with limited food availability compared to their ad libitum fed
   conspecifics, whereas it did not change in response to cues on predation
   risk. We provide the first evidence for the active synthesis of
   defensive toxin compounds this early during ontogeny in amphibians.
   Furthermore, the observation of increased quantities of bufadienolides
   in food-restricted tadpoles is the first experimental demonstration of
   resource-dependent induction of elevated de novo toxin production,
   suggesting a role for bufadienolides in allelopathy.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity
   in chemical defences may depend on the ecological context (i.e.
   predation vs. competition). Our results furthermore suggest that the
   age-dependent changes in the diversity of toxin compounds in developing
   toads may be fixed (i.e., constitutive), timed for the developmental
   stages in which they are most reliant on their chemical arsenal, whereas
   inducible plasticity may prevail in the amount of synthesized compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Sirtuins are pleiotropic NAD(+) dependent histone deacetylases involved

   SIRT6, a member of the sirtuin family, regulates the process of normal

   15\%. Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons within the hippocampus
   of adult mammals, involves several complex stages including stem cell
   proliferation, differentiation, migration and network integration.
   During aging, the number of newly generated neurons continuously
   declines, and this is correlated with a decline in neuronal plasticity
   and cognitive behavior. In this study we investigated the involvement of
   SIRT6 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice over-expressing Sirt6
   exhibit increased numbers of young neurons and decreased numbers of
   mature neurons, without affecting glial differentiation. This implies of
   an involvement of SIRT6 in neuronal differentiation and maturation

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Food choice is influenced by many interacting factors in humans. Its
   multidimensional and complex nature is well recognized, particularly
   within the sensory and consumer food science field. However, the vast
   majority of the studies aimed at understanding determinants of food
   choices, preferences, and eating behaviours are affected by important
   limitations: the limited number of factors that are considered at once
   and the sample size. Furthermore, sensory and hedonic responses to
   actual food stimuli are often not included in such studies.
   The Italian Taste project is a large-scale study (three thousand
   respondents in three years) launched by the Italian Sensory Science
   Society aimed at addressing these limitations by exploring the
   associations among a variety of measures biological, genetic,
   physiological, psychological and personality-related, socio-cultural
   describing the dimensions of food liking, preference, behaviour and
   choice, and their relevance in determining individual differences within
   a given food culture framework. In addition, the study includes also the
   collection of sensory and hedonic responses to actual food stimuli
   commonly consumed in Italy and prepared to elicit a variation in the
   strength (from weak to strong) of bitterness, sweetness, saltiness,
   sourness, pungency, umami and astringency.
   The aims of the present paper are twofold. Firstly, the paper is aimed
   to illustrate the variables selected to explore the different dimensions
   of food choice and to report the experimental procedure adopted for data
   collection. Secondly, the paper is aimed at showing the potential of the
   Italian Taste dataset on the basis of the data collected in the first
   year of the project. For the purpose, we selected a small number of
   variables known to influence food choices from data collected in the
   first year of the project on 1225 individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nutritional conditions in early life can have a lasting impact on health
   and disease risk, though the underlying mechanisms are incompletely
   understood. In the healthy individual, physiological and behavioral
   responses to stress are coordinated in such a way as to mobilize
   resources necessary to respond to the stressor and to terminate the
   stress response at the appropriate time. Induction of proinflammatory
   gene expression within the brain is one such example that is initiated
   in response to both physiological and psychological stressors, and is
   the focus of the current study. We tested the hypothesis that early life
   nutrition would impact the proinflammatory transcriptional response to a
   stressor. Pregnant and lactating dams were fed one of three diets; a
   low-protein diet, a high fat diet, or the control diet through pregnancy
   and lactation. Adult male offspring were then challenged with either a
   physiological stressor (acute lipopolysaccharide injection, IP) or a
   psychological stressor (15 min restraint). Expression of 20
   proinflammatory and stress-related genes was evaluated in hypothalamus,
   prefrontal cortex, amygdala and ventral tegmental area. In a second
   cohort, behavioral responses (food intake, locomotor activity, metabolic
   rate) were evaluated. Offspring from low protein fed dams showed a
   generally reduced transcriptional response, particularly to LPS, and
   resistance to behavioral changes associated with restraint, while HF
   offspring showed an exacerbated transcriptional response within the PFC,
   a reduced transcriptional response in hypothalamus and amygdala, and an
   exacerbation of the LPS-induced reduction of locomotor activity. The
   present data identify differential proinflammatory transcriptional
   responses throughout the brain driven by perinatal diet as an important
   variable that may affect risk or resilience to stressors. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Energetic status and body size are inconstant bodily states often
   considered to have feedback effects on behaviour. Feedbacks can be
   negative, like starvation-threshold feedbacks (lower state
   values=increased risk taking due to higher energy need, and vice versa),
   or positive, like state-dependent safety feedbacks (higher state
   values=lower vulnerability when expressing risky behaviours, and vice
   versa). Few studies have investigated feedback effects during the
   early-life survival bottleneck of territorial species, when rapid growth
   is particularly important to maintain competitive ability. We
   investigated effects of body size and energetic status on the emergence
   latency into an unknown environment in highly territorial brown trout
   fry. We manipulated energetic status using high and low food rations in
   different combinations over two consecutive periods. In contrast to
   results from other small-sized fishes, no general behavioural effects of
   energetic state were detected, but larger fish had on average shorter
   emergence latency. Starvation-threshold feedbacks were not supported,
   but the size effect favours the presence of a state-dependent safety
   feedback. When individuals were split into clusters characterised by
   long (>34s) and short (<34s) emergence latency, a state-dependent safety
   feedback, based on energetic status, was found in the short-latency
   cluster. Positive state-dependent feedbacks may reflect the high level
   of competition among wild trout fry during the first summer,
   particularly among the more active individuals (i.e., from the short
   latency cluster). High state levels could be utilised to gain advantages
   over lesser competitors (e.g., to establish territories), particularly
   if the overall risk of starvation is higher than the risk of predation.}},

Abstract = {{A major issue in the addiction field is the limited number of animal
   models of the voluntary induction and maintenance of alcohol dependence
   in outbred rats.
   To address this issue, we developed a novel apparatus that vaporizes
   alcohol for 2-10 min after an active nosepoke response.
   Male Wistar rats were allowed to self-administer alcohol vapor for 8
   h/day every other day for 24 sessions (escalated) or eight sessions
   (non-escalated). Escalated and non-escalated rats were then tested for
   progressive ratio responding. Anxiety-like behavior, somatic signs of
   withdrawal, and hyperalgesia were assessed during acute withdrawal.
   The results showed that rats exhibited excellent discrimination between
   the active and inactive operanda (> 85\%), and the escalated rats
   quickly increased their blood alcohol levels from similar to 50 to > 200
   mg\% in similar to 6 weeks. Compared with non-escalated rats, escalated
   rats exhibited severe addiction-like behavior, including somatic signs
   of withdrawal, anxiety-like behavior, hyperalgesia, and higher
   responding on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement.
   These results demonstrate that outbred rats will voluntarily
   self-administer alcohol vapor to the point of dependence without the use
   of forced alcohol administration, sweeteners, food/water restriction,
   operant pretraining, or behavioral/genetic selection. This novel animal
   model may be particularly useful for medication development to help
   unveil the neuronal circuitry that underlies the voluntary induction of
   alcohol addiction and identify novel molecular targets that are
   specifically recruited after the voluntary induction and maintenance of
   alcohol dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We evaluated risk-sensitive foraging in adult male western
   chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) occupying a savanna environment at
   Fongoli, Senegal. The aim of this study was to determine how the risks
   of predation and heat stress influenced their behavior while feeding on
   a key food, fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata).
   Materials and Methods: Proximity of fruiting baobab trees to
   anthropogenic landmarks were compared to food intake, feeding rate, and
   behavioral indicators of fear in adult males (N = 11) at Fongoli.
   Additionally, we compared foraging to vegetative habitats, baobab ripe
   fruit nutritive quality, surface water availability, and foraging party
   composition.
   Results: Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic
   landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator
   behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk
   did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead,
   risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer
   feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in
   open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of
   heat stress.
   Conclusions: Adaptations that minimize predation risk are widespread in
   mammalian prey species, but these traits are poorly understood in
   chimpanzees. Great apes encounter few nonhuman predators capable of
   successfully capturing and killing them; thus, such events are rarely
   observed. Although people rarely hunt chimpanzees in Senegal, we found
   that adult males perceived humans as predators and adjusted their
   behavior while foraging in risky habitats. From an applied perspective,
   risk-taking behavior is important for understanding and mitigating the
   problem of crop-feeding in locations where chimpanzees and humans live
   in sympatry.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated brain reward and attention region response, and weaker
   inhibitory region response to high calorie food images have been found
   to predict future weight gain. These findings suggest that an
   intervention that reduces reward and attention region response and
   increases inhibitory control region response to such foods might reduce
   overeating. We conducted a randomized pilot experiment that tested the
   hypothesis that a multi-faceted food response and attention training
   with personalized high and low-calorie food images would produce changes
   in behavioral and neural responses to food images and body fat compared
   to a control training with non-food images among community-recruited
   over-weight/obese adults. Compared to changes observed in controls,
   completing the intervention was associated with significant reductions
   in reward and attention region response to high-calorie food images
   (Mean Cohen's d = 1.54), behavioral evidence of learning, reductions in
   palatability ratings and monetary valuation of high-calorie foods (p =
   0.009, d's = 0.92), and greater body fat loss over a 4-week period (p =
   0.009, d = 0.90), though body fat effects were not significant by
   6-month follow-up. Results suggest that this multifaceted response and
   attention training intervention was associated with reduced reward and
   attention region responsivity to food cues, and a reduction in body fat.
   Because this implicit training treatment is both easy and inexpensive to
   deliver, and does not require top-down executive control that is
   necessary for negative energy balance obesity treatment, it may prove
   useful in treating obesity if future studies can determine how to create
   more enduring effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The physiological consequences of severe energy deficit
   include hypogonadism and the loss of fat free mass. Prolonged energy
   deficit also impacts physical performance, mood, attentiveness, and
   decision making capabilities. This study will determine whether
   maintaining a eugonadal state during severe, sustained energy deficit
   attenuates physiological decrements and maintains mental performance.
   This study will also assess the effects of normalizing testosterone
   levels during severe energy deficit and recovery on gut health and
   appetite regulation.
   Methods: Fifty physically active men will participate acclimation phase
   (protein: 1.6 g.kg(-1).d(-1); fat: 30\% total energy intake),
   participants will be randomized to undergo a 28-d, 55\% energy deficit
   phase with (DEF + TEST: 200 mg testosterone enanthate per week) or
   without (DEF) exogenous testosterone. Diet and physical activity will be
   rigorously controlled. Recovery from the energy deficit (ad libitum
   diet, no testosterone) will be assessed until body mass has been
   recovered within +/- 2.5\% of initial body mass. Body composition,
   stable isotope methodologies, proteomics, muscle biopsies, whole-room
   calorimetry, molecular biology, activity/sleep monitoring, personality
   and cognitive function assessments, functional MRI, and comprehensive
   biochemistries will be used to assess physiological and psychological
   responses to energy restriction and recovery feeding while volunteers
   are in an expected hypogonadal versus eugonadal state.
   Discussion: The Optimizing Performance for Soldiers (OPS) study aims to
   determine whether preventing hypogonadism will mitigate declines in
   physical and mental function that typically occur during prolonged
   energy deficit, and the efficacy of testosterone replacement on recovery

Abstract = {{Overconsumption of high-fat diets (HFDs) can critically affect synaptic
   and cognitive functions within telencephalic structures such as the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The underlying mechanisms, however,
   remain largely unknown. Here we show that adolescence is a sensitive
   period for the emergence of prefrontal cognitive deficits in response to
   HFD. We establish that the synaptic modulator reelin (RELN) is a
   critical mediator of this vulnerability because (1) periadolescent HFD
   (pHFD) selectively downregulates prefrontal RELN+ cells and (2)
   augmenting mPFC RELN levels using transgenesis or prefrontal
   pharmacology prevents the pHFD-induced prefrontal cognitive deficits. We
   further identify N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent long-term depression
   (NMDA-LTD) at prefrontal excitatory synapses as a synaptic signature of
   this association because pHFD abolishes NMDA-LTD, a function that is
   restored by RELN overexpression. We believe this study provides the
   first mechanistic insight into the vulnerability of the adolescent mPFC
   towards nutritional stress, such as HFDs. Our findings have primary
   relevance to obese individuals who are at an increased risk of
   developing neurological cognitive comorbidities, and may extend to
   multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in which RELN
   deficiency is a common feature.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of alternative phenotypes, different morphologies produced
   by a single genome, has contributed novel insights into development and
   evolution. Yet, the mechanisms underlying developmental switch points
   between alternative phenotypes remain poorly understood. The calyptraeid
   snails Crepidula navicella and Calyptraea lichen produce two phenotypes:
   viable and nutritive embryos, where nutritive embryos arrest their
   development after gastrulation and are ingested by their viable siblings
   as a form of intracapsular nutrition. Here, we investigate the activity
   of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, ERK1/2) and apoptosis during
   early cleavage. MAPK and apoptosis, found in a previous transcriptomic
   study, are known to be involved in organization of other spiralian
   embryos and nutritive embryo development, respectively. In the model
   Crepidula fornicata, MAPK activation begins at the 16-cell stage. In
   contrast, we discovered in C.navicella and C. lichen that many embryos
   begin MAPK activation at the one-cell stage. A subset of embryos shows a
   similar pattern of MAPK activation to C. fornicata at later stages. In
   all stages where MAPK is detected, the activation pattern is highly
   variable, frequently occurring in all quadrants or in multiple tiers of
   cells. We also detected apoptosis in cleaving embryos, while C.
   fornicata and Crepidula lessoni, which do not produce nutritive embryos,
   show no signs of apoptosis during cleavage. Our results show that MAPK
   and apoptosis are expressed during early development in species with
   nutritive embryos, and raises the possibility that these processes may
   play a role and even interact with one another in producing the
   nutritive embryo phenotype. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary specialization has been described across a wide range of taxa in
   the animal kingdom. Fitness consequences are, however, not well
   documented. We examined the reproductive consequences of different
   dietary specializations in the herring gull Larus argentatus, an
   omnivorous seabird, using an extensive dataset which includes breeding
   and dietary data of 10 successive years. We hypothesized that pairs that
   focused on prey of higher energetic value would yield higher fledging
   rates. An alternative hypothesis is that pairs that relied on more
   resources simultaneously would reproduce better. The novelty of this
   study is that we used continuous measurements representing dietary
   composition and degree of specialization rather than restricting our
   analysis to predefined categories. By relating these two continuous
   measurements for diet to several proxies for reproductive success, we
   show clear consequences of dietary choice. Most pairs concentrated on
   bivalves, a prey type not particularly rich in energy. Pairs feeding on
   energy-rich prey (e.g., ``domestic refuse and fishery discards{''})
   during chick rearing were found to have a higher reproductive success,
   supporting the first hypothesis. Pairs that used more resources did not
   clearly have a higher reproductive success. The majority of the pairs
   did not switch to energy-rich prey during chick rearing, despite low
   breeding outcome. We discuss how trade-offs between factors such as
   resource availability, predictability, and the time and energy needed to
   obtain certain prey species may influence resource selection.}},

Abstract = {{Increased perceived predation risk can cause behavioral and
   physiological responses to reduce direct predation mortality, but these
   responses can also cause demographic costs through reduced reproductive
   output. Such indirect costs of predation risk have received increased
   attention in recent years, but the relative importance of direct vs.
   indirect predation costs to population growth (k) across species remains
   unclear. We measured direct nest predation rates as well as indirect
   benefits (i.e., reduced predation rates) and costs (i.e., decreased
   reproductive output) arising from parental responses to perceived
   offspring predation risk for 10 songbird species breeding along natural
   gradients in nest predation risk. We show that reductions in seasonal
   fecundity from behavioral responses to perceived predation risk
   represent significant demographic costs for six of the 10 species.
   However, demographic costs from these indirect predation effects on
   seasonal fecundity comprised only 12\% of cumulative predation costs
   averaged across species. In contrast, costs from direct predation
   mortality comprised 88\% of cumulative predation costs averaged across
   species. Demographic costs from direct offspring predation were
   relatively more important for species with higher within-season
   residual-reproductive value (i.e., multiple-brooded species) than for
   species with lower residual-reproductive value (i.e., single-brooded
   species). Costs from indirect predation effects were significant across
   single-but not multiple-brooded species. Ultimately, demographic costs
   from behavioral responses to offspring predation risk differed among
   species as a function of their life-history strategies. Yet direct
   predation mortality generally wielded a stronger influence than indirect
   effects on seasonal fecundity and projected lambda across species.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{1. Escaping from a predator is a matter of life or death, and prey are
   expected to adaptively alter their physiology under chronic predation
   risk in ways that may affect escape. Theoretical models assume that
   escape performance is mass dependent, whereby scared prey strategically
   maintain an optimal body mass to enhance escape. Experiments testing the
   mass-dependent predation risk hypothesis have demonstrated that prior
   experience of predation risk can affect body mass, and the behavioural
   decisions about evasive actions to take. Other studies on natural
   changes in body mass indicate that mass can affect escape. No single
   experiment has tested if all of these components are indeed linked,
   which is a critical necessary condition underpinning the mass-dependent
   predation risk hypothesis.
   2. We tested all components of the mass-dependent predation risk
   hypothesis in a repeated measures experiment by presenting predator and
   non-predator cues to brown-headed cowbirds housed in semi-natural
   conditions. Exposure to predator cues affected body mass, fat, pectoral
   muscle thickness and evasive actions (take-off angle and speed), but not
   the physiological capacity to escape, as measured by flying ability.
   Examining individual variation revealed that flying ability was
   unrelated to mass loss in either sex, unrelated to mass gain in males,
   and only females that gained a very large amount of mass flew poorly.
   3. We next conducted a body mass manipulation in the laboratory to
   rigorously test whether small to large perturbations in mass can ever
   affect flying ability. We induced either no change in mass (control), a
   moderate reduction of <10\% or a more extreme reduction of >10\% which
   the literature suggests should enhance flight. Flying ability was
   maintained regardless of treatment. Examining individual variation
   revealed the same precise patterns as in the first experiment.
   4. We conclude that prey may alter their mass and evasive actions in
   response to predation risk, but their escape ability remains robust and
   inelastic, presumably because disabling oneself is likely to lead to
   disastrous consequences. We suggest that animals may only face a
   mass-dependent predation risk trade-off in a narrow set of circumstances
   linked to life-history stages that require large amounts of mass gain,
   for example, parturition and migration.}},

   momentary impact of personality traits on precipitants of binge-purge
   episodes, brain system function responses to environmental stressors,
   and cross-generational transmission of risk. The importance of further

   found that behavioural data (flight responses and time budgets) often
   indicated positive effects of such activities; time budget data are
   often ambiguous, while physiological data tended to show negative
   responses. Therefore, how researchers measure the responses of animals,
   how they interpret the valence of these responses, and the timescale of
   measure are all important considerations. For example, different
   measures of physiological response may indicate short term coping
   responses, while there may be long term physiological change that could
   influence population dynamics, often beyond the scope of the study. Many
   species are also able to mitigate the effect of tourist disturbance
   through habituation and moderation of short term responses, such as
   avoidance/fleeing responses. In conclusion, therefore, although there
   could be long term consequences to tourist activities, these impacts are
   often not readily measurable. Greater consideration of assessment
   methods to quantify such effects is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Predation danger is pervasive for small mammals and is expected to
   select strongly for behavioural tactics that reduce the risk. In
   particular, since it may be considered a cost of reproduction, predation
   danger is expected to affect the level of reproductive effort. We test
   this hypothesis in a population of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus
   (Ord, 1815)) under seminatural conditions in field enclosures. We
   manipulated the voles' perception of predation danger by adjusting the
   available cover and measured giving up density (GUD) in food patches to
   verify that the perception of danger differed between high-and low-cover
   treatments. Treatments did not differ in actual predation rate, in vole
   density, or in the quantity or quality of food. During the experiments,
   we measured indices of vole reproductive effort including activity
   (electronic detectors), foraging intensity (fecal plates), and the
   number of young produced (livetrapping). Voles in the high-cover (lower
   danger) treatments were more active, foraged more, and produced 85\%
   more young per female per trap period than voles in the low-cover
   (higher danger) treatment. We briefly discuss the population
   consequences of this adaptive behavioural flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{1. Despite being globally widespread in coastal regions, the impacts of
   light pollution on intertidal ecosystems has received little attention.
   Intertidal species exhibit many night-time-dependent ecological
   strategies, including feeding, reproduction, orientation and predator
   avoidance, which are likely negatively affected by shifting light
   regimes, as has been observed in terrestrial and aquatic taxa.
   2. Coastal lighting may shape intertidal communities through its
   influence on the nocturnal foraging activity of dogwhelks (Nucella
   lapillus), a widespread predatory mollusc that structures biodiversity
   in temperate rocky shores. In the laboratory, we investigated whether
   the basal and foraging activity of this predator was affected by
   exposure to night-time lighting both in the presence and absence of
   olfactory predator cues (Carcinus maenas, common shore crab).
   3. Assessments of dogwhelks' behavioural responses to night-time white
   LED lighting were performed on individuals that had been acclimated to
   night-time white LED lighting conditions for 16 days and individuals
   that had not previously been exposed to artificial light at night.
   4. Dogwhelks acclimated to night-time lighting exhibited natural
   refuge-seeking behaviour less often compared to control animals, but
   were more likely to respond to and handle prey irrespective of whether
   olfactory predator cues were present. These responses suggest night-time
   lighting likely increased the energetic demand of dogwhelks through
   stress, encouraging foraging whenever food was available, regardless of
   potential danger. Contrastingly, whelks not acclimated under night-time
   lighting were more likely to respond to the presence of prey under
   artificial light at night when olfactory predator cues were present,
   indicating an opportunistic shift towards the use of visual instead of
   olfactory cues in risk evaluation.
   5. These results demonstrate that artificial night-time lighting
   influences the behaviour of intertidal fauna such that the balance of
   interspecific interactions involved in community structuring may be
   affected.}},

Abstract = {{Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in
   repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly
   understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of
   adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable
   differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in
   repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body
   size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on
   personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual
   variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive
   colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1)
   test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal
   personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and
   boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes
   (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3)
   determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at
   the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation
   along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations
   did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural
   syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance
   in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility
   and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations
   indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P.
   corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable
   between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test
   this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent
   individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to
   provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal

Abstract = {{How does repeated or chronic childhood adversity shape social and

   unique strengths and abilities that develop in response to high-stress
   environments. Evolutionary-developmental models emphasize the coherent,
   functional changes that occur in response to stress over the life
   course. Research in birds, rodents, and humans suggests that
   developmental exposures to stress can improve forms of attention,
   perception, learning, memory, and problem solving that are ecologically

   hypothesis). Many of these skills and abilities, moreover, are primarily
   manifest in currently stressful contexts where they would provide the
   greatest fitness-relevant advantages (as per the sensitization

   approach to resilience that converges on a central question: ``What are

Abstract = {{Understanding the molecular basis of mosquito behavioural complexity
   plays a central role in designing novel molecular tools to fight against
   their vector-borne diseases. Although the olfactory system plays an
   important role in guiding and managing many behavioural responses
   including feeding and mating, but the sex specific regulation of
   olfactory responses remain poorly investigated. From our ongoing
   transcriptomic data annotation of olfactory tissue of blood fed adult
   female An. culicifacies mosquitoes; we have identified a 383 bp long
   unique transcript encoding a Drosophila homolog of the quick-to-court
   protein. Previously this was shown to regulate courtship behaviour in
   adult male Drosophila. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the
   quick-to-court (qtc) gene of An. culicifacies (Ac-qtc) predicts a 1536
   bp single copy gene encoding 511 amino acid protein, having a high
   degree of conservation with other insect homologs. The age-dependent
   increased expression of putative Ac-qtc correlated with the maturation
   of the olfactory system, necessary to meet the sex-specific conflicting
   demand of mating (mate finding) versus host seeking behavioural
   responses. Sixteen to eighteen hours of starvation did not alter Ac-qtc
   expression in both sexes, however, blood feeding significantly modulated
   its response in the adult female mosquitoes, confirming that it may not
   be involved in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. Finally,
   a dual behavioural and molecular assay indicated that natural
   dysregulation of Ac-qtc in the late evening might promote the mating
   events for successful insemination. We hypothesize that Ac-qtc may play
   a unique role to regulate the sex-specific conflicting demand of
   mosquito courtship behaviour versus blood feeding behaviour in the adult
   female mosquitoes. Further elucidation of this molecular mechanism may
   provide further information to evaluate Ac-qtc as a key molecular target
   for mosquito-borne disease management.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging efficiency determines whether animals will be able
   to raise healthy broods, maintain their own condition, avoid predators
   and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS
   loggers, features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable
   conditions can be translated into energetic costs of movement, which, in
   turn, can be translated to energy landscapes. We investigated energy
   landscapes in Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New
   Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands.
   Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters
   of dive depth and the proportion of pelagic and benthic dives varied
   both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes
   also varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to
   differences in food availability, which were also reflected in
   differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic
   niche metrics. In the second year, the energy landscape was
   characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding
   success was also higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three
   South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was never used.
   Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time
   and that the seabirds forage in areas of the energy landscapes that
   result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view
   of energy landscapes and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying
   animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy landscapes
   are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging
   to breeding success.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-dense, yet nutritionally poor food is a high-risk factor for
   mental health disorders. This is of particular concern during
   adolescence, a period often associated with increased consumption of low
   nutritional content food and higher prevalence of mental health
   disorders. Indeed, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms
   linking unhealthy diet and mental disorders. Deficiency in n-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is a hallmark of poor nutrition and
   mood disorders. Here, we developed a mouse model of n-3 PUFA deficiency
   lasting from adolescence into adulthood. Starting nutritional deficits
   in dietary n-3 PUFAs during adolescence decreased n-3 PUFAs in both
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens, increased
   anxiety-like behavior, and decreased cognitive function in adulthood.
   Importantly, we discovered that endocannabinoid/mGlu(5)-mediated LTD in
   the mPFC and accumbens was abolished in adult n-3-deficient mice.
   Additionally, mPFC NMDAR-dependent LTP was also lacking in the
   n-3-deficient group. Pharmacological enhancement of the mGlu(5)/eCB
   signaling complex, by positive allosteric modulation of mGlu(5) or
   inhibition of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol degradation, fully
   restored synaptic plasticity and normalized emotional and cognitive
   behaviors in malnourished adult mice. Our data support a model where
   nutrition is a key environmental factor influencing the working synaptic

   understand the pattern of reaction time, morphometric data were also

   significantly different TI times found in this study, one captive

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{The decisions animals make to adjust their antipredator behavior to
   rapidly changing conditions have been well studied. Inducible defenses
   in plants are an antipredator behavior that acts on a longer time scale,
   but sensitive plants, Mimosa pudica, have a much more rapid antipredator
   response; they temporarily close their leaves when touched. The time
   they remain closed is defined as hiding time. We studied hiding time in
   sensitive plants and found that individual plants differed significantly
   in their hiding times. We then showed that the effect of individual
   explained substantial variation in hiding time on a short time scale.
   Finally, on a longer time scale, individuality persisted but the amount
   of variation attributed to individual decreased. We hypothesized that
   variation in plant condition might explain this change. We therefore
   manipulated sunlight availability and quantified hiding time. When
   deprived of light for 6 h, sensitive plants significantly shortened
   their hiding times. But when only half a plant was deprived of light,
   hiding times on the deprived half and light exposed half were not
   significantly different. This suggests that overall condition best
   explains variation in sensitive plant antipredator behavior. Just like
   in animals, sensitive plant antipredator behavior is condition
   dependent, and, just like in animals, a substantial amount of the
   remaining variation is explained by individual differences between
   plants. Thus, models designed to predict plasticity in animal behavior
   may be successfully applied to understand behavior in other organisms,

Abstract = {{Background: Addressing impaired foetal growth is recognized as a public
   health priority. Certain risk factors for this condition, such as poor
   nutritional status at birth, have been found to be highly correlated
   with poverty. However, the role of psychosocial factors, specifically
   the mother's mental health and exposure to violence during pregnancy,
   have yet to be further explored. Our objective was to determine if there
   is a measurable association between combined psychosocial factors,
   specifically domestic violence and mental disorders, and birth outcomes,
   specifically birth nutritional status and preterm delivery.
   Methods: We followed 775 women from an underserved, urban area,
   beginning their 28th week of gestation. Diagnostic interviews were
   performed to determine if any of the mothers had any of the following
   disorders: mood disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
   substance dependence, psychotic disorder, or anti-social personality
   disorder. Physical, psychological, and sexual domestic violence were
   also assessed.
   Results: Domestic violence and mental disorders were highly correlated
   in our sample. About 27.15\% of the women in our study experienced
   domestic violence, and about 38.24\% of them were diagnosed with mental
   disorders. The main association we found between combined psychosocial
   factors and neonate outcomes was between anxiety (IRR = 1.83; 95\% CI =
   1.06-3.17)/physical violence (IRR = 1.95; 95\% CI = 1.11-3.42) and the
   rate of small-for-gestational age (SGA) in new-borns. More specifically,
   the combination of anxiety (beta = -0.48; 95\% CI = -0.85/-0.10) and
   sexual violence (beta = -1.58; 95\% CI = -2.61/-0.54) was also
   associated with birth length. Maternal risk behaviours such as smoking,
   drinking, inadequate prenatal care, and inadequate weight gain could not
   sufficiently explain these associations, suggesting that these
   psychosocial factors may be influencing underlying biological
   mechanisms.
   Conclusion: Domestic violence against women and mental disorders amongst
   pregnant women are extremely prevalent in under-resourced, urban areas
   and ultimately, have detrimental effects on birth outcomes. It is
   imperative that actions be taken to prevent violence and improve mental
   health during pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Individual versus collective decision making: optimal foraging in the

Abstract = {{Collective decision making is one of the main mechanisms of organization
   in social insects. However, individual decision making can also play an
   important role, depending on the type of foraging behaviour. In the
   termite-hunting ant species Megaponera analis information about foraging
   sites is collected by only a handful of individual scouts that have to
   convey this information to the colony as accurately as possible to
   optimize their foraging behaviour. We therefore looked at predictions
   made by optimal foraging theory to better understand the interplay
   between collective and individual decision making in this obligate
   group-raiding predator. We found a clear positive relation between raid
   size (200-500 ants) and termite abundance at the foraging site thereby
   confirming predictions of the maximization of energy theory.
   Furthermore, selectivity of the food source increased with distance,
   thus confirming central place prediction theory. The confirmation of
   these theories suggests that individual scouts must be the main driver
   behind raid size, choice and raiding behaviour. The marginal value
   theorem was also confirmed by our results: time spent at the hunting
   ground increased with distance and prey quantity. This raises questions
   on how foraging time at the food source is regulated in a group-hunting
   predator. Hunger decreased selectivity of scouts with respect to food
   sources, while average raid size increased and more scouts left the nest
   in search of prey, thus implying that scouts are aware of the hunger
   state of the colony and adapt their decision making accordingly.
   Remarkably, most central place foraging behaviours in M. analis were not
   achieved by collective decisions but rather by individual decisions of
   scout ants. Thus, 1\% of the colony (10-20 scouts) decided the fate and
   foraging efficiency of the remaining 99\%. (C) 2017 The Association for

Title = {{Hens vary their vocal repertoire and structure when anticipating
   different types of reward}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{79-96}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The vocalizations of nonhuman animals are considered potential
   indicators of motivational or internal state. In many species, different
   call types, and structural variation within call types, encode
   information about physical characteristics such as age or sex, or about
   variable traits such as motivation. Domestic chickens, Gallus gallus,
   have an elaborate vocal repertoire, enabling investigation into whether
   reward-related arousal is encoded within their call type and structure.
   Twelve hens were given a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm using sound
   cues to signal the availability of two food rewards (mealworms, normal
   food), one nonfood reward (a container of substrate suitable for
   dustbathing), and a sound-neutral event (sound cue, no reward). A
   muted-neutral treatment (no sound cue, no reward) provided a baseline
   for vocal behaviour. Sound cues preceded a 15 s anticipation period
   during which vocalizations were recorded. Hens produced a `Food call'
   (previously defined in other studies) in anticipation of all rewards,
   including the nonfood reward. `Food calls' and `Fast clucks' were more
   prevalent in anticipation of rewards, and most prevalent following the
   cue signalling the dustbathing substrate, suggesting that this reward
   induced the most arousal in hens. The peak frequency of `Food calls'
   made in anticipation of the dustbathing substrate was significantly
   lower than those made in anticipation of food rewards, potentially
   reflecting differences in arousal. Vocalizations that reliably indicate
   hens' motivational state could be used as measures of welfare in on-farm
   assessment situations. Our study is the first to reveal variation in the
   frequency-related parameters of the `Food call' in different contexts,
   and to show the prevalence of different call types in reward and
   nonreward contexts, which may have implications for welfare assessments.

Title = {{Resource availability and sexual size dimorphism: differential effects
   of prey abundance on the growth rates of tropical snakes}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Broad phylogenetic patterns in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) are
   shaped by sex differences in net selection pressures (e.g. sexual
   selection, fecundity selection, survival selection), but environmental
   and ecological factors can also affect the expression of SSD.
   2. Discussions of proximate ecological influences on SSD have focused on
   niche divergence; for example, increase in a prey type used by only one
   sex can elevate growth rates of that sex but not the other. Food
   limitation also can generate spatial and temporal variation in SSD.
   Under restricted prey abundance, curtailed growth may mask SSD even if
   the optimal size is greater for one sex than the other. Because an
   increase in food availability elicits increased feeding and growth by
   the sex that benefits more from increased body size, variation in prey
   abundance can generate variation in SSD.
   3. We used mark-recapture methods to study growth rates relative to prey
   (frog) abundance in two species of sexually dimorphic colubrid snake
   species in tropical Australia.
   4. In slatey-grey snakes (Stegonotus cucullatus), a species in which
   larger body size enhances reproductive output in both sexes (because
   larger males win combat bouts, and larger females produce more/heavier
   eggs), increased abundance of frogs caused equivalent increases in
   growth rates in both sexes and hence did not affect SSD. In keelbacks
   (Tropidonophis mairii), a species in which larger size enhances
   reproductive output in females more than males (reflecting a lack of
   male-male combat), increased abundance of frogs elicited higher growth
   rates of females only. Thus, SSD in keelbacks was modified by prey
   abundance.
   5. Our results show that the magnitude of sex differences in adult body
   size can be influenced by proximate environmental factors and support
   the hypothesis of sex-specific targets for maximum feeding rates.}},

Abstract = {{The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) is an
   obligate blood-sucking insect that has been resurging in many countries.
   Researching this pest's behavior will help design more effective control
   methods. In this study, we evaluated the effect of feeding history and
   time elapsed from field collection on bed bug movement behavior and
   response to chemical lure or carbon dioxide stimulation in the
   laboratory. After CO2 was released, bed bugs unfed for 3 d began to
   return to harborages; in contrast, the ones unfed for 2 and 4 wk spent
   significantly more time outside their harborages during the first 1 h
   after than the 1 h before CO2 release. After CO2 release, there was an
   increase in activity (time spent moving outside harborage) in all bed
   bugs with different feeding history or time elapsed from field
   collection. During the 8-h observation period when CO2 was present, bed
   bug males unfed for 4 wk spent significantly more time exploring outside
   harborages than the ones unfed for 3 d, 1 wk, and 2 wk. Nymphs collected
   1-2 wk and 1 yr ago spent significantly more time exploring outside
   harborages than the ones collected 43 yr ago. Bed bug's exploratory
   activity (the total percentage of bed bugs trapped in both baited and
   unbaited interceptors) was significantly affected by their time elapsed
   from field collection and their exploratory activity level was 1-2 wk >
   6mo > 5 and 43 yr. Both feeding history and time elapsed from field
   collection significantly affected bed bug movement, whereas bed bug's
   response to chemical lure or CO2 (the percentage of bed bugs trapped in
   the baited interceptor, summarized as the number of bed bugs trapped in
   the baited interceptor divided by the total number of trapped bed bugs
   in both baited and unbaited interceptors) was unaffected by the time
   elapsed from field collection.}},

Volume = {{202}},
Pages = {{25-38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Livestock production to provide food for a growing world population,
   with increasing demand for meat and milk products, has led to a rapid
   growth in the scale of cattle and pig enterprises globally. However,
   consumers and the wider society are also increasingly concerned about
   the welfare, health and living conditions of farm animals. Awareness of
   animal needs underpins new production standards for animal health and
   welfare. Pig and cattle behaviour can provide information about their
   barn environmental situation, food and water adequacy, health, welfare
   and production efficiency. Real-time scoring of cattle and pig
   behaviours is challenging, but the increasing availability and
   sophistication of technology makes automated monitoring of animal
   behaviour practicable. Machine vision techniques, as novel technologies,
   can provide an automated, non-contact, non stress and cost-effective way
   to achieve animal behaviour monitoring requirements. This review
   describes the state of the art in 3D imaging systems (i.e. depth sensor
   and time of flight cameras) along with 2D cameras for effectively
   identifying livestock behaviours, and presents automated approaches for
   monitoring and investigation of cattle and pig feeding, drinking, lying,
   locomotion, aggressive and reproductive behaviours. The performance of
   developed systems is reviewed in terms of sensitivity, specificity,
   accuracy, error rate and precision. These technologies can support the
   farmer by monitoring normal behaviours and early detection of abnormal
   behaviours in large scale enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{Growth in cattle may be related to animal temperament via alterations in
   intake or feed conversion. However, temperament is ill-defined, and
   different temperament measures may relate differently to production
   traits or interact with dietary factors in their effects. To examine
   relationships between diet, temperament, growth, and health, 160
   crossbred steers (262 +/- 22 kg) were used in a 56-d RCBD experiment
   with a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial treatment structure with 5 pens/treatment.
   Steers were pen fed a corn silage-based diet with or without monensin
   (41.9 g/t DM), ad libitum. Temperament treatments (assigned on d -7)
   were exit velocity (EV; slow vs. fast) and objective chute score (OCS;
   low vs. high), a novel temperament measure, representing the CV of
   weights collected at 5 measures/s for 10 s while an animal's head was
   restrained in a chute. Both were measured on d. 7, 0, 14, 28, 55, and
   56. Subjective chute scores (SCS; visual estimates of animal activity
   obtained simultaneously with OCS measures) were measured on d -7 and d
   56. Jugular blood samples from d 28 were analyzed for antibody response
   to leptospirosis vaccine and NEFA concentrations. No monensin x OCS x EV
   interactions were detected (P >= 0.11). There was a positive correlation
   between SCS and OCS (P < 0.01; r = 0.57). Changes in OCS and EV across
   the duration of the study differed among treatments (treatment x day, P
   < 0.10) and indicated that initial measures may be better proxies of
   growth than average measures. There were no interactions between EV and
   OCS (P >= 0.15) for any response variable and no interactions among
   treatments (P >= 0.31), nor main effects of temperament factors (P >=
   0.12) for DMI (\%BW). Monensin decreased DMI (P < 0.01) similarly across
   all levels of EV and OCS. Gains and G:F responses to monensin depended
   on OCS (P < 0.10) but not EV (P >= 0.80). Gain was reduced (P < 0.10) by
   monensin with low, but not high, OCS, and G: F was increased (P < 0.10)
   by monensin on high, but not low, OCS. Gain during the second 4 wk was
   lesser (P = 0.04) in fast, compared with slow, EV animals. Results
   provide novel indications that certain temperament measures can interact
   with dietary manipulation to influence animal performance.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Using the 2000-2013 waves of the German SOEP, this paper shows that
   non-cognitive skills have a predictive power on unemployment
   transitions. The econometric approach is based on a dynamic random
   effects probit model that takes account of the unobserved individual
   heterogeneity and the state dependence that surrounds unemployment
   transitions. The estimation results show that the risk of unemployment
   depends positively on Agreeableness and External LOC, and negatively on
   Conscientiousness and Positive Reciprocity. These findings apply to men
   and women alike. Moreover, we find that the extent of unemployment state
   dependence also depends on specific traits, namely Openness, Positive
   reciprocity and External LOC. These results suggest that public policies
   aimed at preventing unemployment should give more importance to the
   moderating role of non-cognitive skills. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{BackgroundThere is limited research in young infants, particularly
   <3months of age, on maternal feeding practices in spite of increasing
   evidence that early weight gain velocity is a determinant of later
   obesity risk.
   ObjectiveTo examine associations between maternal executive function
   (cognitive control over one's own behaviour), maternal feeding decisions
   and infant weight and adiposity gains.
   MethodsWe used a checklist to assess cues mothers use to decide when to
   initiate and terminate infant feedings at 2weeks and 3months of age
   (N=69). Maternal executive function was assessed using the NIH Toolbox
   Cognition Battery subtests for executive function and infant body
   composition using air displacement plethysmography.
   ResultsMothers with higher executive function reported relying on fewer
   non-satiety cues at 2weeks of age (=-0.29, p=0.037) and on more infant
   hunger cues at 3months of age (=0.31, p=0.018) in their decisions on
   initiating and terminating feedings. Responsive feeding decisions,
   specifically the use of infant-based hunger cues at 3months, in turn
   were associated with lower gains in weight-for-length (=-0.30, p=0.028)
   and percent body fat (=-0.2, p=0.091; non-covariate adjusted =-0.27,
   p=0.029).
   ConclusionsThese findings show both an association between maternal
   executive function and responsive feeding decisions and an association
   between responsive feeding decisions and infant weight and adiposity
   gains. The causal nature and direction of these associations require
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The translation of the growing increase of findings emerging from basic

Abstract = {{Sympatric predators are predicted to partition resources, especially
   under conditions of food limitation. Spatial heterogeneity that
   influences prey availability might play an important role in the scales
   at which potential competitors select habitat. We assessed potential
   mechanisms for coexistence by examining the role of heterogeneity in
   resource partitioning between sympatric raptors overwintering in the
   southern Great Plains. We conducted surveys for wintering Red-tailed
   hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyanea) at two
   state wildlife management areas in Oklahoma, USA. We used information
   from repeated distance sampling to project use locations in a GIS. We
   applied resource selection functions to model habitat selection at three
   scales and analyzed for niche partitioning using the outlying mean
   index. Habitat selection of the two predators was mediated by spatial
   heterogeneity. The two predators demonstrated significant fine-scale
   discrimination in habitat selection in homogeneous landscapes, but were
   more sympatric in heterogeneous landscapes. Red-tailed hawk used a
   variety of cover types in heterogeneous landscapes but specialized on
   riparian forest in homogeneous landscapes. Northern Harrier specialized
   on upland grasslands in homogeneous landscapes but selected more cover
   types in heterogeneous landscapes. Our study supports the growing body
   of evidence that landscapes can affect animal behaviors. In the system
   we studied, larger patches of primary land cover types were associated
   with greater allopatry in habitat selection between two potentially
   competing predators. Heterogeneity within the scale of raptor home
   ranges was associated with greater sympatry in use and less
   specialization in land cover types selected.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical transmission of glucocorticoids via breast milk might pose a
   mechanism through which lactating women could prepare their infants for
   the postnatal environment. The primary source of breast milk
   glucocorticoids is probably the systemic circulation. Research from our
   group showed that milk cortisol and cortisone concentrations follow the
   diurnal rhythm of maternal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity,
   with a higher abundance of cortisone compared to cortisol. Measurement
   of breast-milk glucocorticoid concentrations is challenging due to
   possible cross-reactivity with progestagens and sex steroids, which are
   severely elevated during pregnancy and after parturition. This requires
   precise methods that are not hindered by cross reactivity, such as
   LC-MS/MS. There are some data suggesting that breast-milk
   glucocorticoids could promote intestinal maturation, either locally or
   after absorption into the systemic circulation. Breast-milk
   glucocorticoids might also have an effect on the intestinal microbiome,
   although this has not been studied thus far. Findings from studies
   investigating the systemic effects of breast-milk glucocorticoids are
   difficult to interpret, since none took the diurnal rhythm of
   glucocorticoids in breast milk into consideration, and various
   analytical methods were used. Nevertheless, glucocorticoids in breast
   milk might offer a novel potential pathway for signal transmission from
   mothers to their infants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Organisms react to environmental changes through plastic responses that
   often involve physiological alterations with the potential to modify
   life-history traits and fitness. Environmentally induced shifts in
   growth and development in species with complex life cycles determine the
   timing of transitions between subsequent life stages, as well as body
   condition at transformation, which greatly determine survival at later
   stages. Here we show that spadefoot toad larvae surviving pond drying
   and predators experienced marked alterations in growth and development,
   and in their fat reserves, oxidative stress, and relative telomere
   length. Tadpoles accelerated development but reduced growth and consumed
   more fat reserves when facing pond drying. However, oxidative stress was
   buffered by increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and telomeres
   remained unchanged. Predators caused opposite effects: they reduced
   larval density, hence relaxing competition and allowing faster
   development and enhanced growth of survivors. Tadpoles surviving
   predators metamorphosed bigger and had larger fat bodies, increasing
   their short-term survival odds, but showed signs of oxidative stress and
   had shorter telomeres. Developmental acceleration and enhanced growth
   thus seemed to have different physiological consequences: reduced fat
   bodies and body size compromise short-term survival, but are reversible

Title = {{Examining the relationship between the food environment and adult
   diabetes prevalence by county economic and racial composition: an
   ecological study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inequitable access to healthy food may contribute to health
   disparities. This study examines the relationship between the prevalence
   of adult diabetes and food access in the U.S. by county economic/racial
   composition.
   Methods: An ecological study from 2012 was used to estimate the
   relationship between diabetes and retail food outlet access. County
   diabetes prevalence was measured based on individual responses to the
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey question, ``Have you ever
   been told by a doctor that you have diabetes?{''} If the answer was
   ``yes{''} individuals were classified as having diabetes. Retail food
   outlets included grocery stores, supercenters, farmer's markets,
   full-service restaurants, fast food restaurants and convenience stores.
   Counties were categorized as ``high-poverty{''} or ``low-poverty{''}.
   Counties were categorized as low (< 4.6\%), medium (4.6\%-31.0\%), and
   high (> 31.0\%) percent minority residents. Multiple linear regression
   models estimated the association between retail food outlets and
   diabetes, controlling for confounders, and testing for interactions
   between retail food outlets and county racial composition. Regression
   models were conditioned on county economic composition. Data were
   analyzed in 2016.
   Results: Density of retail foods outlets varied greatly by county
   economic and racial composition; counties with medium-minority
   populations had the least access to grocery stores and the highest
   access to fast food restaurants and convenience stores. Low
   poverty/low-minority population counties had the greatest access to
   farmer's markets and grocery stores. For low poverty/low-minority
   counties, grocery stores were associated with decreased of diabetes
   prevalence. Supercenters were associated with an increase in diabetes
   prevalence for high-poverty/low-minority counties. Only low
   poverty/medium-minority counties had a statistically significant
   relationship between farmer's markets and diabetes prevalence. Fast food
   restaurants were found to be positively associated with diabetes
   prevalence in all counties except high poverty/medium-minority. However,
   only low poverty/low-minority counties had a statistically significant
   relationship. Across all models, access to full service restaurants were
   significantly associated with lower prevalence of diabetes. Generally,
   access to convenience stores were associated with increased diabetes
   prevalence, except for high poverty/low-minority counties.
   Conclusions: The food environment is more strongly associated with
   diabetes prevalence for wealthier counties with a lower proportion of
   minority residents. This is important given efforts to increase food
   access in vulnerable communities. Availability of healthier food may not
   be enough to change health outcomes.}},

   behavior}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Animals often view humans as predators, leading to alterations in their
   behavior. Even nuanced aspects of human activity like clothing color
   affect animal behavior, but we lack an understanding of when and where
   such effects will occur. The species confidence hypothesis posits that
   birds are attracted to colors found on their bodies and repelled by
   non-body colors. Here, we extend this hypothesis taxonomically and
   conceptually to test whether this pattern is applicable in a non-avian
   reptile and to suggest that species should respond less fearfully to
   their sexually-selected signaling color. Responses to clothing color
   could also be impacted by habituation to humans, so we examine whether
   behavior varied between areas with low and high human activity. We
   quantified the effects of four T-shirt colors on flight initiation
   distances (FID) and on the ease of capture in western fence lizards
   (Sceloporus occidentalis), and we accounted for detectability against
   the background environment. We found no differences in lizard behavior
   between sites. However, lizards tolerated the closest approaches and
   were most likely to be captured when approached with the T-shirt that
   resembled their sexually-selected signaling color. Because changes in
   individual behavior affect fitness, choice of clothing color by people,
   including tourists, hikers, and researchers, could impact wildlife
   populations and research outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In this time of massive global change, species are now frequently
   interacting with novel players. Greater insight into the impact of these
   novel interactions on traits linked to fitness is essential, because
   effects on these traits can hinder population existence or promote rapid
   adaptation. Sexually selected weapons and ornaments frequently influence
   fitness and often have heightened condition-dependence in response to
   nutrition. Condition-dependence in response to different ecological
   conditions, a form of developmental plasticity, may be responsible for
   much of the intraspecific variation in sexually selected ornaments and
   weapons in wild populations. Here we examined the consequences of
   developing on a novel plant for the expression of size and shape in the
   leaf-footed cactus bug Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae). Themales
   of this species possess enlarged, sexually dimorphic femurs on their
   hind legs. These legs are used as weapons in male-male contests. Females
   are typically larger in overall body size. Our study revealed that
   developing upon a novel host can lead to pronounced phenotypically
   plastic change in sexually dimorphic traits. Male hind femurs were
   greatly impacted by the novel diet to the extent that the sexual
   dimorphism in hind femurs was lost. Further, dimorphismin body size
   increased, as males became tiny adults while females better maintained
   their body size. These patterns underscore the complex effects that
   novel species interactions may have on sexual phenotypes.}},

Volume = {{372}},

Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Group living has been proposed to yield benefits that enhance fitness
   above the level that would be achieved through living as solitary
   individuals. Dominance hierarchies occur commonly in these social
   assemblages, and result, by definition, in resources not being evenly
   distributed between group members. Determinants of rank within a
   dominance hierarchy can be associated with morphological
   characteristics, previous experience of the individual, or personality
   traits such as exploration tendencies. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate whether greater exploration and positive responses to novel
   objects in homing pigeons (Columba livia) measured under laboratory
   conditions were associated with (i) greater initial exploration of the
   local area around the home loft during spontaneous exploration flights
   (SEF), (ii) faster and more efficient homing flights when released from
   further afield, and (iii) whether the traits of greater exploration and
   more positive responses to novel objects were more likely to be
   exhibited by the more dominant individuals within the group. There was
   no relationship between laboratory-based novel object exploration and
   position within the dominance hierarchy. Pigeons that were neophobic
   under laboratory conditions did not explore the local area during SEF
   opportunities. When released from sites further from home, neophobic
   pigeons took longer routes to home compared to those birds that had not
   exhibited neophobic traits under laboratory conditions, and had
   spontaneously explored to a greater extent. The lack of exploration in
   the neophobic birds is likely to have resulted in the increased costs of
   homing following release: unfamiliarity with the landscape likely led to
   the greater distances travelled and less efficient routes taken. Birds
   that demonstrated a lack of neophobia were not the dominant individuals
   inside the loft, and thus would have less access to resources such as
   food and potentially mates. However, a lack of neophobia makes the
   subordinate position possible, because subordinate birds that incur high
   travel costs would become calorie restricted and lose condition. Our
   results address emerging questions linking individual variation in
   behaviour with energetics and fitness consequences.

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the body

   Methods: In total, 953 subjects aged over 20 years were recruited in

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Alternative behavioral strategies typically differ in their associated
   risks, meaning that a different variance in fitness-related outcomes
   characterizes each behavior. Understanding how selection acts on risk
   preference is crucial to interpreting and predicting behavior. Despite
   much research, most theoretical frameworks have been laid out as
   optimization problems from the individual's perspective, and the
   influence of population dynamics has been underappreciated. We use
   agentbased simulations that implement competition between two simple
   behavioral strategies to illuminate effects of population dynamics on
   risk-taking. We explore the effects of inter-generational reproduction
   dynamics, population size, the number of decisions throughout an
   individual's life, and simple alternate distributions of risk. We find
   that these factors, very often ignored in empirical and theoretical
   studies of behavior, can have significant and non-intuitive impacts on
   the selection of alternative behavioral strategies. Our results
   demonstrate that simple rules regarding predicted risk preference do not
   hold across the complete range of each of the factors we studied; we
   propose intuitive interpretations for the dynamics within each regime.
   We suggest that studies of behavioral strategies should explicitly take
   into account the species' life history and the ecological context in
   which selection acted on the riskrelated behavior of the organism of

Abstract = {{Behavioural decisions are often context-dependent, where information
   from immediate experience is incorporated into an individual's
   decision-making, particularly in complex environments. To test whether
   such mechanism is adopted by foragers in heterogeneous environments, we
   investigated the foraging behaviour of the deposit-feeding sand-bubbler
   crab, Scopimera intermedia. An individual-based model was constructed,
   based on an optimal-patch selection criterion, which implicitly assumed
   that individuals adjust foraging decisions based on immediate past
   experience. The model's predictions were tested on the shore by
   manipulating the location of food patches, where the crab showed a
   strong context-dependent foraging pattern. When resources were randomly
   distributed, the crab responded by spending 56\% of time in enriched
   patches compared with only 28\% in the same area when patches were
   composed of natural sediments. Shore manipulations varying resource
   distribution supported the underlying principles of the model mechanism,
   and highlighted the benefits of such a strategy in heterogeneous

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Nutrient deprivation during early development has been associated with
   the predisposition to metabolic disorders in adulthood. Considering its
   interaction with metabolism, appetite and behavior, the endocannabinoid
   (eCB) system represents a promising target of developmental programming.
   Methods
   By cross-fostering and variation of litter size, early postnatal
   nutrition of CB6F1-hybrid mice was controlled during the lactation
   period (3, 6, or 10 pups/mother). After weaning and redistribution at
   P21, all pups received standard chow ad libitum. Gene expression
   analyses (liver, visceral fat, hypothalamus) were performed at P50, eCB
   concentrations were determined in liver and visceral fat. Locomotor
   activity and social behavior were analyzed by means of computer-assisted
   videotracking.
   Results
   Body growth was permanently altered, with differences for length,
   weight, body mass index and fat mass persisting beyond P100 (all 3>6>10,
   p<0.01). This was paralleled by differences in hepatic IGF-I expression
   (p<0.01). Distinct gene expression patterns for key enzymes of the eCB
   system were observed in fat (eCB-synthesis: 3>6>10 (DAGL alpha p<0.05;
   NAPE-PLD p = 0.05)) and liver (eCB-degradation: 3>6>10 (FAAH p<0.05; MGL
   p<0.01)). Concentrations of endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG in liver and
   visceral fat were largely comparable, except for a borderline
   significance for higher AEA (liver, p = 0.049) in formerly overfed mice
   and, vice versa, tendencies (p<0.1) towards lower AEA (fat) and 2-AG
   (liver) in formerly underfed animals. In the arcuate nucleus, formerly
   underfed mice tended to express more eCB-receptor transcripts (CB1R
   p<0.05; CB2R p = 0.08) than their overfed fellows. Open-field social
   behavior testing revealed significant group differences, with formerly
   underfed mice turning out to be the most sociable animals (p<0.01).
   Locomotor activity did not differ.
   Conclusion
   Our data indicate a developmental plasticity of somatic growth, behavior
   and parameters of the eCB system, with long-lasting impact of early
   postnatal nutrition. Developmental programming of the eCB system in
   metabolically active tissues, as shown here for liver and fat, may play
   a role in the formation of the adult cardiometabolic risk profile
   following perinatal malnutrition in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Psychosocial stress is associated with an increased intake of palatable
   foods and weight gain in stress reactive individuals. Personality traits
   have been shown to predict stress-reactivity. However, it is not known
   if personality traits influence brain activity in regions implicated in
   appetite control during psychosocial stress. The current study assessed
   whether Gray's Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) scale, a measure of
   stress-reactivity, was related to the activity of brain regions
   implicated in appetite control during a stressful period. Twenty-two
   undergraduate students participated in a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) experiment once during a non-exam period and once during
   final exams in a counter-balanced order. In the scanner, they viewed
   food and scenery pictures. In the exam compared with the non-exam
   condition, BIS scores related to increased perceived stress and
   correlated with increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response
   to high-calorie food images in regions implicated in food reward and
   subjective value, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, (vmPFC)
   and the amygdala. BIS scores negatively related to the functional
   connectivity between the vmPFC and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   The results demonstrate that the BIS trait influences stress reactivity.
   This is observed both as an increased activity in brain regions
   implicated in computing the value of food cues and decreased
   connectivity of these regions to prefrontal regions implicated in
   self-control. This suggests that the effects of real life stress on
   appetitive brain function and self-control is modulated by a personality
   trait. This may help to explain why stressful periods can lead to
   overeating in vulnerable individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Policy decisions have the potential to affect biodiversity conservation
   and modify, among other factors, animal demography, behavior and
   ecological processes. This became manifest in Europe in the past decade
   in light of the appearance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
   However, the obvious effects of policy decisions on foraging behavior
   are lacking. Here, we use data from a long-term study (1992-2015) of the
   ecology of the bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus in the Pyrenees to
   assess whether or not the implementation of health policies in the
   period 2006-2011 really did affect this vultures foraging behavior and
   breeding success. To test this, we used the frequency of nest
   changeovers (between 1992 and 2015) as a surrogate for the time invested
   in searching for and obtaining food. Additionally, between 2006 and 2015
   we monitored the movements of 20 bearded vultures with GPS satellite
   transmitters. Our findings show no differences between annual home range
   sizes and/or the time used to search for food either before, during or
   after the imposition of health regulations. No differences between
   periods (during or after health regulations) were found in the use of
   supplementary feeding sites (SFS). An analysis of food available
   indicates that this similarity of use in different periods could be
   explained by the high habitat quality in the Pyrenees and the good
   availability of trophic resources. Our results suggest that diet
   plasticity and habitat quality compensate for the sudden effects of food
   shortages and so question the true usefulness of SFS in buffering a
   quantitative food deficit. We discuss the implications of these results
   from both ecological and conservation perspectives.}},

Pages = {{64-71}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diabetes and depression are reciprocally linked, but few
   studies modeled their interplay considering the influence of affective
   temperaments (AT) and demographic factors.
   Methods: Participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1DM and T2DM, n
   = 279) recruited from Diabetes Units were assessed with the Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI), Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa,
   Paris and San Diego-autoquestionnaire version (TEMPS-A), Morisky
   Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) and
   Cumulative Illness Rating Scales (CIRS). Glycosylated hemoglobin levels
   (HBA1C) was used as index of glycemic control. The bi-directional
   association between glycemic control, depression and candidate mediators
   was examined with Structural Equation Modeling, testing the impact of
   moderator variables (AT, diabetes type, age and gender) with multigroup
   comparison.
   Results: The association between HBA1C and depressive symptoms was
   mediated by diabetes-related distress,, while there was no definite
   evidence of depression influencing HBA1C through changes of adherence,
   tiredness, appetite, alcohol intake or smoking. Among individuals with
   AT, distress was unrelated to HBA1C and had a higher impact on
   depression; adherence was inversely association with HBA1C. Moreover,
   physical comorbidities impacted on depression. While diabetes type had a
   moderation role, age and gender did not affect the model.
   Limitations: Cross sectional design, lack of objective measures of diet
   and physical activity.
   Conclusions: Glycemic control seem to influence the severity of
   depressive symptoms, but the reciprocal association seems
   non-significant. AT and diabetes type may shape this relationship
   influencing distress and adherence to medications. Findings may aid
   interventions aimed at improving patients' care and quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{In psychiatry, comparative analyses of therapeutic options and the

   approaches play an important role in clinical decision making, treatment
   guidelines, and health policy. This approach assumes that trials of
   pharmacological and behavioural therapies generally produce the same
   level of evidence when properly designed. However, trial design for
   behavioural interventions has some unique characteristics and control
   groups vary widely, which influence the effects observed in any given
   trial. In this Personal View, we review various control conditions
   typically used in psychiatry, outline their effect on the internal
   validity and expected effect size of a trial, and propose a decision
   framework for choosing a control condition depending on the risk to the
   patient population and the stage of development of the therapeutic

Abstract = {{Objective: Among young children excessive externalizing behaviors often
   predict adolescent conduct and substance use disorders. Adolescents with
   those disorders show aberrant brain function when choosing between risky
   or cautious options. We therefore asked whether similarly aberrant brain
   function during risky decision making accompanies excessive
   externalizing behaviors among children, hypothesizing an association
   between externalizing severity and regional intensity of brain
   activation during risky decision-making.
   Method: Fifty-eight (58) 9-11 year-old children (both sexes), half
   community-recruited, half with substance treated relatives, had
   parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing scores. During fMRI,
   children repeatedly chose between doing a cautious behavior earning 1
   point or a risky behavior that won 5 or lost 10 points. Conservative
   permutation-based whole-brain regression analyses sought brain regions
   where, during decision-making, activation significantly associated with
   externalizing score, with sex, and with their interaction.
   Results: Before risky responses higher externalizing scores were
   significantly, negatively associated with neural activation (t's:
   2.91-4.76) in regions including medial prefrontal cortex (monitors
   environmental reward-punishment schedules), insula (monitors internal
   motivating states, e.g., hunger, anxiety), dopaminergic striatal and
   midbrain structures (anticipate and mediate reward), and cerebellum
   (where injuries actually induce externalizing behaviors). Before
   cautious responses there were no significant externalizing:activation
   associations (except in post hoc exploratory analyses), no significant
   sex differences in activation, and no significant sex-by externalizing
   interactions.
   Conclusions: Among children displaying more externalizing behaviors
   extensive decision-critical brain regions were hypoactive before risky
   behaviors. Such neural hypoactivity may contribute to the excessive
   real-life risky decisions that often produce externalizing behaviors.
   Substance exposure, minimal here, was a very unlikely cause.}},

Abstract = {{All too often, studies of sexual selection focus exclusively on the
   responses in one sex, on single traits, typically those that are
   exaggerated and strongly sexually dimorphic. They ignore a range of less
   obvious traits and behavior, in both sexes, involved in the interactions
   leading to mate choice. To remedy this imbalance, we analyze a textbook
   example of sexual selection in the stalk-eyed fly (Diasemopsis
   meigenii). We studied several traits in a novel, insightful, and
   efficient experimental design, examining 2,400 male-female pairs in a
   round-robin array, where each female was tested against multiple males
   and vice versa. In D.meigenii, females exhibit strong mate preference
   for males with highly exaggerated eyespan, and so we deliberately
   constrained variation in male eyespan to reveal the importance of other
   traits. Males performing more precopulatory behavior were more likely to
   attempt to mate with females and be accepted by them. However, behavior
   was not a necessary part of courtship, as it was absent from over almost
   half the interactions. Males with larger reproductive organs (testes and
   accessory glands) did not make more mating attempts, but there was a
   strong tendency for females to accept mating attempts from such males.
   How females detect differences in male reproductive organ size remains
   unclear. In addition, females with larger eyespan, an indicator of size
   and fecundity, attracted more mating attempts from males, but this trait
   did not alter female acceptance. Genetic variation among males had a
   strong influence on male mating attempts and female acceptance, both via
   the traits we studied and other unmeasured attributes. These findings
   demonstrate the importance of assaying multiple traits in males and
   females, rather than focusing solely on prominent and exaggerated
   sexually dimorphic traits. The approach allows a more complete
   understanding of the complex mating decisions made by both males and
   females.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: An absence of food literacy measurement tools makes it
   challenging for nutrition practitioners to assess the impact of food
   literacy on healthy diets and to evaluate the outcomes of food literacy
   interventions. The objective of the present scoping review was to
   identify the attributes of food literacy.
   Design: A scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was
   conducted and attributes of food literacy identified. Subjects included
   in the search were high-risk groups. Eligible articles were limited to
   research from Canada, USA, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.
   Results: The search identified nineteen peer-reviewed and thirty grey
   literature sources. Fifteen identified food literacy attributes were
   organized into five categories. Food and Nutrition Knowledge informs
   decisions about intake and distinguishing between healthy' and
   unhealthy' foods. Food Skills focuses on techniques of food purchasing,
   preparation, handling and storage. Self-Efficacy and Confidence
   represent one's capacity to perform successfully in specific situations.
   Ecologic refers to beyond self and the interaction of macro- and
   microsystems with food decisions and behaviours. Food Decisions reflects
   the application of knowledge, information and skills to make food
   choices. These interdependent attributes are depicted in a proposed
   conceptual model.
   Conclusions: The lack of evaluated tools inhibits the ability to assess
   and monitor food literacy; tailor, target and evaluate programmes;
   identify gaps in programming; engage in advocacy; and allocate
   resources. The present scoping review provides the foundation for the
   development of a food literacy measurement tool to address these gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Animal welfare should be prioritized not only for the
   animal's life sustainability but also for supporting the sustainability
   of living organism's life on the earth. However, Indonesian people have
   not understood it yet, thereby still treating animals arbitrarily and
   not appreciating either domesticated or wild animals.
   Aim: This research aimed to analyze the zoo agent's action in applying
   the five freedoms principle for animal welfare in Taman Satwa Taru Jurug
   (thereafter called TSTJ) or Surakarta Zoo and Gembira Loka Zoo (GLZ) of
   Yogyakarta Indonesia using Giddens structuration theory.
   Materials and Methods: The informants in this comparative study with
   explorative were organizers, visitors, and stakeholders of zoos selected
   using purposive sampling technique. The informants consisted of 19
   persons: 8 from TSTJ (Code T) and 10 from GLZ (Code G) and
   representatives from Natural Resource Conservation Center of Central
   Java (Code B). Data were collected through observation, in-depth
   interview, and Focus Group Discussion and Documentation. Data were
   analyzed using an interactive model of analysis consisting of three
   components: Data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing. Data
   validation was carried out using method and data source triangulations.
   Results: Food, nutrition, and nutrition level have been given consistent
   with the animals' habit and natural behavior. Animal keepers always
   maintain their self-cleanliness. GLZ has provided cages according to the
   technical instruction of constructing ideal cages, but the cages in TSTJ
   are worrying as they are not consistent with standard, rusty, and
   damaged, and animals have no partner. Some animals in GLZ are often
   sick, whereas some animals in TSTJ are dead due to poor maintenance. The
   iron pillars of cages restrict animal behavior in TSTJ so that they have
   not had freedom to behave normally yet, whereas, in GLZ, they can move
   freely in original habitat. The animals in the two zoos have not been
   free from disruption, stress, and pressure due to the passing over
   vehicles.
   Conclusion: There should be strategic communication, information, and
   education, community development, and law enforcement for the animal
   welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood malnutrition is a risk factor for mental disorders, such as
   major depression and anxiety. Evidence shows that similar early life
   adversities induce sex-dependent epigenetic reprogramming. However,
   little is known about how genes are specifically affected by early
   malnutrition and the implications for males and females respectively.
   One relevant target is neuropeptide Y (NPY), which regulates both stress
   and food-intake. We studied maternal low protein diet (LPD) during
   pregnancy/lactation in mice. Male, but not female, offspring of LPD
   mothers consistently displayed anxiety-and depression-like behaviors
   under acute stress. Transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of acute
   stress in the amygdala, revealed a list of transcription factors
   affected by either sex or perinatal LPD. Among these immediate early
   genes (IEG), members of the Early growth response family (Egr1/2/4) were
   consistently upregulated by perinatal LPD in both sexes. EGR1 also bound
   the NPY receptor Y1 gene (Npy1r), which co-occurred with sex-specific
   effects of perinatal LPD on both Npy1r DNA-methylation and gene
   transcription. Our proposed pathway connecting early malnutrition,
   sex-independent regulatory changes in Egr1, and sex-specific epigenetic
   reprogramming of its effector gene, Npy1r, represents the first
   molecular evidence of how early life risk factors may generate
   sex-specific epigenetic effects relevant for mental disorders.}},

   Transplantation (ACT) randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Low physical activity and reduced physical functioning are
   common after renal transplantation, resulting in a reduced quality of
   life. Another common post-transplantation complication is poor
   cardio-metabolic health, which plays a main role in long-term outcomes
   in renal transplant recipients (RTR). It is increasingly recognized that
   weight gain in the first year after transplantation, especially an
   increase in fat mass, is a highly common contributor to cardio-metabolic
   risk. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of usual care to
   the effects of exercise alone, and exercise combined with dietary
   counseling, on physical functioning, quality of life and
   post-transplantation weight gain in RTR.
   Methods: The Active Care after Transplantation study is a multicenter
   randomized controlled trial with three arms in which RTR from 3 Dutch
   hospitals are randomized within the first year after transplantation to
   usual care, to exercise intervention (3 months supervised exercise 2
   times per week followed by 12 months active follow-up), or to an
   exercise + diet intervention, consisting of the exercise training with
   additional dietary counseling (12 sessions over 15 months by a renal
   dietician). In total, 219 participants (73 per group) will be recruited.
   The primary outcome is the subdomain physical functioning of quality of
   life, (SF-36 PF). Secondary outcomes include other evaluations of
   quality of life (SF-36, KDQOL-SF, EQ-5D), objective measures of physical
   functioning (aerobic capacity and muscle strength), level of physical
   activity, gain in adiposity (body fat percentage by bio-electrical
   impedance assessment, BMI, waist circumference), and cardiometabolic
   risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, glucose metabolism). Furthermore,
   data on renal function, medical history, medication, psychological
   factors (motivation, kinesiophobia, coping style), nutrition knowledge,
   nutrition intake, nutrition status, fatigue, work participation, process
   evaluation and cost-effectiveness are collected.
   Discussion: Evidence on the effectiveness of an exercise intervention,
   or an exercise + diet intervention on physical functioning, weight gain
   and cardiometabolic health in RTR is currently lacking. The outcomes of
   the present study may help to guide future evidence-based lifestyle care
   after renal transplantation.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have
   clearly shown that disease risk in later life is increased following a
   poor early life environment, a process preferentially termed
   developmental programming. In particular, this work clearly highlights
   the importance of the nutritional environment during early development
   with alterations in maternal nutrition, including both under-and
   overnutrition, increasing the risk for a range of cardiometabolic and
   neurobehavioral disorders in adult offspring characterized by both
   adipokine resistance and obesity. Although the mechanistic basis for
   such developmental programming is not yet fully defined, a common
   feature derived from experimental animal models is that of alterations
   in the wiring of the neuroendocrine pathways that control energy balance
   and appetite regulation during early stages of developmental plasticity.
   The adipokine leptin has also received significant attention with clear
   experimental evidence that normal regulation of leptin levels during the
   early life period is critical for the normal development of tissues and
   related signaling pathways that are involved in metabolic and
   cardiovascular homeostasis. There is also increasing evidence that
   alterations in the epigenome and other underlying mechanisms including
   an altered gut-brain axis may contribute to lasting cardiometabolic
   dysfunction in offspring. Ongoing studies that further define the
   mechanisms between these associations will allow for identification of
   early risk markers and implementation of strategies around interventions
   that will have obvious beneficial implications in breaking a programmed

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{658}},
Pages = {{73-78}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Tests based on hyponeophagia phenomena are the most widely used to check
   the efficacy and efficiency of new-generation chronic antidepressant
   treatments. Even so, these tests lack strict consensus about their
   methodology, which reduces their validity, reproducibility and makes
   translatability difficult. Therefore, after an extensive literature
   review on this subject, we propose a methodological protocol for the
   Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test to normalize this situation. Animals
   were induced to a reserpine-induced depression model and were then
   chronically treated with duloxetine, desvenlafaxine or vehicle. After a
   14-day treatment, a standardized Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test was
   performed. Standardization included three-phase deprivation and the
   introduction of standard highly palatable food. The duloxetine-treated
   and desvenlafaxine-treated animals exhibited behavioral improvement of
   depressive-like symptoms. They took less time to eat from the center of
   the open-field, and approached food more times per minute than the
   vehicle-treated animals. This normalization proposal proves effective in

Title = {{The association of addictive-like eating with food intake in children}},
Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The potential role of an addictive process in problematic
   eating is a growing area of interest and debate. Children are more
   vulnerable to the negative effects of addictive substances than adults
   and may be at increased risk for addictive-like eating behavior. No
   prior study has evaluated the association of addictive-like eating with
   objectively measured eating behavior in adults or children. We examined
   the association between ``food addiction{''} and observed food
   consumption among children and whether age moderated this association.
   Method: Seventy children participated in an observed dinner meal,
   completed a dietary recall interview, and answered the Yale Food
   Addiction Scale for Children (YFAS-C), a questionnaire assessing
   symptoms of ``food addiction{''}. Children's total calories ordered,
   calories consumed at dinner, calories consumed post-dinner, and a total
   of calories consumed at dinner and post-dinner were calculated along
   with their BMI percentile. We used generalized estimated equation models
   to investigate the relationship between the YFAS-C and food consumption.
   Results: Elevated ``food addiction{''} symptoms, but not BMI percentile,
   were positively associated with an increased amount of calories consumed
   at dinner and post-dinner. Age significantly moderated the relationship
   between YFAS-C and caloric intake, with only younger children exhibiting
   this association.
   Conclusions: As the first study of objectively measured eating behavior,
   we found addictive-like eating scores in children were positively
   associated with the total amount of calories consumed. Among younger
   children, ``food addiction{''} was more strongly asociated with the
   total calories consumed than BMI percentile, highlighting the importance
   of assessing behavioral phenotypes when evaluating caloric intake. This
   association between addictive-like eating and caloric intake among
   younger, but not older children may be due to differences in inhibitory
   control and dietary restraint. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) have invaded benthic habitats of
   the Laurentian Great Lakes and connected tributary streams. Although
   connected, these two systems generally differ in temperature (Great
   Lakes are typically colder), food availability (Dreissenid mussels are
   more prevalent in Great Lakes), and system size and openness. Here, we
   compare round goby life histories from inshore Lake Michigan and
   adjacent tributary systemsan uncommon case study of life-history
   differences between connected systems. Tributary round gobies grew much
   faster (average length-at-age of 122.3 vs. 65.7mm for Age 2+ round
   gobies), appeared to have shorter life spans (maximum observed age of 2
   vs. 5) and had lower age-at-50\% maturity (1.6 vs. 2.4years; females
   only) compared to gobies from Lake Michigan. In addition, tributary
   gobies had greater fecundity at Ages 1-2 than lake gobies, but had fewer
   eggs for a given body size prior to the first spawning event of the
   summer. We were not able to determine the cause of the observed
   life-history differences. Nonetheless, the observed differences in
   growth, maturation and longevity were consistent with known effects of
   water temperature, as well as predictions of life-history theory for

Abstract = {{1. The swallowtail butterfly Battus polydamas archidamas Boisduval,
   1936, exhibits polyphenism for pupal coloration (green and brown). It is
   distributed across arid regions with winter rains and is monophagous on
   Aristolochia plants, which emerge after the winter rains and dry out the
   during summer. Thus, day length does not covary positively with host
   plant productivity. It was hypothesised that pupal colour was driven by
   food availability, not photoperiod. The benefits of pupal coloration
   matching the colour of pupation sites in terms of field survival were
   also investigated to evaluate the adaptive value of pupa colour.
   2. Larvae were reared under a factorial array of two photoperiods (LD
   10: 14 h and LD 14: 10 h) and two food availability regimes (leaves ad
   libitum and available every other day) to assess the frequency of green
   and brown pupae. Field survival of green and brown pupae was quantified
   in three commonly used habitats that differ in background coloration
   (cacti, rocks and shrubs).
   3. Food availability determined pupal colour. Larvae in the ad libitum
   regime resulted mostly in green pupae, while those with restricted food
   were mostly brown. In contrast, photoperiod did not influence pupal
   colour. Survival probability of pupae placed on cacti was higher than
   those placed on rocks and shrubs, and the lowest predation risk across
   habitats was for green pupae on cacti.

   pupal colour of specialist butterflies inhabiting arid environments with

Abstract = {{Lifestyle intervention can be effective when treating non-alcoholic
   fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. Weight loss decreases
   cardiovascular and diabetes risk and can also regress liver disease.
   Weight reductions of >= 10\% can induce a near universal non-alcoholic
   steatohepatitis resolution and fibrosis improvement by at least one
   stage. However, modest weight loss (>5\%) can also produce important
   benefits on the components of the NAFLD activity score (NAS).
   Additionally, we need to explore the role of total calories and type of
   weight loss diet, micro-and macronutrients, evidence-based benefits of
   physical activity and exercise and finally support these modifications
   through established behavioural change models and techniques for
   long-term maintenance of lifestyle modifications.
   Following a Mediterranean diet can reduce liver fat even without weight
   loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD. The
   Mediterranean diet is characterised by reduced carbohydrate intake,
   especially sugars and refined carbohydrates (40\% of the calories vs.
   5060\% in a typical low fat diet), and increased monounsaturated and
   omega-3 fatty acid intake (40\% of the calories as fat vs. up-to 30\% in
   a typical low fat diet). Both TV sitting (a reliable marker of overall
   sedentary behaviour) and physical activity are associated with
   cardiometabolic health, NAFLD and overall mortality. A `triple hit
   behavioural phenotype' of: i) sedentary behaviour, ii) low physical
   activity, and iii) poor diet have been defined. Clinical evidence
   strongly supports the role of lifestyle modification as a primary
   therapy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. This should be accompanied
   by the implementation of strategies to avoid relapse and weight regain.

Abstract = {{Parent birds show a continuous spectrum of breeding strategies, ranging
   from a low-fecundity and high-survival pattern to a high-fecundity,
   low-survival pattern. Investigations of parental breeding strategies
   under variable environmental conditions can illustrate how parents
   trade-off the benefits and costs of these two extreme strategies.
   White-collared Blackbirds Turdus albocinctus can breed twice a year on
   the Tibetan Plateau. We show that both life-history traits and parental
   feeding behaviour differ between these two breeding attempts. In the
   first attempt, the birds produced small clutches and fledged a small
   number of nestlings of high body condition. In the second attempt, they
   produced larger clutches and fledged more nestlings of lower body
   condition. Males made greater contributions to brood provisioning
   compared with females in the first attempt but there was no sex
   difference in brood provisioning in the second attempt. In the first
   attempt, producing smaller clutches can shorten the nestling period, and
   the increased male contribution to brood provisioning can protect the
   energy reserves of females. Thus, females can begin a second attempt
   sooner and produce larger clutches. During the second nesting attempt,
   when conditions are warmer and wetter, parents rely on a broader array
   of food types (both invertebrates and plant material, primarily berries)
   than during the first attempt, which includes only animal food such as
   arthropods and annelids. We suggest that this difference in breeding
   strategies between nesting attempts and sexes is in part influenced by
   marked seasonal variation in food availability.}},

Abstract = {{In animal societies, behavioral idiosyncrasies of the individuals often
   guide which tasks they should perform. Such personality-specific task
   participation can increase individual task efficiency, thereby improving
   group performance. While several recent studies have documented
   group-level benefits of within-group behavioral (i.e., personality)
   diversity, how these benefits are realized at the individual level is
   unclear. Here we probe the individual-level benefits of
   personality-driven task participation in the social spider Stegodyphus
   dumicola. In S. dumicola, the presence of at least one highly bold
   individual catalyzes foraging behavior in shy colony members, and all
   group constituents heavily compete for prey. We assessed boldness by
   examining how quickly spiders resumed normal movement after a simulated
   predator attack. We test here whether (1) participants in collective
   foraging gain more mass from prey items and (2) whether bold individuals
   are less resistant to starvation than shy spiders, which would motivate
   the bold individuals to forage more. Next, we assembled colonies of shy
   spiders with and without a bold individual, added one prey item, and
   then tracked the mass gain of each individual spider after this single
   feeding event. We found that spiders that participated in prey capture
   (whether bold or shy) gained more mass than nonparticipators, and
   colonies containing a single bold spider gained more total mass than
   purely shy colonies. We also found that bold spiders participated in
   more collective foraging events and were more susceptible to starvation
   than shy spiders, suggesting that the aggressive foraging of bold
   individuals may represent a strategy to offset starvation risk. These
   findings add to the body of evidence that animal personality can shape
   social organization, individual performance, and group success.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-predator responses in animals are dynamic and depend on multiple
   factors. However, most of our understanding about animal escape
   responses comes from studies which examine only a small set of factors
   at a time and are done over a short period of animal life spans. This
   limits our understanding of the dynamic nature of animal escape
   behaviour and the relative importance of individual factors in
   determining their escape behaviour. We used a repeated-measures study
   design to assess the anti-predator response of a wild population of a
   sexually dimorphic tropical lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis. We followed
   marked individuals throughout their breeding lifespan, repeatedly
   assayed their escape response and measured representative intrinsic and
   extrinsic factors that could modulate their escape response. Our
   findings suggest that intrinsic factors, such as sex and body size,
   influenced escape response relatively more than extrinsic factors did,
   such as distance to refuge and perch height. Although individual
   variables influenced escape behaviour, in a direction mostly consistent
   with predictions from optimal escape theory, the interaction between
   factors led to novel insights into how animals dynamically evaluate
   multiple and changing costs throughout their lifetime to evade
   predation.
   Significance statement
   Fleeing from a potential predator is crucial to animals and depends on
   different factors, as there are various costs to escaping. Although
   several studies in the past have evaluated the role of various factors
   in determining escape response, the relative importance of factors and
   how it changes across the lifetime of individuals are not clear. By
   assessing individuals repeatedly over a substantial part of their
   lifespan, we could gain insight into how escape response changes as
   associated factors, intrinsic or extrinsic, change for an individual
   over time. This approach provided us a more robust and accurate
   representation of the dynamic nature of escape decisions. We also
   demonstrate that when multiple factors are considered simultaneously,
   their relative importance in determining timing of escape can
   considerably differ from theoretical predictions.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This study's objective was to determine whether two distinct
   carbohydrate (CHO)-modified diets and a standard portion-controlled (PC)
   diet differentially impacted children's eating behaviors and whether
   eating behavior scores predicted lower BMI among children with obesity.
   Methods: Children (n=102) aged 7-12 years with obesity were randomly
   assigned to a 12-month intervention of a low-carbohydrate (LC), reduced
   glycemic load (RGL), or standard PC diet. The Three-Factor Eating
   Questionnaire (TFEQ) was completed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months by
   parents to characterize their child's hunger (H), disinhibition (D), and
   cognitive restraint (CR). Baseline and follow-up TFEQ scores by diet
   were evaluated relative to BMI status over time.
   Results: All diet groups showed increased CR and decreased H and D from
   baseline to 3 months, with differences from baseline remaining at 12
   months for CR and H. Lower BMI status during study follow-up was
   associated with different TFEQ scores by diet group (LC and RGL: higher
   CR; PC: lower H), adjusting for sex, age, and race. Higher CR at
   follow-up was predicted by race and higher baseline CR; only lower H at
   baseline predicted lower H at follow-up.
   Conclusion: Eating behaviors improved significantly with all diets
   during the initial 3 months; higher CR and lower H were sustained at
   treatment's end. BMI outcomes were associated with different eating
   behaviors in CHO-modified diet groups compared with PC diets. Targeting
   diets of children with obesity with specific baseline characteristics
   may lead to improved outcomes.}},

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Owing to trade-offs between investment in current and future
   reproduction, factors that diminish a parent's survival prospects, such
   as predation threat, are expected to increase investment in existing
   young. Nevertheless, effects of predation risk on parental investment
   have only rarely been examined, and not at all within the context of
   filial cannibalism ( parental consumption of their own offspring). We
   examined filial cannibalism and nest characteristics in a small fish
   with paternal egg care, the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, both when
   exposed to a common piscivore, the perch, Perca fluviatilis, and in the
   absence of predators. We found that when males consumed only some of
   their eggs ( partial filial cannibalism), the number of eaten eggs did
   not depend on predation threat, possibly indicating that partial clutch
   consumption is largely motivated by benefits to existing young. Total
   filial cannibalism ( whole clutch consumption) was marginally less
   common under predator exposure, while its strongest predictor was small
   clutch size. This suggests that the return on parental investment has a
   greater influence on total filial cannibalism than the likelihood of
   future breeding. Regarding nest architecture, males that consumed their
   entire brood after exposure to a predator built larger nest entrances,
   possibly to facilitate predator evasion. Males that cared for at least
   part of their brood, however, maintained small nest entrances regardless
   of predation threat. Furthermore, more elaborate nests were not
   associated with greater egg consumption, suggesting that filial
   cannibalism is not employed to sustain nest building. (C) 2017 The

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{8-14}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Motivation to explore is believed to be widespread among animals, but
   exploratory behaviour varies within populations. Offering variety in
   feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to
   express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals' exploration of
   different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a
   balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested
   the degree to which Holstein heifers (n = 10) preferred variety in feed
   vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying
   types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also
   investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by
   measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in
   preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was
   evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and
   novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the
   constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20\% of their time at
   varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0
   to 46\% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0-93\% in the flavour
   trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake
   of novel feed as calves (r(s) = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied
   flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel
   object (r(s) = -0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and
   exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits.
   These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule
   as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of
   enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd.}},

   individual differences in risk aversion and island tameness. In addition
   to testing for temporal, spatial, and sex effects on FID, we compared
   repeatability estimates at two temporal scales (within and among days).
   Similar FID for measurements obtained on the same day and for males and
   females indicated an absence of short-term desensitization and sex
   effects. In contrast, FID decreased for measurements made on subsequent
   days and from east to west, which could reflect habituation to human
   presence and (or) other temporal and spatial processes. Repeatability
   was high (0.42 +/- 0.06), but tended to decrease with increasing time

   lower activity, which in turn affects energy expenditure that is used
   for development and growth. It is therefore necessary to study how
   behavior interacts with changes in body shape with regard to resource
   density and predators. Here, we use the classic predator-induced
   morphological defense in fish to study the interaction between predator
   cues, resource availability, and behavioral activity with the aim to
   determine their relative contribution to changes in body shape. We show
   that all three variables, the presence of a predator, food level, and
   activity, both additively and interactively, affected the body shape of
   perch. In general, the presence of predators, lower swimming activity,
   and higher food levels induced a deep body shape, with predation and
   behavior having similar effect and food treatment the smallest effect.
   The shape changes seemed to be mediated by changes in growth rate as
   body condition showed a similar effect as shape with regard to
   food-level and predator treatments. Our results suggests that shape
   changes in animals to one environmental factor, for example, predation
   risk, can be context dependent, and depend on food levels or behavioral
   responses. Theoretical and empirical studies should further explore how
   this context dependence affects fitness components such as resource gain
   and mortality and their implications for population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal malnutrition significantly increases offspring risk for both
   metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders. Animal models of maternal
   malnutrition have identified behavioral changes in the adult offspring
   related to executive function and reward processing. Together, these
   changes in executive and reward-based behaviors likely contribute to the
   etiology of both metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders associated
   with maternal malnutrition. Concomitant with the behavioral effects,
   maternal malnutrition alters offspring expression of reward-related
   molecules and inflammatory signals in brain pathways that control
   executive function and reward. Neuroimmune pathways and microglial
   interactions in these specific brain circuits, either in early
   development or later in adulthood, could directly contribute to the
   maternal malnutrition-induced behavioral phenotypes. Understanding these
   mechanisms will help advance treatment strategies for metabolic and

Title = {{Prevalence of Exercise Addiction Symptomology and Disordered Eating in
   Australian Students Studying Nutrition and Dietetics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS}},

Abstract = {{Background Previous research has reported the existence of disordered
   eating in students studying nutrition and dietetics. However, the
   occurrence of exercise addiction, previously linked to disordered
   eating, is poorly understood in this group.
   Objective The main objective of this study was to explore the prevalence
   of self reported symptoms of exercise addiction and the association with
   disordered eating in a sample of students studying nutrition and
   dietetics. A secondary objective was to compare the prevalence of
   exercise addiction to students enrolled in another health related
   degree.
   Design We conducted a cross-sectional study in 165 undergraduate
   students.
   Participants/setting Participants were students of both sexes enrolled
   in nutrition and dietetics and occupational therapy degree programs at
   an Australian university in August 2013.
   Main outcome measures Participants completed four validated
   questionnaires for assessment of exercise- and eating-related attitudes
   and behaviors measuring scores for exercise addiction, weekly volume of
   physical activity (PA), eating disorder symptoms, and cognitive
   restraint. Stretch stature and body mass were measured and body
   composition was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.
   Statistical analyses performed Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test,
   and X.2 test were completed to compare groups of students based on sex,
   degree, or eating attitudes. Spearman's correlation was performed to
   explore associations between continuous variables (exercise addiction
   scores, PA volume, and scores for eating attitudes and cognitive
   restraint).
   Results Approximately 23\% of nutrition and dietetics students were
   found to be at risk of exercise addiction (20\% females and 35\% males;
   P=0.205), while the majority demonstrated some symptoms of exercise
   addiction. A similar proportion of at risk individuals was found in the
   female occupational therapy group (19\%; P=1.000). In females (nutrition
   and dietetics and occupational therapy combined), the exercise addiction
   scores were associated with three other outcome measures: PA volume
   (r(s)=0.41; P<0.001), eating attitudes scores (r(s)=0.24; P=0.008), and
   cognitive restraint (r(s)=0.32; P<0.001). Comparative analysis indicated
   that female students with high cognitive restraint had greater exercise
   addiction scores than those with low cognitive restraint (20.3 {[}4.8]
   compared to 17.8 {[}4.2]; P=0.003).
   Conclusions Results suggest high prevalence of exercise addiction in
   this sample of undergraduate health-related degree students and its link
   to amount of PA and disordered eating in females. Future research should
   include larger samples of both sexes to build the existing understanding
   on these maladaptive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The positive effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on social behavior have
   been recently reported in patients and rodent models of autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Given the beneficial effects of the KD on epilepsy,
   mitochondrial function, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammation,
   treatment based on the ED has the potential to reduce some of the
   ASD-associated symptoms, including abnormal social interactions. It is
   not known whether the ED influences sociability by reducing the
   pathological processes underlying ASD or through some independent
   mechanism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of
   the KD on the social behavior of rats.
   Four-week-old Long-Evans males were treated with the KD for 4 subsequent
   weeks. Afterwards, behavioral tests were performed in order to evaluate
   sociability, locomotor activity, working memory, and anxiety-related
   behaviors. Additionally we performed the social interaction test in
   animals that were receiving beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetone. We have
   observed that rats fed with the KD showed increased social exploration
   in three different experimental settings. We did not observe any changes
   in the level of social interactions in animals treated with exogenous
   ketone bodies. The results did not show any difference in mobility or
   anxiety-related behaviors or working memory between the animals fed with
   the KD or standard rodent chow. In conclusion, we showed that the KD
   affects the social behavior of wild-type young adult male rats, which
   was not associated with other behavioral changes.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical detection of predation risk is direct when based on
   predator odors, or indirect when an injured conspecific or
   heterospecific signal it. Physiological adjustments may be necessary in
   parallel to defensive reactions to cope with an imminent risk. Here, we
   tested the effects of predator odors and conspecific chemical alarm cues
   in ventilation response (VR) of frillfin goby, Bathygobius soporator,
   because this response increases oxygen uptake for supporting behavioral
   tasks. No VR change was detected in response to odors of predators
   (catfish) that fed on conspecific, heterospecific fish (tilapia), or
   were deprived of food and to non-predator (tilapia) that fed chow
   (non-specific odor control) and odor eluent. The goby's VR, however,
   increased in response to conspecific alarm cues, but not to
   heterospecific cues or eluent. Clearly, the VR response in fish depends
   on the nature of the chemical cue. It is in line with `threat-sensitive
   hypothesis' as a chemical cue from an injured prey might mean a foraging
   predator, whilst the mere presence of a predator odor might not. In
   addition, because VR can increase, decrease or remains unchanged in
   response to predation risk in other fish species (including other
   gobies), we reinforces the species-specific chracteristic of VR
   responses in fish, regarding the results obtained here for frillfin
   gobies.}},

Abstract = {{Given that approximately two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,
   there is substantial interest in dieting (dietary restraint) to promote
   weight loss. However, research on the associations between dietary
   restraint and binge eating is inconsistent. One possible explanation for
   contradictory findings is that measures of dietary restraint assess
   heterogeneous constructs. Nonclinical samples of university student (n =
   433; 62.6\% female) and community-recruited (n = 407; 47.4\% female)
   adults completed self-report measures of dietary restraint. Exploratory
   structural equation modeling and exploratory and confirmatory factor
   analyses were used to identify latent dietary restraint factor(s).
   Structural equation modeling and multiple regression were used to test
   associations among latent dietary restraint factor(s), body mass index
   (BMI), eating-disorder risk, binge eating, and psychopathological and
   personality variables. Three latent dietary restraint factors emerged:
   (a) Calorie Counting; (b) Preoccupation With Dieting; and (c)
   Weight-Focused Restraint. The model demonstrated a good fit to the data.
   Eating-disorder risk was significantly and positively associated with
   all restraint factors, whereas higher levels of BMI and binge eating
   were significantly associated with greater Preoccupation with Dieting
   and Weight-Focused Restraint only. Our findings indicated that dietary
   restraint is a heterogeneous construct and that measures of restraint
   assess different aspects of dieting. Our results have important
   implications for eating and weight disorders treatment, and suggest that
   weight-loss interventions that do not simultaneously increase negative
   attitudes toward one's body may be useful for treating weight disorders,
   without promoting disordered eating.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical organisms are predicted to be among the most impacted by
   increasing sea surface temperatures, particularly those from intertidal
   habitats. In this study, a complete thermal biology assessment was
   conducted for two widespread tropical Atlantic shallow reef fish:
   Abudefduf saxatilis (damselfish) and Scartella cristata (blenny), which
   make extensive use of tide pools. The main objectives were to measure
   the time-course changes during one month in i) thermal and oxidative
   stress biomarkers (in gills, muscle and skin), ii) upper thermal limits,
   acclimation capacity and thermal safety margins and iii) body size,
   condition and energy reserves (total protein and lipid contents), under
   two temperature treatments (control - mean summer temperature, and
   elevated temperature - + 3 degrees C, as projected by climate warming
   scenarios for the end of this century).
   Results from biomarker analyses suggest that under increased
   temperature, both species displayed a typical response of physiological
   stress characterized by the activation of molecular chaperones and
   antioxidant protection. Both species presented a significant acclimation
   potential in the long term, as shown by increased critical thermal
   maxima values at higher temperature. However, these species may already
   be at risk during summer heat waves, as thermal safety margins for both
   species were low. Additionally, despite acclimation, some energetic
   tradeoffs may exist, since specimens from both species showed smaller
   body sizes at higher temperature (even though maintaining body
   condition). Finally, temperature treatments had a significant influence
   not only in the total amount of energy reserves (lipid contents) but
   also in their rate of deposition or depletion (total proteins and lipid
   contents). This is the first multi-end-point holistic approach to assess
   the impact of warming in shallow tropical water fish and it highlights
   the high risk that intertidal organisms are facing in both present and
   future sea surface temperature conditions.}},
