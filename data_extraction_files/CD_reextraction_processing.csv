10e25 test spiders per family from 28 families. Between 1600 and 2000 hours, I allowed test spiders to crawl from their rearing cups on to the edge of the residents web. Preliminary tests suggested that resident spiders and test spiders were often unaware of each others presence: test spiders often crawled slowly onto the web and then remained motionless (as is normal in the field; Jakob et al. 2000). To alert the spiders to each others presence, I touched a ringing tuning fork to the web approximately 2 cm from the test spider, 3e5 min after its introduction into the web. Holocnemus pluchei treats these vibrations as struggling prey (Jakob 1991). Generally, one or both spiders ran towards the tuning fork. The following day, I scored the location of the test
spider, usually in the morning. In preliminary trials (N ¼ 20), locations were stable for 3 days. I scored them as either remaining in a group with the resident spider or building a separate web. When silk was difficult to see, I touched a ringing tuning fork to the web next to the test spider, and if the resident spider oriented to or approached it, I scored spiders as remaining. I discarded trials if the resident spider was not on its web. In trials with no resident spider, I used the same protocol

This range in food provisioned represented a resource-poor to resource-rich range in food availability and was finalized based on preliminary experiments which monitored larval development and survival under a wide range of food concentration conditions..... Time to pupation decreased and survival probability and pupal weights increased with increasing food concentrations, indicating that resource depletion and competition acted in the range of food concentrations tested.

The lighter background was presumed to represent a habitat of higher risk than the darker background because mosquito larvae are detected more easily by predators against a lighter background and some studies have shown that mosquito larvae avoid lighter, more open habitats (Foley et al., 2002). Our two assay environments differed in the level of contrast between the two halves. In the stark-contrast assay environment, representing a large difference in risk between the two habitats, the high-risk half of the plate had only 50 (1.57 per cm2) randomly placed dots (each 0.18 mm in diameter) and the low-risk half had a very dark background with 10 000 randomly placed points (314.25 per cm2).

Spatial positions of the fish were tabulated by dividing the tank into 16 blocks (4 vertical columns and 4 horizontal rows) and notlng the location of each fish every minute over a 10 min period. Indices of general motor activity were calculated by following the movements of a single fish and counting the number of times it moved from one block to another over a 5 min period. Activity ambit, the area of movement by an individual moving through the tank, was derived as the total number of different blocks that a fish entered during the 5 min activity observation. Ambit values could range from 3 (the fish remained in the same block for 5 min) to 16 (the fish visited each block in the tank at least once during 5 min). Activity levels and activity ambits of 2 individuals were measured in conjunction with each 10 min set of fish location data. Activity scores and spatial positions were measured during both isothermal and stratified conditions. For Expts 1 and 2, pollock behavior was monitored for 4 d. A group was added to the tank on the morning of Day 1 and allowed 3 or 4 h of acclirnation prior to observations. The first 2 days were isothermal. On the morning of the 3rd day, a thermocline was set up in the tank, and fish were observed for an additional 2 d under stratified conditions. Water temperatures during isothermal conditions were maintained between 8.5 and 9.5""C. In stratified treatments, average water temperatures were 8.5""C in the upper layer and 2.0°C in the lower layer. The thermocline was positioned at slightly below the mid-point of the tank, with the full thermal transition extending across approximately 30 cm.

Spatial positions of the fish were tabulated by dividing the tank into 16 blocks (4 vertical columns and 4 horizontal rows) and notlng the location of each fish every minute over a 10 min period. Indices of general motor activity were calculated by following the movements of a single fish and counting the number of times it moved from one block to another over a 5 min period. Activity ambit, the area of movement by an individual moving through the tank, was derived as the total number of different blocks that a fish entered during the 5 min activity observation. Ambit values could range from 3 (the fish remained in the same block for 5 min) to 16 (the fish visited each block in the tank at least once during 5 min). Activity levels and activity ambits of 2 individuals were measured in conjunction with each 10 min set of fish location data. Activity scores and spatial positions were measured during both isothermal and stratified conditions. For Expts 1 and 2, pollock behavior was monitored for 4 d. A group was added to the tank on the morning of Day 1 and allowed 3 or 4 h of acclirnation prior to observations. The first 2 days were isothermal. On the morning of the 3rd day, a thermocline was set up in the tank, and fish were observed for an additional 2 d under stratified conditions. Water temperatures during isothermal conditions were maintained between 8.5 and 9.5""C. In stratified treatments, average water temperatures were 8.5""C in the upper layer and 2.0°C in the lower layer. The thermocline was positioned at slightly below the mid-point of the tank, with the full thermal transition extending across approximately 30 cm. When the water column in the tank was stratified, we measured the duration in seconds of each excursion (dive) by a fish Into th.e cold water beneath the thermocl~ne during a 10 min period. The percentage of time spent in cold water was calculated by summing these dive durations and dividing by 3000 s (the maximum amount possible for 5 fish combined during 10 min). Because individuals could not be recognized, it was not possible to determine the dive history for each fish separ","4","6.835051546","0.587628866","0.293814433",NA,"3","7.948453608","1.821331777","1.051546392",NA,"","","","","positive","no","Figure 7b","figure","","","0% x 54 day group, condition was reduced in all restricted groups and only 10% group showed growth so this group was taken as the control"

First, we measured freeze time, which is the duration of time between a crickets exposure to the novel environment (i.e., the raising of the cup) and any motion by a cricket (e.g., walking, antennal movement, or grooming). Freezing is a stereotypic antidetection response associated with predation avoidance across taxa (Chelini et al. 2009; reviewed in Stynoski and Noble 2012). Second, we measured the number of times each cricket entered/exited a covered arm (covered arm exploration). Crickets should seek the arenas covered arms to reduce their risk of predationthus, individuals that entered and exited multiple covered arms were presumably bolder (less risk averse) than those that simply stayed within a single covered arm during the 10-min trial period. Third, we measured the proportion of time each cricket spent locomoting (locomotion) as a proxy for behavioral activity. After each trial, we cleaned the arena with 70% ethanol and returned each cricket to its individual container. We weighed each cricket between 14:00 and 15:00 before OS trials (see below).","28","","","",NA,"29","","","",NA,"MannWhitney U test","277","","0.039","positive","no","Text, pp225","text","exclude_all","insufficient data available",""

Briefly, the behaviour of each fish was assessed by a scuba
diver positioned approximately 1 m away from the patch. A
magnifying glass (4 ) aided the assessment of bite rates and

each fish. Four aspects of activity and behaviour were assessed:
