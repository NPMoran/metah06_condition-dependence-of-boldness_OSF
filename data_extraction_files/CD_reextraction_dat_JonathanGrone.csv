into a labelled plastic bag containing sea water and photographed
against a 1 cm grid for the measurement of body
size. Fish were then released onto individual patch reefs
(25   20   15 cm) positioned 3 m from the reef edge (2 m
apart) within 2 h of conditioning. Patch reefs were composed
of a combination of live and dead Pocillopora damicornis, a
bushy hard coral. A fine mesh cage was placed over the
patch reef for 4060 min to prevent predation during
acclimation to their new habitat.
(c) Behavioural assessment
Following acclimation, the behaviour of fish was quantified for
3 min following previously developed protocols [17,28,33,34].
Briefly, the behaviour of each fish was assessed by a scuba
diver positioned approximately 1 m away from the patch. A
magnifying glass (4 ) aided the assessment of bite rates and
space use over the 3 min focal animal sampling period for
each fish. Four aspects of activity and behaviour were assessed:
(i) bite rate; (ii) total distance moved (cm); (iii) maximum
distance ventured from the habitat patch (cm); and (iv) boldness
(recorded as a variable on a continuous scale from 0 to 3,
where 0 was hiding in hole and seldom emerging; 1 was
retreating to a hole when scared and taking more than 5 s to
re-emerge, weakly or tentatively striking at food; 2 was
shying to shelter when scared but quickly emerging, with purposeful
strikes at food; and 3 was not hiding when scared,
exploring around the coral patch and striking aggressively at
food). At the end of the 3 min observation period, the fish
were approached with a pencil, and the fishs reaction and
latency to emerge from shelter was taken into account in the
assessment of boldness. This measure of boldness has been
found to be repeatable between observers, consistent in the
short term for newly settled damselfish and related to survival
in the field ([17]; M. I. McCormick 2009, unpublished data).",102,39.55704,19.72827195,1.95339,NA,104,33.98718,19.74012999,1.935679,NA,,,,,,"I cannot figure out, where the data comes from",positive,no,"Lonnstedt, O.; McCormick, M.

The lighter background was presumed to represent a habitat of higher risk than the darker background because mosquito larvae are detected more easily by predators against a lighter background and some studies have shown that mosquito larvae avoid lighter, more open habitats (Foley et al., 2002). Our two assay environments differed in the level of contrast between the two halves. In the stark-contrast assay environment, representing a large difference in risk between the two habitats, the high-risk half of the plate had only 50 (1.57 per cm2) randomly placed dots (each 0.18 mm in diameter) and the low-risk half had a very dark background with 10 000 randomly placed points (314.25 per cm2). In the mildcontrast assay environment, on the other hand, the lighter, highrisk habitat had 500 points (15.71 per cm2) and the darker, lowrisk one 5000 points (157.13 per cm2; Fig. 1).

(c) Behavioural assessment
Following acclimation, the behaviour of fish was quantified for
3 min following previously developed protocols [17,28,33,34].
Briefly, the behaviour of each fish was assessed by a scuba
diver positioned approximately 1 m away from the patch. A
magnifying glass (4 ) aided the assessment of bite rates and
space use over the 3 min focal animal sampling period for
each fish. Four aspects of activity and behaviour were assessed:
(i) bite rate; (ii) total distance moved (cm); (iii) maximum
distance ventured from the habitat patch (cm); and (iv) boldness
(recorded as a variable on a continuous scale from 0 to 3,
where 0 was hiding in hole and seldom emerging; 1 was
retreating to a hole when scared and taking more than 5 s to
re-emerge, weakly or tentatively striking at food; 2 was
shying to shelter when scared but quickly emerging, with purposeful
strikes at food; and 3 was not hiding when scared,
exploring around the coral patch and striking aggressively at
food). At the end of the 3 min observation period, the fish
were approached with a pencil, and the fishs reaction and
latency to emerge from shelter was taken into account in the
assessment of boldness. This measure of boldness has been
found to be repeatable between observers, consistent in the
short term for newly settled damselfish and related to survival
in the field ([17]; M. I. McCormick 2009, unpublished data).",101,2.211931,0.686979348,0.068357,NA,103,1.936305,0.687851275,0.067776,NA,,,,,,,positive,no,"Lonnstedt, O.; McCormick, M. (2018).

(c) Behavioural assessment
Following acclimation, the behaviour of fish was quantified for
3 min following previously developed protocols [17,28,33,34].
Briefly, the behaviour of each fish was assessed by a scuba
diver positioned approximately 1 m away from the patch. A
magnifying glass (4 ) aided the assessment of bite rates and
space use over the 3 min focal animal sampling period for
each fish. Four aspects of activity and behaviour were assessed:
(i) bite rate; (ii) total distance moved (cm); (iii) maximum
distance ventured from the habitat patch (cm); and (iv) boldness
(recorded as a variable on a continuous scale from 0 to 3,
where 0 was hiding in hole and seldom emerging; 1 was
retreating to a hole when scared and taking more than 5 s to
re-emerge, weakly or tentatively striking at food; 2 was
shying to shelter when scared but quickly emerging, with purposeful
strikes at food; and 3 was not hiding when scared,
exploring around the coral patch and striking aggressively at
food). At the end of the 3 min observation period, the fish
were approached with a pencil, and the fishs reaction and
latency to emerge from shelter was taken into account in the
assessment of boldness. This measure of boldness has been
found to be repeatable between observers, consistent in the
short term for newly settled damselfish and related to survival
in the field ([17]; M. I. McCormick 2009, unpublished data).",102,21.78431,12.69743089,1.257233,NA,103,16.12621,12.69743047,1.251115,NA,,,,,,,positive,no,"Lonnstedt, O.; McCormick, M. (2018).

The water was changed two days prior to testing. Treatments were randomly assigned, and each salamander was tested only once. At the start of each trial, 60 ml of the appropriate chemical stimulus was added to the center of the chamber via a syringe at the rate of approximately 1 ml/sec. After 5 min, one blackworm was added to the center of the container with a pipet. At this point in the trials, salamanders always were located at the edges of the testing chambers; the distance between the salamander and the worm was 4.55.5 cm. Latency to strike (time from the addition of the worm to the first strike) and handling time (time from the strike until the entire body of the worm was inside the mouth) was recorded for each individual.
