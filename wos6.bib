Title = {{New biomarkers of post-settlement growth in the sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus purpuratus}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Some sea urchins, including the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
   purpuratus, have been successfully used in aquaculture, but their slow
   growth and late reproduction are challenging to overcome when developing
   efficient aquaculture production techniques. S. purpuratus develops via
   an indirect life history that is characterized by a drastic settlement
   process at the end of a larval period that lasts for several weeks.
   During this transition, the bilateral larva is transformed into a
   pentaradial juvenile, which will start feeding and growing in the
   benthic habitat. Due to predation and other ecological factors,
   settlement is typically associated with high mortality rates in juvenile
   populations. Additionally, juveniles require several days to develop a
   functional mouth and digestive system. During this perimetamorphic
   period, juveniles use up larval resources until they are capable to
   digest adult food. Mechanisms underlying the onset of juvenile feeding
   and metabolism have implications for the recruitment of natural
   populations as well as aquaculture and are relatively poorly understood
   in S. purpuratus. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling
   (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway (IIS/TOR) is well conserved
   among animal phyla and regulates physiological and developmental
   functions, such as growth, reproduction, aging and nutritional status.
   We analyzed the expression of FoxO, TOR, and ILPs in post-settlement
   juveniles in conjunction with their early growth trajectories. We also
   tested how pre-settlement starvation affected post-settlement expression
   of IIS. We found that FoxO provides a useful molecular marker in early
   juveniles as its expression is strongly correlated with juvenile growth.
   We also found that pre-settlement starvation affects juvenile growth
   trajectories as well as IIS. Our findings provide preliminary insights
   into the mechanisms underlying post-settlement growth and metabolism in
   S. purpuratus. They also have important implications for sea urchin
   aquaculture, as they show that pre-settlement nutrient environment
   significantly affects both early growth trajectories and gene
   expression. This information can be used to develop new biomarkers for
   juvenile health in sea urchin population ecology and aquaculture

Title = {{Effects of prolonged immunocontraception on the breeding behavior of
   American bison}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1272-1287}},

Abstract = {{In late 2009, the Catalina Island Conservancy began using fertility
   control to replace periodic removals to manage an introduced population
   of American bison (Bison bison) on the island. Through the application
   of the immunocontraceptive vaccine porcine zona pellucida (PZP),
   population growth was slowed within 1 year, and halted over time. In
   response to lingering questions about the use of PZP to manage large,
   free-ranging wildlife populations, we sought to determine the
   reversibility of PZP by ceasing the annual application to a subset of 15
   bison cows and monitoring for subsequent calf arrival, and to document
   changes in the timing and length of the breeding season in response to
   PZP by monitoring breeding behavior and assessing fecal progesterone
   (FP) levels for all 60 resident cows over a 13-month period. As of June
   2017, no new calves had been observed on the island, suggesting that,
   following repeated annual treatment with PZP (3 or 4 years), bison do
   not resume normal reproduction for at least 4 or 5 years, and that fewer
   treatments would be advisable if a faster return to fertility is
   desired. Based on observations of bull and cow behavior, and FP levels,
   cows displayed estrous cycles consistently throughout the study period,
   indicating that bison may ovulate year-round when conception and its
   consequences, e.g., lactation and presence of calves, are blocked.
   Because there is little evidence that an extended breeding season would
   negatively impact the health of bulls or result in large numbers of
   out-of-season births on Catalina, PZP appears to be a highly effective
   tool for managing the population of introduced bison on the island.
   However, the extended period of contraception and breeding activity of
   both cows and bulls may make PZP less suitable in high-latitude,
   predator-rich environments where bison conservation remains a top
   priority.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Human development strongly influences large carnivore survival and
   persistence globally. Behavior changes are often the first measureable
   responses to human disturbances, and can have ramifications on animal
   populations and ecological communities. We investigated how a large
   carnivore responds to anthropogenic disturbances by measuring activity,
   movement behavior, and energetics in pumas along a housing density
   gradient. We used log-linear analyses to examine how habitat, time of
   day, and proximity to housing influenced the activity patterns of both
   male and female pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains. We used spatial GPS
   location data in combination with Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration
   measurements recorded by onboard accelerometers to quantify how
   development density affected the average distances traveled and energy
   expended by pumas. Pumas responded to development differently depending
   on the time of day; at night, they were generally more active and moved
   further when they were in developed areas, but these relationships were
   not consistent during the day. Higher nighttime activity in developed
   areas increased daily caloric expenditure by 10.1\% for females and
   11.6\% for males, resulting in increases of 3.4 and 4.0 deer prey
   required annually by females and males respectively. Our results support
   that pumas have higher energetic costs and resource requirements in
   human-dominated habitats due to human-induced behavioral change.
   Increased energetic costs for pumas are likely to have ramifications on
   prey species and exacerbate human-wildlife conflict, especially as
   exurban growth continues. Future conservation work should consider the
   consequences of behavioral shifts on animal energetics, individual
   fitness, and population viability.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{284}},
Number = {{1864}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Empirical studies imply that sex-specific genetic architectures can
   resolve evolutionary conflicts between males and females, and thereby
   facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sex-specificity of
   behavioural genetic architectures has, however, rarely been considered.
   Moreover, as the expression of genetic (co) variances is often
   environment-dependent, general inferences on sex-specific genetic
   architectures require estimates of quantitative genetics parameters
   under multiple conditions. We measured exploration and aggression in
   pedigreed populations of southern field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus)
   raised on either naturally balanced (free-choice) or imbalanced
   (protein-deprived) diets. For each dietary condition, we measured for
   each behavioural trait (i) level of sexual dimorphism, (ii) level of
   sex-specificity of survival selection gradients, (iii) level of
   sex-specificity of additive genetic variance, and (iv) strength of the
   cross-sex genetic correlation. We report here evidence for sexual
   dimorphism in behaviour as well as sex-specificity in the expression of
   genetic (co) variances as predicted by theory. The additive genetic
   variances of exploration and aggression were significantly greater in
   males compared with females. Cross-sex genetic correlations were highly
   positive for exploration but deviating (significantly) from one for
   aggression; findings were consistent across dietary treatments. This
   suggests that genetic architectures characterize the sexually dimorphic
   focal behaviours across various key environmental conditions in the
   wild. Our finding also highlights that sexual conflict can be resolved
   by evolving sexually independent genetic architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Feed deprivation has deleterious effects on fish behavior and stress
   physiology which may susceptible them to disease outbreak. Functional
   ingredients in diets may substantially impact the physiology and stress
   responses of host organisms. Here, we hypothesized that the
   administration of a dietary prebiotic might attenuate the negative
   influences of feed deprivation on the behavioral profile of anxiety and
   physiological responses to stress in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were
   fed with either basal or mannan-oligosaccharide supplemented (0.4\%
   MOS/kg diet) diets, once per day (normal-control: CN, and
   normal-prebiotic: PN) or once every other day (starved control: CS, and
   starved-prebiotic: PS) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, fish were subjected to a
   novel tank test to measure anxiety. Fish from the CS treatment exhibited
   more pronounced bottom-dwelling behavior than the other treatments. The
   number of transitions from the bottom to the top third of the novel tank
   was significantly higher in PN fish than the CS specimens. No
   significant differences were found between the CN and PS treatments in
   all of the anxiety behaviors. CS fish showed higher baseline cortisol
   levels than the other treatments, which was in line with higher
   expression of CRH gene in fish subjected to this treatment. Cortisol
   levels and CRH gene expression of the subjects were also measured after
   induction of two routine aquaculture stressors. CN and PS fish exhibited
   similar patterns of cortisol responses at most of the sampling times
   after stress, and PN specimens showed a significantly lower
   concentration of cortisol than the other treatments in most cases.
   Expression of the CRH gene was higher in feed deprived fish immediately
   after stress induction. Overall, the results show that feed deprivation
   in some cases influenced anxiety-like behaviors and elevated stress
   response in zebrafish juveniles; however, the addition of MOS to the
   diet helped deprived fish exhibit behaviors more typical of normally fed
   animals.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{The trophic behavior of marine predators varies according to the level
   of competition to which they are exposed. In general, populations that
   inhabit lower productivity systems face a strong intraspecific
   competition, which contributes to the development of different foraging
   strategies to maximize nutritional efficiency. Given the high trophic
   flexibility of Zalophus wollebaeki, this species is considered
   appropriate for the analysis of such behavior. Furthermore, this trophic
   flexibility has allowed them to persist in a seemingly marginal
   ecosystem. In this study, we used a comparative analysis of variables
   (diet and dive behavior) related to Z. wollebaeki trophic niche
   plasticity to better understand their foraging ecology, using techniques
   such scat analysis, satellite telemetry and complementarily an isotopic
   analysis. Scat analysis revealed intra-population variation in their
   diet, represented by prey from different environments (epipelagic and
   benthic). These results are supported by the animals' locations at sea
   and diving profiles. Global Positioning System (GPS) and time-depth
   recorder (TDR) records showed the existence of two groups, with
   differing feeding areas and diving behavior. Also the delta N-15 values
   showed differences in the trophic level at which the species fed. These
   results constitute a relevant finding in the evolutionary behavior of
   the species, showing that Z. wollebaeki has developed a high degree of
   foraging flexibility, thus increasing its survival rate in an ecosystem
   that is highly demanding in terms of resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress on neural pathways underlying individual
   behaviors, how an animal balances and prioritizes behavioral outputs
   remains poorly understood. While studying the relationship between
   hunger induced feeding and pup-induced maternal behaviors in virgin
   female mice, we made the unexpected discovery that presence of pups
   strongly delayed and decreased food consumption. Strikingly, presence of
   pups also suppressed feeding induced by optogenetic activation of Agrp
   neurons. Such a suppressive effect inversely correlated with the extents
   of maternal behaviors, but did not rely on the display of these
   behaviors, and was also present in virgin males. Furthermore,
   chemogenetic activation of Vglut2+ neurons in the medial preoptic area
   (mPOA), a region critical for maternal behaviors and motivation, was
   sufficient to suppress hunger-induced feeding. However, muscimol
   inhibition of the mPOA, while disrupting maternal behaviors, did not
   prevent pup suppression of feeding, indicating that neural pathways in
   other brain regions may also mediate such an effect. Together, these
   results provide novel insights into neural coordination of pup care and

Title = {{Linking fishes to multiple metrics of coral reef structural complexity

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Structural complexity strongly influences biodiversity and ecosystem
   productivity. On coral reefs, structural complexity is typically
   measured using a single and small-scale metric ('rugosity') that
   represents multiple spatial attributes differentially exploited by
   species, thus limiting a complete understanding of how fish associate
   with reef structure. We used a novel approach to compare relationships
   between fishes and previously unavailable components of reef complexity,
   and contrasted the results against the traditional rugosity index. This
   study focused on damselfish to explore relationships between fishes and
   reef structure. Three territorial species, with contrasting trophic
   habits and expected use of the reef structure, were examined to infer
   the potential species-specific mechanisms associated with how complexity
   influences habitat selection. Three-dimensional reef reconstructions
   from photogrammetry quantified the following metrics of habitat quality:
   1) visual exposure to predators and competitors, 2) density of predation
   refuges and 3) substrate-related food availability. These metrics
   explained the species distribution better than the traditional measure
   of rugosity, and each species responded to different complexity
   components. Given that a critical effect of reef degradation is loss of
   structure, adopting three-dimensional technologies potentially offers a
   new tool to both understand species-habitat association and help
   forecast how fishes will be affected by the flattening of reefs.}},

Journal = {{AIDS AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2, 2}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The harmful use of alcohol is a component cause for more than 200
   diseases. The association between alcohol consumption, risk taking
   behavior and a range of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS is well
   established. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS as well as harmful alcohol use
   in low and middle income countries is high. Alcohol has been identified
   as a modifiable risk factor in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.
   The objective of this paper is to define research priorities for the
   interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS in low and middle income countries.
   The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) priority
   setting methodology was applied in order to assess research priorities
   of the interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. A group of 171 global and
   local experts in the field of alcohol and or HIV/AIDS related research
   were identified and invited to generate research questions. This
   resulted in 205 research questions which have been categorized and
   refined by senior researchers into 48 research questions to be evaluated
   using five criteria: answerability, effectiveness, feasibility,
   applicability and impact, as well as equity. A total of 59 experts
   participated independently in the voluntary scoring exercise (a 34\%
   response rate). There was substantial consensus among experts on
   priorities for research on alcohol and HIV. These tended to break down
   into two categories, those focusing on better understanding the nexus
   between alcohol and HIV and those directed towards informing practical
   interventions to reduce the impact of alcohol use on HIV treatment
   outcomes, which replicates what Bryant (Subst Use Misuse 41:1465-1507,
   2006) and Parry et al. (Addiction 108:1-2, 2012) found. Responses from
   experts were stratified by location in order to determine any
   differences between groups. On average experts in the LMIC gave higher
   scores than the HIC experts. Recent research has shown the causal link
   between alcohol consumption and the incidence of HIV/AIDS including a
   better understanding of the pathways through which alcohol use affects
   ARV adherence (and other medications to treat opportunistic infections)
   and CD4 counts. The results of this process clearly indicated that the
   important priorities for future research related to the development and
   assessment of interventions focusing on addressing alcohol and HIV/AIDS,
   addressing and exploring the impact of HIV risk and comorbid alcohol
   use, as well as exploring the risk and protective factors in the field
   of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. The findings from this priority setting
   exercise could guide international research agenda and make research
   funding more effective in addressing the research on intersection of
   alcohol and HIV/AIDS.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The early life stage is typically a selective bottleneck during which
   individual performance is important for survival. We investigated size,
   energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in
   the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout.
   In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown
   trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the
   laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but
   not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the
   fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1
   month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully
   compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued
   growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural
   environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual
   baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food
   restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by
   growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive
   association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by
   recapture probability), but no significant differences between
   food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively
   influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in
   the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption
   that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments.
   For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with
   high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to
   high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and
   reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk.
   Significance statement
   In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better
   survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the
   balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due
   to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals
   can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely
   limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as
   growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab,
   but not realized in natural streams.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Personality and innovativeness are predicted to drive important
   functional behaviours that can influence life history strategies within
   populations. For example, the reactive-proactive personality axis is
   thought to reflect the `pace of life' syndrome and predicts correlation
   with foraging; empirical evidence also suggests a positive correlation
   with routine-like behaviour. Similarly, the adaptive innovation
   hypothesis predicts that innovators may have a higher food intake when
   novel foraging opportunities arise, and that they should have a more
   diverse range of foraging tactics. Experimental tests of these
   hypotheses are limited. We conducted standardized assays of exploratory
   behaviour (an index of the reactive-proactive axis) and innovative
   problem-solving performance on wild-captured great tits, Parus major,
   temporarily brought into captivity from different woodland types. To
   test for dietary preferences, birds were provided with three different
   types of food, and their daily energy intake measured. We found no
   evidence of a significant relationship between exploratory behaviour and
   the amount of calories ingested. However, fast-exploring great tits
   consumed a higher proportion of sunflower seeds, while slower
   individuals preferred peanuts. Problem-solving performance was
   positively correlated with energy intake but not food preference.
   Peanuts accounted for a larger proportion of total daily energy intake
   for coniferous birds, which also lost more weight on average. Our
   results illustrate that a complex array of factors can determine
   foraging behaviour and success, including personality, innovativeness,
   state variables, time, and habitat origin. This highlights the challenge
   of explaining how selection acts on foraging performance over time.
   Significance statement
   Experimental tests assessing how personality and innovativeness drive
   functional behaviour within populations are limited. We studied these
   links by means of exploratory behaviour and innovative problem-solving
   performance tests in relation to food preference and energy intake in
   wild-captured great tits, Parus major, from two different habitats.
   Personality was related to dietary preference (fast explorers consumed a
   higher proportion of sunflower seeds, while slower individuals preferred
   peanuts), and problem-solving was related to energy intake. Moreover, we
   found differential diet selection between coniferous and deciduous
   birds. Our results show that foraging behaviour and body mass are driven
   by multiple factors, including personality, innovativeness, and habitat
   origin.}},

Abstract = {{Escape-response behaviour is essential to ensure an individual's
   survival during a predator attack, however, these behaviours are
   energetically costly and may cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress
   can be reduced by supplementing an individual's diet with exogenous
   antioxidants or through regular moderate exercise training, which
   stimulates the upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant system. Two
   studies have tested the simultaneous effects of dietary antioxidant
   supplementation and exercise training on animal escape-response
   behaviour. The present study investigated the effects of dietary
   carotenoids and exercise training on the escape response behaviour of
   Southern Corroboree frogs. Frogs were fed either a
   carotenoid-supplemented or unsupplemented diet and were exposed to

   Carotenoid-supplemented individuals outperformed unsupplemented
   individuals in initial hopping speed, length of the first hop and
   hopping distance, however, the performance of frogs in each treatment
   group became statistically similar after training. Within treatment
   groups, exercise training significantly improved the hopping speed of
   unsupplemented frogs, with speeds almost doubling between training weeks
   one and five. By contrast, exercise training did not significantly
   improve the hopping speed of carotenoid-supplemented frogs. Our results
   provide some of the first evidence that exercise training improves
   escape performance, and that dietary antioxidants may inhibit
   training-induced benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major health concern in modern societies. Although
   decreased physical activity and enhanced intake of high-caloric foods
   are important risk factors for developing obesity, human behavior during
   eating also plays a role. Previous studies have shown that distraction
   while eating increases food intake and leads to impaired processing of
   food stimuli. As olfaction is the most important sense involved in
   flavor perception, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   techniques to investigate the influence of cognitive memory load on
   olfactory perception and processing. Low-and high-caloric food odors
   were presented in combination with either low or high cognitive loads
   utilizing a memory task. The efficacy of the memory task was verified by
   a decrease in participant recall accuracy and an increase in skin
   conductance response during high cognitive load. Our behavioral data
   reveal a diminished perceived intensity for low-but not high-caloric
   food odors during high cognitive load. For low-caloric food odors,
   bilateral orbitofrontal (OFC) and piriform cortices (pirC) showed
   significantly lower activity during high compared with low cognitive
   load. For high-caloric food odors, a similar effect was established in
   pirC, but not in OFC. Insula activity correlates with higher intensity
   ratings found during the low cognitive load condition. We conclude lower
   activity in pirC and OFC to be responsible for diminished intensity
   perception, comparable to results in olfactory impaired patients and
   elderly. Further studies should investigate the influence of
   olfactory/gustatory intensities on food choices under distraction with
   special regards to low-caloric food.}},

Abstract = {{An autoshaping procedure was used to test the notion that conditioned

   then followed immediately by a food unconditioned stimulus (US). A
   second lever (CS-) was presented on intermixed trials and was not

   than in young adults. Initially, group differences were observed when
   rats were retrained when the adolescents had reached young adulthood.
   These findings support the hypothesis that cues that come to predict

Abstract = {{Changes in climate can indirectly regulate populations at higher trophic
   levels by influencing the availability of food resources in the lower
   reaches of the food web. As such, species that rely on fruit and nectar
   food resources may be particularly sensitive to these bottom-up
   perturbations due to the strength of their trophic linkages with
   climatically-influenced plants. To measure the influence of
   climatically-mediated, bottom-up processes, we used climate, bird
   capture, bird count, and plant phenology data from the Big Island of
   Hawaii to construct a series of structural equationand abundance models.
   Our results suggest that fruit and nectar-eating birds arrange life
   cycle events around climatically-influenced food resources, while some
   of these same food resources also influence seasonal patterns of
   abundance. This trend was particularly strong for two native
   nectarivores, `I'iwi and `Apapane, where we found that the dissimilar
   timing of molting and breeding activity was associated with peak
   abundance of the two most common flowers at our study site which, in
   turn, were each driven by dissimilar climatic cues. Given the rapidly
   changing Hawaiian climate, we suggest that determining behavioral
   plasticity, or evolutionary capacity of birds to mitigate changes in

Abstract = {{The expression of different behavioral components in the adult rat
   depends on a number of early influences, including age, hormones,
   manipulations of sensory cues, and perinatal undernutrition, all of
   which impact the development of brain areas underlying adaptive
   processes, maternal behavior, and the response to novelty. The current
   study investigates the effects of pre- and neonatal undernutrition on
   various components of maternal behavior of dams exposed to the challenge
   of an unfamiliar home cage on days 4, 8, and 12 of lactation. Food
   restriction was initiated from gestational day (G) G6 to G19 when dams
   received 50-70\% of the normal balanced diet, followed by 100\% from G20
   to G21. After birth, pups were underfed by alternating every 12 h
   between two lactating dams, one of which, had ligated nipples. Weaning
   was at 25 days of age followed by an ad libitum diet until postpartum
   day 90, when females were mated, and subsequently tested for maternal
   behavior in an unfamiliar cage. The results indicated that in early
   underfed mothers the frequency of handling wood shavings and of,
   approaching, licking, crouching, and grasping pups for retrieval was
   significantly reduced. Moreover, self grooming increased substantially
   in the underfed dams, but the frequency of rearing was reduced.
   Additionally, the body weight of pups nursed by early underfed dams was
   significantly lower than that of control pups. These findings suggest a
   relation between early food restriction and the deficient maternal care
   observed when these dams were challenged by exposure to an unfamiliar
   home cage.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of graywolves (Canis lupus) can directly and indirectly
   affect beef cattle (Bos taurus) production on rangelands of the Northern
   Rocky Mountains. While fairly extensive knowledge exists for the direct
   effects of wolf predation threat (e.g., cattle death and injury losses,
   elevated stress), our understanding of wolf-caused changes in cattle
   behavior and the associated cascade of potential indirect effects on
   cattle resource selection, diet quality, activity budgets, and energetic
   relationships is still largely in its infancy. We investigated whether
   wolf presence affected the daily travel distance of Global Positioning
   System(GPS)-collared cattle under a replicated, Impact-Control study
   conducted inwestern Idaho and northeasternOregon during 2008-2012.
   Cattle in three Control (Oregon) study areas, where wolf presence was
   consistently low, traveled farther per day (13.7 +/- 0.396 SE km
   day(-1)) than those in three Impact (Idaho) study areas (11.4 +/- 0.396
   SE km day(-1)) with moderate to high wolf presence. At Control study
   areas, cattle traveled farthest per day in July (13.2 +/- 0.355 SE km
   day(-1)) and were least mobile in October (11.8 +/- 0.365 SE km
   day(-1)), but daily travel distances were similar across all months for
   cattle in Impact study areas. This observational study provides evidence
   suggesting cattle in mountainous grazing areas alter their spatial
   behavior in response to gray wolf presence. These behavioral changes
   have energetic consequences that could potentially impact cattle
   productivity and ranch economics. Additional research into the activity
   budget and resource selection responses of these collared cattle is
   required to better understand the specific mechanisms behind these daily

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{29-34}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary
   process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and
   colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome
   suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural
   tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the
   composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately,
   colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition
   dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an
   individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as
   competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was
   linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression
   in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a
   successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to
   our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity,
   exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency
   was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals
   dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The
   presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1)
   dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2)
   aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding,
   thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of
   their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the
   ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and
   suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an
   important role in dispersal decisions. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Cities are rapidly expanding, and wildlife may experience different
   selection pressures in urban environments when compared to natural
   habitats. Phenotypic differences between urban and natural populations
   may occur because of the altered urban environment. Behavior, the
   activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and body
   condition can be expected to differ between urban and natural habitats.
   We used the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) to test for differences
   in behavior assayed from an open field test, hair and fecal cortisol
   concentrations, and body condition (size-corrected body mass),
   predicting that urban chipmunks would exhibit more exploratory behavior,
   higher cortisol concentrations, and higher body condition, than their
   counterparts from natural habitats. We sampled eastern chipmunks in 2
   urban areas paired with natural habitats and subjected adult chipmunks
   to an open field test, collected hair and fecal samples for the
   determination of cortisol concentrations, and measured body size and
   body mass to estimate body condition. Eastern chipmunks in urban
   habitats had significantly different behavior, tending toward reduced
   locomotion and grooming, and greater latency, than their counterparts
   from natural habitats. Urban chipmunks also had lower fecal cortisol
   concentrations than those from natural habitats, and female chipmunks
   were in better body condition when captured in urban habitats. These
   results suggest that urban habitats may be relatively benign for urban

Abstract = {{Obesity affects more than 35\% of Americans, increasing the risk of more
   than 200 comorbid conditions, impaired quality of life and premature
   mortality. This review aimed to summarize literature published over the
   past 15years regarding the prevalence and impact of obesity in people
   with haemophilia (PWH) and to discuss implementing general guidelines
   for weight management in the context of the haemophilia comprehensive
   care team. Although few studies have assessed the effects of obesity on
   haemophilia-specific outcomes, existing evidence indicates an important
   impact of weight status on lower extremity joint range of motion and
   functional disability, with potentially important effects on overall
   quality of life. Data regarding bleeding tendency in PWH with coexisting
   obesity are largely inconclusive; however, some individuals may
   experience reduced joint bleeds following moderate weight loss.
   Additionally, conventional weight-based dosing of factor replacement
   therapy leads to increased treatment costs for PWH with obesity or
   overweight, suggesting pharmacoeconomic benefits of weight loss.
   Evidence-based recommendations for weight loss include behavioural
   strategies to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity,
   pharmacotherapy and surgical therapy in appropriate patients. Unique
   considerations in PWH include bleed-related risks with physical
   activity; thus, healthcare professionals should advise patients on types
   and intensities of, and approaches to, physical activity, how to adjust
   treatment to accommodate exercise and how to manage potential
   activity-related bleeding. Increasing awareness of these issues may
   improve identification of PWH with coexisting obesity and referral to
   appropriate specialists, with potentially wide-ranging benefits in
   overall health and well-being.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{943-960}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Seasonality creates a template for many natural processes and
   evolutionary adaptations. Organisms are often faced with an annual cycle
   consisting of a productive (favorable) and unproductive period. This
   yearly cycle along with other seasonal variations in abiotic factors and
   associated biotic interactions form strong selection pressures shaping
   the scheduling of annual activities and the developmental stages and
   modes of life through the year. Annual decisions impact trade-offs that
   involve both current and future reproductive value (RV), and life
   history theory provides the foundation to understand these linkages
   between phenology and an organism's full life. Annual routine models
   further allow for multiple annual decisions to be optimized and
   predicted with respect to lifetime consequences. Studies of life history
   adaptations to seasonality are concerned with questions such as: within
   the productive season, should growth come first, followed by
   reproduction, or the other way around? What is the best time to diapause
   or migrate, and how will this timing impact other life history traits?
   Should energy reserves be built, to transfer resources from 1 year to
   the next, and allow for the spatial and temporal freedom of capital
   breeding? If offspring value is low during parts of the productive
   season, what is then the best alternative to reproduction: accumulate
   stores, grow, or wait in safety? To help answer these and other
   questions, I provide an overview of key theoretical concepts and some of
   the main life schedules, annual routines, and trade-offs involved.
   Adaptations to the unproductive period include diapause (dormancy),
   embryonic resting stages (eggs, seeds), energy reserves, and seasonal
   migrations. Adaptations to the productive window include rapid growth,
   high reproductive effort, capital breeding, and reproduction entrained
   to the annual cycle and with precise timing. Distinct annual routines,
   large body size, energy storage capacities, and parental care are also
   adaptations to seasonality. Phenotypic plasticity and state-dependence
   are important parts of these traits and are adaptations in their own. I
   give particular attention to timing of breeding and the associated
   birth-time dependent contributions to fitness. Seasonality in offspring
   value impacts the scheduling of growth, storage, and reproduction and
   may create parent-offspring conflicts over breeding timing. A combined
   offspring and parent value perspective should be adopted more broadly,
   also because of the management implications. I further argue for
   strategic but careful use of latitudinal (and altitudinal) gradients,
   and more attention to the role of seasonally varying predation risk as a
   selective force.}},

Abstract = {{Invasion success is dependent on the ability of a species to discover
   and exploit novel food resources. Within this context, individuals must
   be willing to taste novel foods. They must also be capable of evaluating
   the nutritional content of new foods, and selecting their relative
   intake in order to fulfil their nutritional needs. Whereas the former
   capacity is well studied, little is known about the latter capacity.
   First, using the common myna as a model avian invader species, we
   quantified the willingness of mynas to taste novel foods relative to
   familiar ones. Mynas readily tasted high protein (HP) novel foods and
   consumed them in higher quantities compared to a familiar food. Data
   showed that at three different levels - mixes, ingredients and
   macronutrients - intake could not be explained by a random model. In
   experiment 2, we confirmed that mynas were making their selection based
   on protein (P) content rather than a selection for novelty per se. When
   given the choice of three equally unfamiliar foods, mynas again ate
   disproportionately from the high protein relative to high lipid and high
   carbohydrate foods. Analysis revealed that mynas consumed amounts of
   protein that were closer to the ones in their natural diet. Finally, in
   experiment 3, we measured inter-individual variation in innovation and
   exploration propensities, and examined associations with
   inter-individual variation in consumption of specific macronutrients.
   This analysis revealed that individuals that selected HP pellets were
   more exploratory and individuals that selected HC pellets were quicker
   to solve the innovative foraging task. These findings indicate that not
   only the willingness to taste novel foods, but also the capacity to
   evaluate their nutritional content, might be central to the myna's
   substantial ecological success.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases,
   including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is increasing. Exclusion of
   the foregut, as occurs in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, has a key role in
   the metabolic improvements that occur following bariatric surgery, which
   are independent of weight loss. Endoscopically placed duodenal-jejunal
   bypass sleeve devices, such as the EndoBarrier (GI Dynamics, Lexington,
   Massachusetts, USA), have been designed to create an impermeable barrier
   between chyme exiting the stomach and the mucosa of the duodenum and
   proximal jejunum. The non-surgical and reversible nature of these
   devices represents an attractive therapeutic option for patients with
   obesity and T2DM by potentially improving glycaemic control and reducing
   their weight.
   Methods and analysis In this multicentre, randomised, controlled,
   non-blinded trial, male and female patients aged 18-65 years with a body
   mass index 30-50 kg/m(2) and inadequately controlled T2DM on oral
   antihyperglycaemic medications (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 58-97
   mmol/mol) will be randomised in a 1: 1 ratio to receive either the
   EndoBarrier device (n=80) for 12 months or conventional medical therapy,
   diet and exercise (n=80). The primary outcome measure will be a
   reduction in HbA1c by 20\% at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures will
   include percentage weight loss, change in cardiovascular risk factors
   and medications, quality of life, cost, quality-adjusted life years
   accrued and adverse events. Three additional subgroups will investigate
   the mechanisms behind the effect of the EndoBarrier device, looking at
   changes in gut hormones, metabolites, bile acids, microbiome, food
   hedonics and preferences, taste, brain reward system responses to food,
   eating and addictive behaviours, body fat content, insulin sensitivity,
   and intestinal tissue gene expression.}},

   home fortification with iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders
   (MMPs) to children under 2 years, evidence for benefits of these
   interventions on childhood development (a key rationale for these
   interventions) and harms (especially infection) remains limited. This
   study aims to evaluate the impact of iron or MMPs supplementation
   compared with placebo on (a) children's development, (b) growth, (c)
   morbidity from infections and (d) haematological and iron indices.
   Methods and analysis This study is a three-arm, blinded, double-dummy,
   parallel-group, placebo-controlled superiority trial using stratified
   individual block randomisation. The trial will randomise 3300 children
   aged 8-9 months equally to arm 1: iron syrup (12.5 mg elemental iron),
   placebo MMPs; arm 2: MMPs (including 12.5 mg elemental iron), placebo
   syrup; and arm 3: placebo syrup, placebo MNPs. Children will receive
   interventions for 3 months based on WHO recommendations and then be
   followed up for 9 months post intervention. The primary outcome is
   cognitive composite score measured by Bayley III. Secondary outcomes
   include motor and language composite score by Bayley III, behaviour
   rating using selected items from Wolke's rating scales and BSID-II
   behaviour ratings, temperament, growth, haemoglobin, anaemia and iron
   status, and infectious morbidity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline,
   at the end of 3-month intervention and after 9 months postintervention
   follow-up.
   Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the Ethical
   Review Committee of icddr,b (Dhaka, Bangladesh) and the Melbourne Health
   Human Research Ethics Committee (Melbourne, Australia). Results of the
   study will be disseminated through scientific publications,
   presentations at international meetings and policy briefs to key
   stakeholders.

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This study explored Pasifika peoples' understandings of Deliberate
   Self-Harm (DSH) based on the perspective of Pacific health professionals
   in New Zealand. A total of 20 informants were interviewed using
   semi-structured Talanoa methods. Informants held professional roles in
   the mental health, social and addiction sectors in Auckland, (female, n
   = 10, male, n = 10). DSH was defined as an intentional act of inflicting
   harm to the physical, mental or spiritual self, and served separate
   functions from suicidal intent. DSH was defined to include both direct
   self-harm, as well as indirect forms of self-harm over time including,
   alcohol and drug misuse, gambling, self-starvation and risk taking
   behaviours. Intentional harm to the spiritual or the mental self
   included deliberate disconnection from spiritual faith and holding
   adverse perspectives and worldviews.
   Conclusion: Based on the findings it is recommended that a) DSH may be
   acknowledged as a behaviour that can be separated from suicide in terms
   of functionality, b) the present clinical DSH diagnosis criteria should
   include Pacific definitions of DSH, c) best-practice clinical treatment
   guidelines should accordingly be reviewed to incorporate treatment that
   encapsulate DSH behaviours relevant to Pacific people, and finally, d)
   researchers need to adopt operational definitions that reflects Pacific
   conceptualisations of DSH when conducting studies with Pacific
   communities in New Zealand.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and
   maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population
   in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome)
   behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that
   behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition,
   gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through
   behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are
   labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to
   be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term
   environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood
   remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory
   experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time
   available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on
   activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green
   lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of
   behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency
   (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation
   for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean
   behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual
   behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments.
   Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found
   significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long
   basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but
   affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher
   in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size
   (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking
   treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when
   food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change
   can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect
   could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural
   predictability, but not in behavioural type.}},

Title = {{Artificial selection for odor-guided behavior in Drosophila reveals
   changes in food consumption}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The olfactory system enables organisms to detect chemical
   cues in the environment and can signal the availability of food or the
   presence of a predator. Appropriate behavioral responses to these
   chemical cues are therefore important for organismal survival and can
   influence traits such as organismal life span and food consumption.
   However, understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying odor-guided
   behavior, correlated responses in other traits, and how these constrain
   or promote their evolution, remain an important challenge. Here, we
   performed artificial selection for attractive and aversive behavioral
   responses to four chemical compounds, two aromatics (4-ethylguaiacol and
   4-methylphenol) and two esters (methyl hexanoate and ethyl acetate), for
   thirty generations.
   Results: Artificial selection for odor-guided behavior revealed
   symmetrical responses to selection for each of the four chemical
   compounds. We then investigated whether selection for odor-guided
   behavior resulted in correlated responses in life history traits and/or
   food consumption. We found changes in food consumption upon selection
   for behavioral responses to aromatics. In many cases, lines selected for
   increased attraction to aromatics showed an increase in food
   consumption. We then performed RNA sequencing of lines selected for
   responses to 4-ethylguaiacol to identify candidate genes associated with
   odor-guided behavior and its impact on food consumption. We identified
   91 genes that were differentially expressed among lines, many of which
   were associated with metabolic processes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of
   select candidate genes further supports their role in odor-guided
   behavior and/or food consumption.
   Conclusions: This study identifies novel genes underlying variation in
   odor-guided behavior and further elucidates the genetic mechanisms
   underlying the interrelationship between olfaction and feeding.}},

   carbohydrate and lipid, respectively; n 34) or satiating (20-25, 45-50
   and 30-35 \% energy as protein, carbohydrate and lipid, respectively; n

   (HSP) satiety phenotype. Both diets were consumed ad libitum. Changes in
   body weight, BMI, percent fat mass, waist circumference, satiety
   responsiveness and eating behaviour traits were assessed following the
   intervention. Dropout rates were higher in the control diet (441 \%)
   compared with the satiating diet (86 \%). Decreases in body weight, BMI
   and waist circumference were significant in both groups, yet HSP
   individuals lost more body weight than LSP individuals (P=0048).
   Decreases in \% fat mass were greater in the satiating diet (LSP: -21

Abstract = {{BackgroundEarly childhood temperament is increasingly recognized as an
   important attribute that may impact screen time use, outdoor play and
   childhood obesity. The relationship between temperament and nutrition in
   preschool children is less clear.
   ObjectiveThe objective of the study is to investigate if temperament
   dimensions (negative affectivity, effortful control and surgency) in
   early childhood are associated with nutritional risk factors.
   MethodsSix hundred seventy-eight children were followed (mean age at
   baseline visit 3.1years; mean time to follow-up 16.5months). Parents
   reported on child temperament and nutritional risk factors during
   regularly scheduled well-child clinic visits.
   ResultsA mixed effect model demonstrated a significant association
   between higher negative affectivity (1.03; 95\% CI 0.69 to 1.37) and
   higher effortful control (-0.88; 95\% CI -1.27 to -0.49) on concurrent
   nutritional risk, independent of covariates. Multivariate linear
   regression analysis identified that higher effortful control, and not
   negative affectivity, was significantly associated with a decrease in
   nutritional risk (-0.67; 95\% CI -1.10 to -0.24) over time, independent
   of covariates. There was no relationship identified between surgency and
   nutritional risk.
   ConclusionThree-year-old children with higher effortful control had
   reduced nutritional risk at 5years of age. Future nutritional risk
   prevention strategies may benefit from interventions to increase
   effortful control in early childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Prior work has suggested a paradoxical positive relationship between the

   perspectives exist on the mechanisms that may explain the positive
   relationship. The aims of this study were to test theorized mechanisms
   of association, including common causes shared by both behaviors (e.g.,
   personality, motives, affective), compensatory processes such as
   exercising to compensate for calories from alcohol consumption, and
   methodological confounds (e.g., between vs. within subject effects) in a
   college sample (N = 132; 56.3\% male; 76\% Caucasian; M (age) = 19.15,
   SD = 0.99) using a cross-sectional design and time line follow back

   exercise was found and explained by exercising to compensate for
   calories of alcohol consumption, enhancement motives, and physical
   activity enjoyment. However, we also observed a significant and negative
   within-subjects association between the two constructs, suggesting that,
   on a given day, individuals who exercise more tended to drink less.
   Furthermore, individuals who exercised more during the week tended to
   have declines in weekend drinking over time. Results suggest a complex
   relationship between exercise and alcohol use among young adults, and

Abstract = {{When exposed to an environment that promotes a sedentary lifestyle and
   food accessibility, some individuals are at a higher risk of weight
   gain. This individual difference can be explained by gene-environment
   interactions. It has been shown that some individuals have a genetic
   predisposition to obesity. In addition, a genetic component has been
   associated with eating behaviour traits such as cognitive restraint,
   disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger, all of which are also
   linked to obesity. The purpose of this review article is to present the
   current state of knowledge on the heritability of specific eating
   behaviour traits and to then identify the genes associated with these
   behaviours. The findings show that disinhibition and susceptibility to
   hunger are 2 eating behaviour traits that are particularly heritable and
   that several candidate genes are now associated with eating behaviour
   traits. These findings indicate that we are far from equal when it comes
   to food and can help professionals better understand the variability
   observed in an intervention context. Identifying genes associated with
   eating behaviour traits is crucial to better identify and intervene with

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Stress is ubiquitous in nature and organisms have evolved mechanisms to
   cope with it. Stress responses nevertheless vary based on the type of
   stress, its duration, magnitude, and the organism's physiological
   status. We studied here the effect of two separately applied stress
   types, differing also in their duration, on various behavioral responses
   of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The two stress types
   applied were short-term cold stress and long-term low protein stress.
   The behavioral response variables were movement activity, preference to
   move along the test arena edges, latency to emerge from shelter, and
   preference for dark microhabitat, measured at two stages of the beetles'
   lives, as young adults after eclosion and one month later. Behavioral
   responses were stress-specific. Cold-stressed beetles moved over the
   longest distances but were also the most reluctant to leave an
   accessible shelter. We interpret this to mean that cold-stressed beetles
   were the most active under unfavorable conditions and least bold under
   more favorable, protected conditions. As beetles aged, their movement
   activity decreased and latency to emerge from shelter increased.
   Non-stressed beetles were the most consistent in their behavior across
   all behavioral tests. This finding is similar to those in previous
   studies and suggests that moderate stress reduces behavioral
   consistency. While all beetles gained mass during the study period, the
   two stress types led to different patterns of body mass increase, which
   was more moderate for cold stressed than for protein-stressed beetles.}},

   Methods: Convergent parallel mixed methods triangulation design
   comprised a cross-sectional survey (n = 81) and 8 focus group
   discussions with 7-10 poststroke participants in each group. We assessed
   participant characteristics and obtained insights into their salt
   consumption attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge. Qualitative responses
   were analyzed using an inductive approach with thematic analytic
   procedures. Relationships between healthy dietary salt compliance,
   dietary salt knowledge, and participant characteristics were assessed
   using logistic regression analyses. Results: Healthy dietary salt
   consumption behaviors were associated with basic salt knowledge (P
   <.0001), but no association was found between compliance and salt
   disease-related knowledge (P =.314). Only 20\% and 7\% obtained
   health-related salt knowledge from their health facility and educational

   sodium. Conclusion: One barrier to healthy dietary consumption choices
   among Uganda's stroke survivors is a lack of credible disease-related

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine compensatory changes in sedentary
   behavior (SB) and light-intensity physical activities (LIPA) in response
   to a 22-week exercise training program in overweight/obese adults; and
   to determine if different forms of exercise training and physical
   activity recommendations interact with these compensatory changes.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Eighty-nine overweight and obese individuals (body
   mass index (BMI): 25-34.9 kg/m(2), 48\% males), aged 1850 years, were
   randomized into four intervention groups (strength, endurance, combined
   strength + endurance and physical activity recommendations) with a
   25-30\% caloric restriction of total daily energy expenditure for 22
   weeks. Energy expenditure was measured by accelerometry before, during
   and after the program.
   RESULTS: LIPA increased significantly (Po0.001) after three months and
   at the end of intervention compared to baseline (pre: 281 +/- 9 min; 3
   months: 303 +/- 9 min; post: 312 +/- 8 min). SB percentage decreased by
   5.3 at the end of the intervention (P = 0.002). No interactions were
   observed between groups or sexes. Significant correlations were found
   between SB and body weight, fat mass, android fat mass and lean body
   mass before and after the intervention (P < 0.05). LIPA was also
   significantly correlated with all these body composition variables in
   the pre-intervention, but only correlated with body weight at the end of
   intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: There were no compensatory changes after a combined
   exercise and diet program; where minutes in LIPA increased and \% SB
   decreased after the program, without differences among exercise modes.
   Greater physical activity levels can contribute to a better percentage
   and distribution of body tissues.}},

   of their offspring in those patches. Many amphibians breed in temporary
   ponds immediately after they fill, and one species, Hyla chrysoscelis
   (Cope's Gray Treefrogs), selects between breeding sites based on patch
   age differences of as little as 7 d. Prior work established that H.
   chrysoscelis have better larval performance in more recently filled
   ponds, but not in ponds less than 15 d after filling or among ponds that
   differed in age by less than 65 d. Our objective was to determine
   experimentally whether larval H. chrysoscelis performance varies across
   short time scales after filling (3- and 23-d-old ponds) and across two
   larval densities (15 and 30 larvae per mesocosm). Higher larval
   densities reduced metamorph mass and body condition, but did not
   otherwise affect larval performance. There were lower survival, shorter
   larval periods, and slightly lower mass and body condition among larvae
   from 3- d-old ponds than those in 23-d-old ponds. These mixed
   performance differences across our two levels of habitat age might not
   necessarily be representative of what happens in natural systems,
   however, where older ponds have more established communities of
   competitors and predators.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although reproductive strategies can be influenced by a variety of
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors, life history theory provides a rigorous
   framework for explaining variation in reproductive effort. The terminal
   investment hypothesis proposes that a decreased expectation of future
   reproduction (as might arise from a mortality threat) should precipitate
   increased investment in current reproduction. Terminal investment has
   been widely studied, and a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic cues that
   elicit such a response have been identified across an array of taxa.
   Although terminal investment is often treated as a static strategy, the
   level at which a cue of decreased future reproduction is sufficient to
   trigger increased current reproductive effort (i.e., the terminal
   investment threshold) may depend on the context, including the internal
   state of the organism or its current external environment, independent
   of the cue that triggers a shift in reproductive investment. Here, we
   review empirical studies that address the terminal investment
   hypothesis, exploring both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that
   mediate its expression. Based on these studies, we propose a novel
   framework within which to view the strategy of terminal investment,
   incorporating factors that influence an individual's residual
   reproductive value beyond a terminal investment trigger-the dynamic
   terminal investment threshold.}},

Title = {{Male hyraxes increase countersinging as strangers become `nasty
   neighbours'}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{9-14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many territorial animals interact less aggressively with neighbours than
   with strangers, a phenomenon known as the `dear enemy' effect, although
   some species show the opposite behaviour. Rock hyraxes, Procavia
   capensis, are social mammals that communicate via a rich acoustic
   repertoire. Male hyraxes produce elaborate advertisement calls (i.e.
   songs) both spontaneously and in response to occasional
   attention-grabbing events (e.g. pup screams, agonistic interaction), as
   well as to conspecific male songs. When replying to conspecific songs,
   male hyraxes tend to respond more to familiar males than to strangers,
   reflecting the `nasty neighbour' effect. Our study relates to the
   general question of why some species respond aggressively towards
   neighbours, while others are more aggressive towards strangers. We
   hypothesized that male hyraxes eventually familiarize themselves with a
   stranger, subsequently perceiving its intentions as highly threatening
   and deserving of a vocal response. To simulate the presence of a
   stranger in the area we exposed wild hyrax groups to playbacks of
   natural songs of unfamiliar hyraxes. Male rock hyraxes became more
   likely to reply to a stranger's song over time, but this was independent
   of the number of times they heard the song. This suggests that either
   (1) the threat presented by a stranger increases when it is no longer
   perceived as transient or (2) because listeners do not physically
   encounter the stranger, they perceive replying aggressively as a
   low-risk response. Our work implies that species may demonstrate a range
   of condition-dependent behaviours instead of a dichotomy between the
   `nasty neighbour' and `dear enemy' strategies. (C) 2017 The Association

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{87-98}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Understanding animal movements is a key prerequisite for deciphering
   ecological processes such as population dynamics, community structure or
   biological invasions. Many animals restrict their movements to certain
   areas (home ranges) by alternating visits among several suitable sites.
   The dynamics of these recursive movements are assumed to be primarily
   driven by food availability and predation risk. In contrast,
   environmental parasite pressures have rarely been considered as possible
   drivers of animals' ranging patterns. In this article, we present
   evidence that environmentally transmitted gastrointestinal parasites may
   shape recursive movement patterns of a group of free-ranging mandrills,
   Mandrillus sphinx. These rainforest-dwelling primates returned less
   frequently and after longer time lags to sites, including sleeping
   sites, they had contaminated than to sites with low contamination
   levels. This pattern was especially pronounced during the dry season,
   when contamination risk was highest. In contrast, rainfall shortened the
   time between visits, consistent with the hypothesis that rainfall may
   wash away parasites, allowing a more rapid return to previously used
   sites. Although resource distribution and predator threat could not be
   ruled out in this study, we suggest that the risk of acquiring
   environmentally transmitted parasites is possibly another factor
   influencing animal ranging patterns as well as habitat selection or
   species distribution. Consequently, parasites and their distribution in
   the environment, as well as the possible antiparasite strategy we
   document here, should be targets for future research on animal movement.

Abstract = {{Obesity and hyperinsulinemia are risk factors for stroke. We tested the
   hypothesis that caloric restriction, which reduces the incidence of
   age-related obesity and metabolic syndrome, may represent an efficient
   and cost-effective strategy for preventing stroke and its devastating
   consequences. To this end, we placed aged, obese Sprague-Dawley aged
   rats on a calorie-restricted diet for 8 weeks prior to the experimental
   infarction. Stroke in this animal model caused a progressive decrease in
   weight that reached a minimum at day 6 for the young rats, and at day 10
   for the aged, ad libitum-fed rats. However, in aged animals that were
   calorie-restricted prior to stroke, body weight did not decrease after
   stroke, but we noted accelerated body weight gain shortly thereafter
   starting at day 5 poststroke. Moreover, calorie-restricted aged animals
   showed improved behavioral recovery in tasks requiring complex
   sensorimotor skills, or in tasks requiring cutaneous sensitivity and
   sensorimotor integration or spatial memory. Likewise, calorie-restricted
   aged rats showed significant poststroke increases in serum glucose,
   insulin, and IGF1 levels, as well as CR-specific changes in the

Abstract = {{Phenological advancement allows individuals to adapt to climate change
   by timing life-history events to the availability of key resources so
   that individual fitness is maximized. However, different trophic levels
   may respond to changes in their environment at different rates,
   potentially leading to a phenological mismatch. This may be especially
   apparent in the highly seasonal arctic environment that is experiencing
   the effects of climate change more so than any other region. During a
   14-year study near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, we estimated
   phenological advancement in egg laying in relation to snowmelt for eight
   arctic-breeding shorebirds and investigated potential linkages to
   species-specific life-history characteristics. We found that snowmelt
   advanced 0.8days/yearsix times faster than the prior 60-year period.
   During this same time, six of the eight species exhibited phenological
   advancement in laying dates (varying among species from 0.1 to 0.9days
   earlier per year), although no species appeared capable of keeping pace
   with advancing snowmelt. Phenological changes were likely the result of
   high phenotypic plasticity, as all species investigated in this study
   showed high interannual variability in lay dates. Commonality among
   species with similar response rates to timing of snowmelt suggests that
   nesting later and having an opportunistic settlement strategy may
   increase the adaptability of some species to changing climate
   conditions. Other life-history characteristics, such as migration
   strategy, previous site experience, and mate fidelity did not influence
   the ability of individuals to advance laying dates. As a failure to
   advance egg laying is likely to result in greater phenological mismatch,
   our study provides an initial assessment of the relative risk of species
   to long-term climatic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Predators select prey so as to maximize energy and minimize manipulation
   time. In order to reduce prey detection and handling time, individuals
   must actively select their foraging space (microhabitat) and populations
   exhibit morphologies that are best suited for capturing locally
   available prey. We explored how variation in diet correlates with
   habitat type, and how these factors influence key morphological
   structures (mouth gape, eye diameter, fin length, fin area, and pectoral
   fin ratio) in a common microcarnivorous cryptic reef fish species, the
   triplefin Helcogrammoides cunninghami. In a mensurative experiment
   carried out at six kelp-dominated sites, we observed considerable
   differences in diet along 400km of the Chilean coast coincident with
   variation in habitat availability and prey distributions. Triplefins
   preferred a single prey type (bivalves or barnacles) at northern sites,
   coincident with a low diversity of foraging habitats. In contrast,
   southern sites presented varied and heterogeneous habitats, where
   triplefin diets were more diverse and included amphipods, decapods, and
   cumaceans. Allometry-corrected results indicated that some morphological
   structures were consistently correlated with different prey items.
   Specifically, large mouth gape was associated with the capture of highly
   mobile prey such as decapods, while small mouth gape was more associated
   with cumaceans and copepods. In contrast, triplefins that capture
   sessile prey such as hydroids tend to have larger eyes. Therefore,
   morphological structures co-vary with habitat selection and prey usage
   in this species. Our study shows how an abundant generalist reef fish

Abstract = {{The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased in most
   countries the last decades. Considering this in a simplistic way, we can
   say that obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and
   energy expenditure. Moreover, the environment from conception to
   childhood could influence the child's future health. The first 1000 days
   of life start with woman's pregnancy, and offer a unique window of
   opportunity to contribute to obesity prevention. In light of the actual
   literature, the aim of our article is to discuss a proposal of 10 good
   practices to minimize obesity in the first 1000 days emerging from
   published science. (1) Both the mother's and the father's behaviors are
   important. A balanced diet with appropriate fat and protein intake, and
   favoring fruits and vegetables, is recommended for both parents during
   the conception period and pregnancy. Furthermore, overweight obese women
   who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their weight before
   conception. (2) During pregnancy, at birth, and during early life, body
   composition measurements are crucial to monitor the baby's growth. (3)
   Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended at the beginning of life until
   six months of age. (4) Four to six months of age is the optimal window
   to introduce complementary feeding. Until one year of age, breast milk
   or follow-on commercial formula is the main recommended feeding source,
   and cow's milk should be avoided until one year of age. (5) Fruit and
   vegetable introduction should begin early. Daily variety, diversity in a
   meal, and repeated exposure to the food, up to eight times, are
   efficient strategies to increase acceptance of food not well accepted at
   first. There is no need to add sugar, salt, or sugary fluids to the
   diet. (6) Respect the child's appetite and avoid coercive ``clean your
   plate{''} feeding practices. Adapt the portion of food and don't use
   food as reward for good behavior. (7) Limit animal protein intake in
   early life to reduce the risk of an early adiposity rebound. Growing-up
   milk for children between one and three years of age should be preferred
   to cow's milk, in order to limit intake and meet essential fatty acid
   and iron needs. (8) The intake of adequate fat containing essential
   fatty acids should be promoted. (9) Parents should be role models when
   feeding, with TV and other screens turned-off during meals. (10)
   Preventive interventions consisting of promoting physical activity and
   sufficient time dedicated to sleep should be employed. In fact, short
   sleep duration may be associated with increased risk of developing
   obesity. Based on literature reviews, and given the suggestions
   described in this manuscript, concerted public health efforts are needed
   to achieve the healthy objectives for obesity and nutrition, and to
   fight the childhood obesity epidemic.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolism, behaviour and growth are highly flexible in fish species,
   and inter-individual variation in these traits is evolutionarily and
   ecologically significant. It has long been suggested that these traits
   co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study,
   we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential
   relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid
   carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard
   metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e.
   activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and
   after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a
   day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group
   showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed
   fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing.
   Compared with the once-fed group, the twice-fed group showed higher
   feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar
   specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was
   affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and
   exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the
   group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in
   the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality
   traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with
   FE and/or SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the
   twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that
   food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and
   ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between
   metabolism and growth.}},

Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Excess dietary fructose intake associated with metabolic
   syndrome and insulin resistance and increased risk of developing type 2
   diabetes. Previous animal studies have reported that diabetic animals
   have significantly impaired behavioural and cognitive functions,
   pathological synaptic function and impaired expression of glutamate
   receptors. Correction of the antioxidant status of laboratory rodents
   largely prevents the development of fructose-induced plurimetabolic
   changes in the nervous system. We suggest a novel concept of efficiency
   of Stevia leaves for treatment of central diabetic neuropathy.
   Methods: By in vivo extracellular studies induced spike activity of
   hippocampal neurons during high frequency stimulation of entorhinal
   cortex, as well as neurons of basolateral amygdala to high-frequency
   stimulation of the hippocampus effects of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni
   plant evaluated in synaptic activity in the brain of fructose-enriched
   diet rats. In the conditions of metabolic disorders caused by fructose,
   antioxidant activity of Stevia rebaudiana was assessed by measuring the
   NOX activity of the hippocampus, amygdala and spinal cord.
   Results: In this study, the characteristic features of the metabolic
   effects of dietary fructose on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal
   neurons and basolateral amygdala and the state of the NADPH oxidase
   (NOX) oxidative system of these brain formations are revealed, as well
   as the prospects for development of multitarget and polyfunctional
   phytopreparations (with adaptogenic, antioxidant, antidiabetic,
   nootropic activity) from native raw material of Stevia rebaudiana.
   Stevia modulates degree of expressiveness of potentiation/depression
   (approaches but fails to achieve the norm) by shifting the percentage
   balance in favor of depressor type of responses during high-frequency
   stimulation, indicating its adaptogenic role in plasticity of neural
   networks. Under the action of fructose an increase (3-5 times) in
   specific quantity of total fraction of NOX isoforms isolated from the
   central nervous system tissue (amygdala, hippocampus, spinal cord) was
   revealed. Stevia exhibits an antistress, membrane-stabilizing role
   reducing the level of total fractions of NOX isoforms from central
   nervous system tissues and regulates NADPH-dependent O-2(-) producing
   activity.
   Conclusion: Generally, in condition of metabolic disorders caused by
   intensive consumption of dietary fructose Stevia leaves contributes to
   the control of neuronal synaptic plasticity possibly influencing the
   conjugated NOX-specific targets.}},

Title = {{Intraindividual Behavioral Variability Predicts Foraging Outcome in a
   Beach-dwelling Jumping Spider}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent differences between
   individuals in behavior, has been the subject of hundreds if not
   thousands of papers. However, little work explores the fitness
   consequences of variation in behavior within individuals, or
   intraindividual variability (IIV). We probe the effects of behavioral
   IIV on predator-prey interaction outcomes in beach-dwelling jumping
   spiders (Terralonus californicus). Prior studies have found that spiders
   with higher body condition (body mass relative to size) behave more
   variably. Thus, we hypothesized that jumping spider activity level IIV
   would relate positively to foraging performance. To address this, we
   tested for associations between activity IIV, average activity level,
   and two measures of foraging success in laboratory mesocosms: change in
   spider mass and the number of prey killed. Activity IIV positively
   correlated with the mass that spiders gained from prey, but not with the
   number of prey killed. This suggests that spiders with high IIV consumed
   a greater proportion of their prey or used less energy. Interestingly,
   average activity level (personality) predicted neither metric of
   foraging success, indicating that behavioral IIV can predict metrics of
   success that personality does not. Therefore, our findings suggest that
   IIV should be considered alongside personality in studies of
   predator-prey interactions.}},

   were examined. Correlational analyses between the CFNS and children's
   eating habits, food preferences and temperament dimensions were run. The
   results support a two-factor solution, suggesting two opposite
   dimensions: Food Neophobia and Food Neophilia. Invariance analysis
   showed the same structure for both age groups (2- to 4 vs. 5- to 6-year
   old), although only partial metric invariance across sex groups was
   attained. For both Food Neophobia and Food Neophilia subscales, good
   internal consistency and excellent test retest reliability were
   achieved, as well as a moderate negative association between the two
   groups, of items. Higher scores in Food Neophobia and lower scores in
   Food Neophilia were significantly correlated with a more inhibited
   temperament, lower preference for healthy foods, acceptance of fewer
   foods, less frequent consumption of healthy foods, and consumption of a
   smaller variety of fruits, vegetables and legumes. Children's unhealthy
   food intake was not associated with both CNFS subscales. Our preliminary
   findings support the adequacy of this version of CFNS for the Portuguese
   population. Further studies are needed to confirm the two-dimensional
   structure of the scale and explore the implications of this structure.

Abstract = {{Food addiction is characterized by poorly controlled intake of
   highly-palatable, calorically-dense, foods. While previous studies
   indicate that risk factors for food addiction are similar to substance
   use disorders (SUD), these studies have looked at food addiction and SUD
   in independent samples, limiting the ability to directly compare food
   addiction to SUD. The present study was conducted to assess rates of
   post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, childhood and adult
   trauma exposure, as well as presence and severity of emotion
   dysregulation, in a sample of women (N = 229) who either meet criteria
   for no addiction, food addiction only or SUD only. The prevalence of
   food addiction was 183\% and the prevalence of SUD was 30.6\% in this
   sample. Women with food addiction and women with SUD endorsed more
   depression and PTSD symptoms when compared with individuals with no
   addiction. Individuals with food addiction and SUD had higher total
   emotion dysregulation scores, specifically with difficulties in goal
   directed behaviors, non-acceptance of emotional responses, impulse
   control, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of
   emotional clarity, when compared to individuals with no addiction (all
   p's < 0.05). There were no differences in PTSD and depression symptoms
   and emotion dysregulation scores between food addiction and SUD groups
   (all p > 0.05). However, women with SUD endorsed higher levels of
   total:childhood (p < 0.01) and adulthood trauma (p < 0.01) as compared
   with women with no addiction or food addiction. These results suggest
   that women with food addiction and those with SUD share similar
   psychological characteristics and risk factors, with the exception of
   trauma histories. These findings have implications for the detection of
   risk for and treatment of these disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Childhood obesity/overweight (OB/OW) displayed a rapid increase and high
   prevalence in the last few decades in preschool-aged children, which
   raised health concerns across the world and motivated researchers to
   investigate the factors that underlie childhood obesity. The current
   study examined parenting styles and child-feeding practices as potential
   predictors for OB/OW in preschool children, controlling for child's
   temperament, which has been shown to be linked with OB/OW. The sample
   included 61 normal weight (NW) and 61 obese/overweight (OB/OW) Turkish
   pre-schoolers (M age = 62.2 months; SD = 7.64, range = 45-80 months).
   Parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative), child-feeding practices
   (restriction, pressure to eat, monitoring), and child's temperament
   (negative affectivity) were measured with mothers' reports. Results
   showed that authoritarian parenting and maternal pressure to eat were
   the two parenting variables that significantly predicted child's weight
   status; the odds of being OB/OW was 4.71 times higher in children whose
   mothers used higher authoritarian parenting style, and was 0.44 times
   lower when mothers pressured their child to eat. These findings suggest
   that understanding the unique role of different aspects of parenting in
   the risk of early OB/OW status of children would be important in
   developing more effective interventions from early years in life. (C)

Abstract = {{Throughout the animal kingdom, individual variation in reproductive
   success is commonly observed, even under similar environmental
   conditions. However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain
   unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed
   rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand
   among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have
   highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding
   success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual
   behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per
   behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding
   seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay,
   South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in
   penguins' nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian
   approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the
   trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in
   African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (bold,
   mobile) or risk-averse (shy, non-mobile). We then assessed their
   breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4weeks in 2015
   and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to
   nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly
   influence birds' breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most
   successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially
   apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher
   energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents
   grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend
   their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression
   when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food
   availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context
   of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent,
   risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be
   reduced in African penguins.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{85-92}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Supplemental feeding, whether intentional or accidental, alters wildlife
   foraging behaviors and may have consequences at the population and
   ecosystem levels. Wildlife feeding may also cause animals to develop
   aggressive behaviors toward conspecifics and people. The risks to humans
   is potentially accrued when the species is a native predator. Food-based
   attraction has been implicated in the development of human-directed
   aggression in the dingo (Canis lupus dingo) population on Fraser Island,
   Queensland, Australia. Management strategies such as education programs,
   prohibition of inappropriate human behaviors, and fencing of garbage
   dumps have been implemented to stop the (intentional or inadvertent)
   feeding of dingoes by people. Despite these efforts, dingoes continue to
   obtain human-sourced food, suggesting that other means of supplemental
   feeding are still available. One possible source of subsidized food is
   recreational fishing, which is a popular activity on the island. We
   conducted a quasi-experimental study during May-June 2014 of dingo
   foraging behaviors on the eastern beach of Fraser Island. We
   video-recorded the behaviors of lone and groups of dingoes when they
   were in the vicinity of anglers or by themselves. We hypothesized that
   if recreational fishing was a source of subsidies to dingoes, then there
   would be differences in dingo foraging behavior among the 2 groups. We
   found that in the absence of anglers, dingoes spent 81\% of their time
   engaged in mobile food-related behaviors. When anglers were present,
   however, they spent 52\% of their time sitting and resting. These
   results suggest that dingoes shifted from active searching to a sit and
   wait foraging mode upon detecting recreational anglers. We observed an
   event in which a dingo spent 2hours resting near an angler, then dug up
   the fish remains buried by the man as soon as he had left the area. This
   and other anecdotal evidence support the view that the changes in dingo
   foraging activity detected in this study were related to increased
   opportunities to secure food from anglers. Recreational fishing may play
   an important role in the inadvertent subsidizing of dingoes on Fraser
   Island, although further investigations are needed before proposing and
   implementing additional conservation and management actions. (c) 2017
   The Wildlife Society.
   We demonstrate that dingoes on Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia,
   alter their locomotor and foraging behaviors in the presence of anglers.
   We advocate for further research in the role of recreational fishing in
   the development of negative dingo-human interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Life history theory integrates ecological, physiological, and molecular
   layers within an evolutionary framework to understand organisms'
   strategies to optimize survival and reproduction. Two life history
   hypotheses and their implications for child growth, development, and
   health (illustrated in the South African context) are reviewed here. One
   hypothesis suggests that there is an energy trade-off between linear
   growth and brain growth. Undernutrition in infancy and childhood may
   trigger adaptive physiological mechanisms prioritizing the brain at the
   expense of body growth. Another hypothesis is that the period from
   conception to infancy is a critical window of developmental plasticity
   of linear growth, the duration of which may vary between and within
   populations. The transition from infancy to childhood may mark the end
   of a critical window of opportunity for improving child growth. Both
   hypotheses emphasize the developmental plasticity of linear growth and
   the potential determinants of growth variability (including the role of
   parent-offspring conflict in maternal resources allocation).
   Implications of these hypotheses in populations with high burdens of
   undernutrition and infections are discussed. In South Africa, HIV/AIDS
   during pregnancy (associated with adverse birth outcomes, short duration
   of breastfeeding, and social consequences) may lead to a shortened
   window of developmental plasticity of growth. Furthermore,
   undernutrition and infectious diseases in children living in South
   Africa, a country undergoing a rapid nutrition transition, may have
   adverse consequences on individuals' cognitive abilities and risks of
   cardio-metabolic diseases. Studies are needed to identify physiological
   mechanisms underlying energy allocation between biological functions and
   their potential impacts on health.}},

Abstract = {{Because both predation risk and resource quality have a pivotal role in
   ecological communities, their combined effects were assessed in stream

   subtentaculata, a caddisfly shredder Sericostoma vittatum, a dipteran
   collector Chironomus riparius, native alder Alnus glutinosa and invasive
   eucalypt Eucalyptus globulus. We investigated whether individual

   whether the response can be mediated by resource quality. We also
   assessed whether shredder-collector interactions are altered under these

   decomposition and C. riparius growth independently. Chironomus riparius
   fed preferentially on alders, resulting in increased growth rate. Litter
   processing decreased under planarian presence, in both leaf types,
   impairing the growth of C. riparius larvae, this effect being
   exacerbated with eucalypts. Chironomus riparius growth was also reduced
   in the presence of the caddisfly, suggesting competition between these
   species, irrespective of planarian presence, but dependent on leaf type.
   The present study highlighted the importance of assessing predator

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{57-68}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For social foragers, movement as a group could increase foraging
   efficiency through collective discovery of high-quality food sources.
   This would require an efficient mechanism for transferring information
   about food quality between individuals. Conversely, the constraints of
   foraging as a cohesive group could decrease efficiency; grouping may
   persist to serve other functions such as protection from predators. To
   test what drives cohesion in herbivores, we manipulated patch shape and
   within-patch pattern of food quality and quantified the effects on group
   level diet selection by a social herbivore, the fallow deer, Dama dama.
   We arranged feeders containing fodder in lines or blocks, and
   manipulated the pattern of food quality within patches by adding tannin,
   a plant secondary compound that decreases palatability. We quantified
   the relative consumption of low- and high-tannin food to compare diet
   selectivity at the group level between patch treatments. If group
   foraging evolved to increase foraging efficiency, altering the spatial
   arrangement of food should not affect diet selectivity because
   information about food location and quality is shared. We found,
   however, that the herd expressed different levels of selectivity between
   both patch shapes and food quality patterns. Deer selected better diets
   in blocks than lines. In lines, the herd selected better diets when
   quality varied between alternate feeders rather than between the two
   halves of the patch, suggesting a reliance on personal rather than group
   information. Deer consumed the most at patch centres in all treatments
   except in blocks with high-tannin centres, but diet selection was poorer
   in the latter compared to blocks with low-tannin centres. Aggregation at
   the centre of patches appears to have restricted exploitation of the
   best food. Predation pressure and/or resource variability may have
   favoured the evolution of a foraging strategy that prioritizes social
   cohesion over effective diet selection. (C) 2017 The Association for the

   learning from the mistakes of others?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{85-96}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Learning by observing others has been acknowledged as a powerful
   learning strategy. Whereas in several species observation of fear
   conditioning or other operational procedures can improve subsequent
   performance during actual learning, much less attention has been paid to
   observational learning of spatial discrimination tasks. To this end, we
   developed a set of procedures in which the spatial memory of adult rats,
   Rattus norvegicus, was tested in an eight-arm radial maze. Moreover, in
   view of controversial information concerning the incidence of mistakes
   made by demonstrators on the effectiveness of observational learning,
   our observer rats watched experienced or nontrained demonstrators.
   Food-deprived observers and demonstrators were initially habituated to
   the maze with all arms baited. Then observers were placed in a mesh cage
   positioned above the maze while a demonstrator rat was locating the
   spatial position of three baited arms. Rats observing conspecifics
   progressively learning the spatial discrimination improved subsequent
   performance compared to a control group watching an empty maze, but only
   if the configuration of baited arms presented during demonstration and
   testing matched. Therefore, rats integrated relevant spatial information
   during observation and used it efficiently when their spatial
   discrimination was tested in the maze. However, when the information was
   provided by trained demonstrators, making no mistakes and visiting only
   baited arms, observer rats failed to exhibit improved performance.
   Nevertheless, when given an initial habituation without food rewards,
   rats were subsequently able to benefit from observation of trained
   demonstrators thus showing that watching mistakes was not necessary for
   successful observational learning. Together, these findings indicate
   that rats can acquire spatial information via observation enabling more
   pertinent search strategies during testing and that for observation to
   be beneficial, what is observed must be sufficiently relevant or novel
   to complement existing knowledge ( here initial habituation with or
   without rewards). (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Seasonal variation in food resources and predation risk imposes major
   constraints on herbivores, which must adjust their behaviour to maximize
   their energy intake and survival. In seasonally driven landscapes, it is
   not yet clear what the primary drivers are that shape seasonal variation
   in vigilance and feeding rates. These rates have been shown to vary in
   relation to various environmental, social and individual factors, but
   many of these factors also vary through the year, due to variation in
   food supply. We studied wild female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus
   giganteus, under low predation risk over a year to investigate whether
   vigilance and feeding rates varied seasonally and whether this variation
   was mainly driven by food quantity or quality, group size or
   individuals' reproductive states. Both vigilance and feeding rates
   varied seasonally, as did food quantity and quality and group size.
   Vigilance, including antipredator (head orientation away from the group)
   and exclusive (i.e. vigilance without chewing) vigilance, decreased and
   feeding rate increased with increasing group size. However, because
   group size increased with food quality and quantity, food resources
   emerged as the primary driver of variation in behavioural strategies.
   These results suggest that the observed effects of group size on the
   trade-off between food acquisition and safety are in fact corollaries of
   the seasonal variation in food supply in our study system, in which the
   risk of predation on adults is low, and hence are by-products of the
   foraging choices made by kangaroos in response to the dynamics of the
   quantity and quality of food. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Biologging technologies are changing the way in which the marine
   environment is observed and monitored. However, because device retrieval
   is typically required to access the high-resolution data they collect,
   their use is generally restricted to those animals that predictably
   return to land. Data abstraction and transmission techniques aim to
   address this, although currently these are limited in scope and do not
   incorporate, for example, acceleration measurements which can quantify
   animal behaviours and movement patterns over fine-scales. In this study,
   we present a new method for the collection, abstraction and transmission
   of accelerometer data from free-ranging marine predators via the Argos
   satellite system. We test run the technique on 20 juvenile southern
   elephant seals Mirounga leonina from the Kerguelen Islands during their
   first months at sea following weaning. Using retrieved archival data
   from nine individuals that returned to the colony, we compare and
   validate abstracted transmissions against outputs from established
   accelerometer processing procedures. Abstracted transmissions included
   estimates, across five segments of a dive profile, of time spent in prey
   catch attempt (PrCA) behaviours, swimming effort and pitch. These were
   then summarised and compared to archival outputs across three dive
   phases: descent, bottom and ascent. Correlations between the two
   datasets were variable but generally good (dependent on dive phase,
   marginal R-2 values of between .45 and .6 to>.9) and consistent between
   individuals. Transmitted estimates of PrCA behaviours and swimming
   effort were positively biased to those from archival processing. Data
   from this study represent some of the first remotely transmitted
   quantifications from accelerometers. The methods presented and analysed
   can be used to provide novel insight towards the behaviours and
   movements of free-ranging marine predators, such as juvenile southern
   elephant seals, from whom logger retrieval is challenging. Future
   applications could however benefit from some adaption, particularly to
   reduce positive bias in transmitted PrCA behaviours and swimming effort,
   for which this study provides useful insight.}},

Title = {{Behavioural responses to infrasonic particle acceleration in cuttlefish}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Attacks by aquatic predators generate frontal water disturbances
   characterised by low-frequency gradients in pressure and particle
   motion. Low-frequency hearing is highly developed in cephalopods. Thus,
   we examined behavioural responses in juvenile cuttlefish to infrasonic
   accelerations mimicking main aspects of the hydrodynamic signals created
   by predators. In the experimental set-up, animals and their surrounding
   water moved as a unit to minimise lateral line activation and to allow
   examination of the contribution by the inner ear. Behavioural responses
   were tested in light versus darkness and after food deprivation
   following a `simulated' hunting opportunity. At low acceleration levels,
   colour change threshold at 3, 5 and 9 Hz was 0.028, 0.038 and 0.035 m
   s(-2), respectively. At higher stimulus levels, jet-propulsed escape
   responses thresholds in daylight were 0.043, 0.065 and 0.069 m s(-2) at
   3, 5 and 9 Hz, respectively, and not significantly different from the
   corresponding darkness thresholds of 0.043, 0.071 and 0.064 m s(-2). In
   a simulated hunting mode, escape thresholds were significantly higher at
   3 Hz (0.118 m s(-2)) but not at 9 Hz (0.134 m s(-2)). Escape responses
   were directional, and overall followed the direction of the initial
   particle acceleration, with mean escape angles from 313 to 33 deg for
   all three experiments. Thus, in the wild, particle acceleration might
   cause escape responses directed away from striking predators but towards
   suction-feeding predators. We suggest that cuttlefish jet-propulsed
   escape behaviour has evolved to be elicited by the early hydrodynamic
   disturbances generated during predator encounters, and that the inner
   ear plays an essential role in the acoustic escape responses.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Winter is an ecologically challenging season for ectothermic cold-water
   fish in natural streams because of reduced flow and freezing. Hydropower
   regulation in many northern rivers increase winter stream flow and
   temperatures, and reduce ice formation and surface ice cover. From a
   background review of knowledge about e.g. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   and brown trout (Salmo trutta) winter survival strategies, we explore
   responses to hydropower impacts as a basis for adaptive management,
   mitigating strategies, and future research. Winter intensity and
   duration, hydrologic conditions and channel characteristics drive
   complex ice processes which become more complex and pervasive in
   smaller, high-gradient streams. Stream ice formation may be divided into
   the dynamic period `freeze-up' in early winter with sub-surface ice,
   more stable `mid-winter' with surface ice, and the ecologically
   challenging `ice break-up' in winter-spring with potential mechanical
   ice runs and scouring. The characteristics of periods vary depending on
   climate and hydropower regulation. In reaches downstream of power-plant
   outlets water temperature may increase and reduce surface ice formation.
   The mid-winter period destabilize or become absent. In bypass reaches
   flows decrease and facilitate freezing and ice production. Knowledge
   about longitudinal water temperature changes is limited. Hydro-peaked
   systems may aggravate high-low flow effects. A basic winter survival
   strategy in salmon and trout is energy storage, but also reduced
   metabolism, tolerance and starvation effected by quiescence. Energy
   storage may depend on local conditions, but there is little indication
   of adaptation to local thermal climates. Intraspecific phenotypic
   plasticity is important. The main behavioural strategy is risk-reducing
   sheltering in the substratum or deep areas, and nocturnal activity.
   Local movements between daytime refuges and nighttime slow-current
   activity areas are usually limited to meters. Larger fish may move more
   and aggregate in restricted suitable deep-slow refuge habitats such as
   pools and deep glides. Fish cope with ordinary thermal ice phenomena,
   and do not appear to become trapped in ice. Surface ice may reduce fish
   metabolism, but other factors, e.g. availability of substrate shelter,
   may override this effect. Mechanical ice break-ups and less surface ice
   may reduce survival. An adaptive mitigating strategy may be higher
   regulated flows in winter which increase rearing and/or resting habitat
   and survival, but studies are few and knowledge is limited. However,
   higher regulated flows also affect temperature regime. Low flows
   increase ice formation, reduce and fragment available habitat, and may
   reduce egg and fish survival. Influx of ground water may mitigate these
   impacts, as will stabilize minimum flows. Sudden drops in regulated
   water discharge should be avoided. Fish may strand, in particular at low
   temperatures in the daytime when fish are less mobile and seek shelter.
   The challenging winter season is understudied, and important management
   considerations and future research areas for better adaptive management
   are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Late arrival on the breeding grounds has been associated with reduced
   fitness in migratory birds. Because migratory stopover accounts for the
   majority of time spent on migration, how individuals respond to both
   exogenous and endogenous factors associated with stopover will influence
   the pace of migration and arrival timing on the breeding grounds. Among
   the most important endogenous factors, body condition (i.e. fat stores)
   is expected to influence both movement behavior and departure decisions
   of individual migrants during stopover. In a novel experiment, we
   manipulated the condition of after-second-year (adult) male American
   Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured during spring migratory
   stopover and radio-tracked all individuals after release using a passive
   automated telemetry array and conventional hand tracking. After
   accounting for the positive effect of tailwind and capture date on
   departure probability, we demonstrated that body condition influenced
   both the movement behavior of individuals and stopover duration.
   Individual movement decreased throughout the stopover period at a rate
   of 0.7 km day(-1), supporting the notion that birds progressively limit
   their movements as stopover progresses. However, treatment birds whose
   condition was experimentally reduced (i.e. food-restricted) exhibited
   similar to 3.4 times greater daily movement rates, and control birds
   were 4 times more likely to depart on a given day than treatment birds.
   These results underscore the importance of energetic condition in
   mediating the movement and stopover dynamics of migratory birds.
   Further, despite their capacity to make behavioral adjustments, our
   results suggest migratory songbirds that experience decreases in body
   condition during migration (which could result from inclement weather or
   low-quality stopover habitat) are likely to be delayed in their arrival
   on the breeding grounds, which could lower reproductive performance and
   ultimately have population-level ramifications.}},

Abstract = {{Many prey species detect predators through chemoreception, particularly
   in low-visibility aquatic environments. Moreover, injury-released
   chemical cues from conspecifics are often perceived as a reliable
   indicator of predation threat. We examined whether males of the
   freshwater caridean shrimp Palaemon argentinus (Nobili, 1901) react to
   different types of infochemicals associated with predation threat.
   Shrimp were exposed to chemical stimuli from starved individuals of a
   predatory fish (Australoheros facetus (Jenyns, 1842)) and from crushed
   conspecific shrimp. Our experiment showed that P. argentinus reacts to
   waterborne substances associated with predation threat, indicating that
   chemical cues mediate behavioural antipredator responses. Shrimp adopted
   an appropriate antipredator behaviour (reduced swimming activity) in
   response to chemical stimuli from A. facetus, and from crushed
   conspecifics, relative to a distilled-water control. The chemical
   stimuli from crushed conspecifics elicited the strongest reduction in
   swimming activity. Reduced movement, a common response in prey animals
   to the presence of predators, was not entirely consistent because shrimp
   increased their walking time in response to the chemical stimuli that
   were investigated. The ability to alter behaviour based on
   vision-independent perception of ambient risk would be highly useful for
   macroinvertebrate prey species such as P. argentinus living in eutrophic
   shallow lakes where visibility is often reduced. Our results
   demonstrated chemosensory recognition of predation risk highlighting the
   important role of chemical cues in the behavioural ecology of this
   shrimp, especially with regards to predator-prey interactions.}},

   Individuals across four natural populations were tested for general

   with a population from high-predation habitat being bolder than

   higher tendencies than females to associate with a conspecific shoal in

   Individual body size had a strong effect on the activity-boldness

Abstract = {{The embodied mammalian brain evolved to adapt to an only partially known
   and knowable world. The adaptive labeling of the world is critically
   dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of
   subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the
   amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of
   classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the
   world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined
   discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning
   progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies
   the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and
   then forms the association of the current sensory state with a
   particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency.
   This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory
   components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while
   its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output
   systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical
   systems that underlie this feature detection process and its
   state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream
   target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the
   role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the
   regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of
   sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator
   acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala,
   plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their
   associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory
   features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the
   adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the
   switching between modes of attention and learning.}},

Abstract = {{For marine top predators like seabirds, the oceans represent a multitude
   of habitats regarding oceanographic conditions and food availability.
   Worldwide, these marine habitats are being altered by changes in climate
   and increased anthropogenic impact. This is causing a growing concern on
   how seabird populations might adapt to these changes. Understanding how
   seabird populations respond to fluctuating environmental conditions and
   to what extent behavioral flexibility can buffer variations in food
   availability can help predict how seabirds may cope with changes in the
   marine environment. Such knowledge is important to implement proper
   long-term conservation measures intended to protect marine predators. We
   explored behavioral flexibility in choice of foraging habitat of
   chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla during multiple
   years. By comparing foraging behavior of individuals from two colonies
   with large differences in oceanographic conditions and distances to
   predictable feeding areas at the Norwegian shelf break, we investigated
   how foraging decisions are related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   We found that proximity to the shelf break determined which factors
   drove the decision to forage there. At the colony near the shelf break,
   time of departure from the colony and wind speed were most important in
   driving the choice of habitat. At the colony farther from the shelf
   break, the decision to forage there was driven by adult body condition.
   Birds furthermore adjusted foraging behavior metrics according to time
   of the day, weather conditions, body condition, and the age of the
   chicks. The study shows that kittiwakes have high degree of flexibility
   in their behavioral response to a variable marine environment, which
   might help them buffer changes in prey distribution around the colonies.
   The flexibility is, however, dependent on the availability of foraging
   habitats near the colony.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{961-972}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Indirect risk effects of predators on prey behavior can have more of an
   impact on prey populations than direct consumptive effects. Predation
   risk can elicit more vigilance behavior in prey, reducing the amount of
   time available for other activities, such as foraging, which could
   potentially reduce foraging efficiency. Understanding the conditions
   associated with predation risk and the specific effects predation risk
   have on prey behavior is important because it has direct influences on
   the profitability of food items found under various conditions and
   states of the forager. The goals of this study were to assess how ducks
   perceived predation risk in various habitat types and how strongly
   perceived risk versus energetic demand affected foraging behavior. We
   manipulated food abundance in different wetland types in Illinois, USA
   to reduce confounding between food abundance and vegetation structure.
   We conducted focal-animal behavioral samples on five duck species in
   treatment and control plots and used generalized linear mixed-effects
   models to compare the effects of vegetation structure versus other
   factors on the intensity with which ducks fed and the duration of
   feeding stints. Mallards fed more intensively and, along with
   blue-winged teal, used longer feeding stints in open habitats,
   consistent with the hypothesis that limited visibility was perceived to
   have a greater predation risk than unlimited visibility. The species
   temporally nearest to nesting, wood ducks, were willing to take more
   risks for a greater food reward, consistent with an increase in a
   marginal value of energy as they approached nesting. Our results
   indicate that some duck species value energy differently based on the
   surrounding vegetation structure and density. Furthermore, increases in
   the marginal value of energy can be more influential than perceived risk
   in shaping foraging behavior patterns. Based on these findings, we
   conclude that the value of various food items is not solely determined
   by energy contained in the item but by conditions in which it is found
   and the state of the forager.}},

Abstract = {{Frailty, a critical intermediate status of the aging process that is at
   increased risk for negative health-related events, includes physical,
   cognitive, and psychosocial domains or phenotypes. Cognitive frailty is
   a condition recently defined by operationalized criteria describing
   coexisting physical frailty and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with
   two proposed subtypes: potentially reversible cognitive frailty
   (physical frailty/MCI) and reversible cognitive frailty (physical
   frailty/pre- MCI subjective cognitive decline). In the present article,
   we reviewed the framework for the definition, different models, and the
   current epidemiology of cognitive frailty, also describing
   neurobiological mechanisms, and exploring the possible prevention of the
   cognitive frailty progression. Several studies suggested a relevant
   heterogeneity with prevalence estimates ranging 1.0-22.0\% (10.7-22.0\%
   in clinical-based settings and 1.0-4.4\% in population-based settings).
   Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies showed that
   different cognitive frailty models may be associated with increased risk
   of functional disability, worsened quality of life, hospitalization,
   mortality, incidence of dementia, vascular dementia, and neurocognitive
   disorders. The operationalization of clinical constructs based on
   cognitive impairment related to physical causes (physical frailty, motor
   function decline, or other physical factors) appears to be interesting
   for dementia secondary prevention given the increased risk for
   progression to dementia of these clinical entities. Multidomain
   interventions have the potential to be effective in preventing cognitive
   frailty. In the near future, we need to establish more reliable clinical
   and research criteria, using different operational definitions for
   frailty and cognitive impairment, and useful clinical, biological, and
   imaging markers to implement intervention programs targeted to improve
   frailty, so preventing also late-life cognitive disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers have evolved from scavengers of necessity to scavengers of
   excess. Citizens of industrialized countries have little survival
   motivation to forage for food, yet a dominance of food cues in the

   strategies are needed to mediate these negative effects. However,
   healthful consumption likelihood has been an extremely elusive measure
   to predict. Most studies are able to show only an incremental amount of
   variance explained in consumers' behavioral intentions. Moreover,
   generalizability is often limited to college student data. In response,
   the present research uses structural equation modeling methods to
   investigate the complexity of this domain. The results from a
   representative panel of U.S. adult consumers show that motivation,
   social support, and food features all have significant effects on
   healthful consumption likelihood. Finally, several of these effects are
   mediated by the importance of healthy eating and convenience barriers.

   revealed the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the dyads located on
   the porphyrin units, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
   located on the perylene units. In addition, these results were in
   agreement with that of the theoretical modeling. When excited at 423 or
   473 nm, the photoluminescent emission spectra showed that the degree of
   fluorescence quenching of porphyrin units increased as the spacers
   became shorter. This quenching was ascribed to intramolecular
   photoinduced electron transfer, which also induced the dyad molecules to
   form the charge-separated states. The charge-separated molecules were
   further confirmed by the photocurrent response curves. These behaviors
   of broad absorption of the ultraviolet-visible light, yielding the
   charge-separated states of the molecules when excited and the formation
   of columnar liquid crystal phase made these dyads candidates for
   single-component photovoltaic active materials.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of death among women
   worldwide. Identification of susceptible women might help us reduce
   BC-related deaths. Traditionally women's susceptibility to BC has been
   estimated based on family, reproductive and nutritional histories and/or
   genotyping. Unfortunately, predictions made based on all these factors
   remain imprecise. Research conducted over the past decades supports the
   premise that patients displaying some personality traits are prone to
   develop cancer. Nevertheless, conflicting results have been published.
   We then conducted a study aimed at evaluating relationships between
   specific personality traits and different types of breast pathology.
   This approach aimed at evaluating whether personality profiling, in
   conjunction with other parameters might help us, in the near future, to
   identify more accurately Mexican women susceptible to develop BC. As a
   first step towards this goal, we asked whether healthy women and
   patients having signs of benign breast pathology or cancer shared or not
   specific personality traits. We used the Courtauld Emotional Control
   Total Score, the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory and the Symptoms of
   Stress Inventory to identify personality traits. Our results indicated
   that women diagnosed with benign or malign breast pathology share low
   restraint, low global stress symptoms, low physical stress symptoms, low
   restraint-defensiveness composite and high distress before diagnosis.
   This outcome was independent of the educational level, as well as of
   family, reproductive and nutritional histories, supporting that the
   weight of the psychological traits is greater than that of the latter
   variables, at least in our sample.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-87}},
Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective force that affects prey population and
   ecosystem dynamics. Detecting predators and associated levels of threat
   is crucial to prey responses. Once a predator is detected,
   anti-predatory responses improve the chances of survival of prey. We
   used Aedes aegypti larvae to study behavioural responses to predation
   threat from guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we tested the
   relative importance of chemical cues, both in isolation and in
   combination with physical cues, in eliciting anti-predatory behaviours.
   Larvae responded more strongly, by reducing the lengths of their wriggle
   bursts, when presented with a combination of chemical and physical cues
   than with chemical cues alone. Anti-predatory responses often come with
   an associated cost, and we expect that the ability to pay these costs
   should influence responses to predation risk. To test this, we compared
   wriggling patterns of satiated vs starved larvae in the same experiment.
   We found that, under predation risk, starved larvae were willing to take
   more risks than satiated larvae were. We sought to experimentally test
   the assumption that anti-predator behaviours increase the survival of
   prey. To do this, starved guppies were made to choose between displays
   of simulated larvae, moving in short and long wriggle bursts as observed
   in the previous experiment. The fish preferentially attacked larvae
   moving in long bursts, demonstrating the survival value of the larval
   anti-predatory response of shifting to a preponderance of short wriggle
   bursts. Our study identifies specific ways in which trade-offs between
   predation risk and energetic costs could affect anti-predator behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study tested hypotheses drawn from a risk model positing
   that psychosocial risk plus disease-related and treatment factors
   contribute to bulimic symptoms in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
   transitioning to an insulin pump. The goal of this study was to examine
   whether disease-related factors, particularly disease-and
   treatment-based disruption in hunger and satiety, contribute to report
   of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D after accounting for psychosocial
   risk factors. Methods 43 youth (ages 10-17, 54\% female) with
   established T1D were recruited before transition from multiple daily
   injections to insulin-pump therapy from three tertiary pediatric
   diabetes centers. Participants completed measures of bulimic symptoms,
   depressive symptoms dietary restraint, and the Diabetes Treatment and
   Satiety Scale, a diabetes-specific questionnaire assessing hunger and
   satiety cues and eating behavior in response to blood glucose levels and
   treatment. Results Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess
   contributions of psychosocial and disease-based risk to report of
   bulimic symptoms. After assessing the contributions of body mass index,
   body image dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint, a significant 2-way
   interaction emerged between depression and diabetes-related
   uncontrollable hunger related to bulimic symptoms (beta-1.82, p<.01).
   Conclusions In addition to psychosocial risk, disease-and
   treatment-based hunger and satiety dysregulation appear to be important
   factors contributing to report of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D.
   These preliminary findings have significant treatment implications for
   bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: There is great interest, supported by clinical
   experience, in the relationship between Eating Disorders (EDs) and
   psychiatric symptoms and diseases. The psychopathology of EDs is also
   referred to many risk and protective factors, and there is some evidence
   in the literature, also about genetic and neurobiological factors
   involved. The aim of this review is to examine and synthesize the recent
   scientific literature on this topic, in particular the complex
   relationship between Anorexia Nervosa and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
   Methods: We analyzed the best of published literature on the topic,
   identifying keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and then searching them.
   The last search was performed on November 2017.
   Results: Psychiatric comorbidities are very common in anorexia nervosa.
   Mood disorders, major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders,
   obsessive-compulsive disorders, developmental disorders among autistic
   spectrum and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and even some
   personality disorders, substance abuse and borderline traits have been
   reported, and some observations suggest a positive genetic correlation
   between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: The great amount of scientific articles dealing with the
   relationship between EDs and psychopathology confirms the complexity of
   these problems and the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. An
   accurate diagnosis and assessment of clinical risk about psychological,
   psychiatric, nutritional and somatic aspects are therefore essential for
   an appropriate therapeutic management of patients affected by anorexia
   nervosa.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Over the past thirty years, since the dawn of metagenomic studies, a
   completely new (micro) universe was revealed, with the potential to have
   profound impacts on many aspects of the society. Remarkably, the study
   of human microbiome provided a new perspective on a myriad of human
   traits previously regarded as solely (epi-) genetically encoded, such as
   disease susceptibility, immunological response, and social and
   nutritional behaviors. In this context, metagenomics has established a
   powerful framework for understanding the intricate connections between
   human societies and microbial communities, ultimately allowing for the
   optimization of both human health and productivity. Thus, we have
   shifted from the old concept of microbes as harmful organisms to a
   broader panorama, in which the signal of the relationship between humans
   and microbes is flexible and directly dependent on our own decisions and
   practices. In parallel, metagenomics has also been playing a major role
   in the prospection of ``hidden{''} genetic features and the development
   of biotechnological applications, through the discovery of novel genes,
   enzymes, pathways, and bioactive molecules with completely new or
   improved biochemical functions. Therefore, this review highlights the
   major milestones over the last three decades of metagenomics, providing
   insights into both its potentialities and current challenges.}},

Booktitle = {{MEMORY AND LEARNING IN PLANTS}},
Series = {{Signaling and Communication in Plants}},
Year = {{2018}},
Pages = {{191-213}},
Abstract = {{Mycorrhizal fungal networks linking the roots of trees in forests are
   increasingly recognized to facilitate inter-tree communication via
   resource, defense, and kin recognition signaling and thereby influence
   the sophisticated behavior of neighbors. These tree behaviors have
   cognitive qualities, including capabilities in perception, learning, and
   memory, and they influence plant traits indicative of fitness. Here, I
   present evidence that the topology of mycorrhizal networks is similar to
   neural networks, with scale-free patterns and small-world properties
   that are correlated with local and global efficiencies important in
   intelligence. Moreover, the multiple exploration strategies of
   interconnecting fungal species have parallels with crystallized and
   fluid intelligence that are important in memory-based learning. The
   biochemical signals that transmit between trees through the fungal
   linkages are thought to provide resource subsidies to receivers,
   particularly among regenerating seedlings, and some of these signals
   appear to have similarities with neurotransmitters. I provide examples
   of neighboring tree behavioral, learning, and memory responses
   facilitated by communication through mycorrhizal networks, including,
   respectively, (1) enhanced understory seedling survival, growth,
   nutrition, and mycorrhization, (2) increased defense chemistry and kin
   selection, and (3) collective memory-based interactions among trees,
   fungi, salmon, bears, and people that enhance the health of the whole
   forest ecosystem. Viewing this evidence through the lens of tree
   cognition, microbiome collaborations, and forest intelligence may
   contribute to a more holistic approach to studying ecosystems and a
   greater human empathy and caring for the health of our forests.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose In recent years, a new term-orthorexia nervosa (ON)-has been
   introduced in the field of clinical assessment and psychotherapy.
   Orthorexia nervosa is defined as a fixation on healthy food and a
   pathological obsession to eat food with more natural, higher quality
   ingredients. Although instruments to measure ON are available, no study
   on the psychometric properties of the original developed instrument by
   Bratman (Orthorexia nervosa: Overcoming the obsession with healthful
   eating, Broadway Books, New York, 2000) in a large clinical sample
   exists until now.
   Methods The study was conducted in a large clinic in Germany. The study
   sample consisted of N = 1122 inpatients, 70\% were female, and the mean
   age was 41 years (SD = 14 years). The main diagnoses at the end of
   treatment were affective disorders (46\%), followed by eating disorders
   (13\%), anxiety disorders (10\%), and personality disorders (10\%). The
   patients filled out several instruments, like the Ortho-10, the 10-item
   version of the orthorexia nervosa instrument, and other
   construct-related, disorder-specific and construct-distant instruments.
   Results The exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure:
   an eating disorder-specific factor and an orthorexia-nervosa specific
   factor. The eating disorder factor showed good convergent and
   discriminative validity in which patients with eating disorders and
   those without could correctly be classified. However, the
   orthorexia-nervosa specific factor revealed no informational gain
   compared to the eating disorder-specific factor in this clinical sample.
   Conclusions Further investigation is necessary to approach the concept
   of ON and its sense in clinical samples.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how variation in nestling begging intensity
   influences the behaviour of adult raptors and how responses of adult
   males and females to such variation might differ. Our objective was to
   manipulate the begging intensity of nestling American Kestrels (Falco
   sparverius) and examine the responses of adults. We studied 12 pairs of
   American Kestrels nesting in nest boxes from 1 March to 1 July 2014 at
   the Blue Grass Army Depot, Madison County, Kentucky. Nest boxes were
   modified with a separate compartment for a camcorder to record nestling
   behaviour, and a second camcorder was placed outside the nests to
   monitor adult behaviour. To manipulate nestling hunger levels, 12 to
   26-day-old nestlings in six nests were deprived of food for 24 h and
   those in the other six nests were fed until satiated. At each nest, we
   alternated control (no treatment) and treatment (fed or food deprived)
   days over a 4 day period to minimise the possible effect of nestling age
   on adult and nestling behaviour. Nestling begging intensity differed
   among treatments, with nestlings in food-deprived nests begging with
   greater intensity after food deprivation and those in fed-treatment
   nests begging with less intensity after being fed. Adult male and female
   American Kestrels provisioned nestlings at similar rates, with both
   sexes feeding nestlings at higher rates after food deprivation and at
   lower rates after fed treatments. Thus, the begging behaviour of
   nestling American Kestrels varied with hunger level, and adult American
   Kestrels responded by adjusting provisioning rates. Although the
   response of adults to nestling begging suggests that natural selection
   might favour `dishonest' begging to obtain more food, the potential
   costs of `dishonest' begging, such as attracting predators, reduced
   immunocompetence, and loss of indirect fitness benefits if such begging
   negatively impacts siblings and parents, may outweigh any possible
   benefit.}},

Title = {{Laboratory-reared and field-collected predators respond differently to
   same experimental treatments}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory studies of animal behavior can use animals with different
   developmental histories, including those that have spent most of their
   lives in the field or those raised in the laboratory. Both types of
   animals are assumed to respond similarly to experimental treatments. The
   goal of this study was to test if this assumption is true, if
   field-collected and lab-reared animals respond similarly to experimental
   treatments. In the first experiments, we test how diet (high lipid or
   protein) affected mating behaviors of male jumping spiders, Phidippus
   audax. Male spiders had opposite responses to diet based on their
   rearing condition in both scramble competition and male-male interaction
   trials. Field-collected spiders fed with high-protein diets and
   lab-reared spiders fed with high-lipid diets found mates quicker and
   were more aggressive than their counter parts fed with different diets.
   Field-collected spiders were also more active in open arenas and courted
   females more actively than lab-reared spiders. In a second experiment,
   we tested spiders for preference of flower color, and found that both
   lab-reared and field-collected spiders selected flowers with color over
   white flowers. However, field-collected spiders prefer red flowers with
   UV fluorescence, while lab-reared spiders seem to prefer red without UV.
   These results suggest that lab-reared and field-collected animals can
   respond differently to the same experimental treatments. Further work is
   needed to test if this happens in other animals, and which types of
   individuals (lab-reared or field collect) best reflect the responses of
   animals in nature.
   Significance statement
   Laboratory studies are commonly used to study animal behavior. Animals
   used in these studies can be either raised in the laboratory or
   collected from the field just prior to the study. While lab-reared and
   field-collected animals can differ sometimes in their behavior (e.g.,
   more or less active in response to a treatment), they are both assumed
   to respond in qualitatively the same manner. However, this does not
   appear to be the case in our study of a common species of jumping
   spider, Phidippus audax. Labreared and field-collected animals responded
   in opposite directions to identical treatment conditions. These results
   suggest that the developmental histories of animals can fundamentally
   affect how they respond to experimental treatments in the laboratory
   and, hence, the conclusions drawn from such studies.}},

Title = {{Predators mediate above- vs. belowground herbivory in a salt marsh crab}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Predators can significantly affect prey by removing prey individuals and
   by changing prey behavior. The tradeoff between foraging behavior and
   predation risk may result in a trophic cascade that can have important
   effects on ecosystem processes. For herbivores that can feed both above-
   and below-ground, it is likely that predation risk affects the location
   of feeding. We tested whether two species of predatory marsh crabs
   affected feeding behavior of the herbivorous crab, Sesarma reticulatum.
   We found that predatory crabs could kill or injure Sesarma and that
   Sesarma did less damage to its food plant Spartina alterniflora in the
   presence of the more dangerous predator. Sesarma prefers to feed on and
   grows better on belowground rhizomes than aboveground leaves; however,
   the costs of digging burrows to access rhizomes lead to higher mortality
   if it is the only diet option. The location of feeding did not affect
   total biomass of S. alterniflora. For Sesarma, a choice in feeding
   location allows the crabs the behavioral flexibility to balance the
   risks of predation, the nutritional benefit of feeding belowground, and
   the survival costs of belowground feeding. Similar tradeoffs are likely
   to increase the success of other herbivores that can feed both above-and
   belowground.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Personality research suggests that individual differences in risk
   aversion may be explained by links with life-history variation. However,
   few empirical studies examine whether repeatable differences in risk
   avoidance behaviour covary with life-history traits among individuals in
   natural populations, or how these links vary depending on the context
   and the way risk aversion is measured. We measured two different risk
   avoidance behaviours (latency to enter the nest and inspection time) in
   wild great tits (Parus major) in two different contexts-response to a
   novel object and to a predator cue placed at the nest-box during
   incubation-and related these behaviours to female reproductive success
   and condition. Females responded equally strongly to both stimuli, and
   although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate.
   Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number
   of offspring fledged. By contrast, inspection time was directly
   explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest
   before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between
   risk aversion and fitness depend on how risk aversion was measured. Our

Abstract = {{We used Argos-linked Fastloc-Global Positioning System (Argos-linked
   Fastloc-GPS) satellite tags to investigate how loggerhead sea turtles
   use neritic foraging habitats at multiple scales. Out of 24 turtles, six
   individuals used more than one foraging site, with all sites being
   separated by >25 km. These six individuals used up to four sites,
   remaining at each site for a mean of 150 days and returning to the same
   site a minimum of 52 days later. The other 18 turtles remained in a
   single site. The area within sites was not used uniformly, with 15 out
   of 24 turtles exhibiting complex movement patterns within and amongst up
   to five focal patches, which were typically 0.1-5.0 km apart within a
   single site. Movements between sites and patches might sometimes have
   reflected overwintering behaviour; however, similar movement patterns
   occurred at multiple times of the year, suggesting other factors were
   also involved. Use of multiple sites and patches might be driven by
   differences in resource availability, such as food and/or night-time
   refuges, competition, or exploratory movement to investigate or locate
   alternative patches. We confirmed competition via direct visual
   observations of aggressive interactions between individuals at one

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early life stress (ELS) in macaques in the form of insecure
   maternal attachment putatively induces epigenetic adaptations resulting
   in a ``thrifty phenotype{''} throughout the life cycle. For instance,
   ELS induces persistent increases in insulin resistance, hippocampal and
   corpus callosum atrophy and reduced ``behavioral plasticity{''}, which,
   taken together, engenders an increased risk for mood and anxiety
   disorders in humans but also a putative sparing of calories. Herein, we
   test the hypothesis whether a thrifty phenotype induced by ELS is
   peripherally evident as hypotrophy of cardiac structure and function,
   raising the possibility that certain mood disorders may represent
   maladaptive physiological and central thrift adaptations.
   Methods: 14 adult bonnet macaques (6 males) exposed to the maternal
   variable foraging demand (VFD) model of ELS were compared to 20 non-VFD
   adult subjects (6 males). Left ventricle end-diastolic dimension
   (LVEDD), Left ventricle end-systolic dimension (LVESD) and stroke volume
   (SV) were calculated using echocardiography. Blood pressure and heart
   rate were measured only in females. Previously obtained neurobehavioral
   correlates available only in males were analyzed in the context of
   cardiac parameters.
   Results: Reduced LVESD (p < 0.05) was observed when controlled for age,
   sex, body weight and crown-rump length whereas ejection fraction (EF) (p
   = 0.037) was greater in VFD-reared versus non-VFD subjects. Pulse
   pressure was lower in VFD versus non-VFD females (p < 0.05). Male
   timidity in response to a human intruder was associated with reduced
   LVEDD (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: ELS is associated with both structural and functional
   reductions of left ventricular measures, potentially implying a
   body-wide thrifty phenotype. Parallel ``thrift{''} adaptations may occur
   in key brain areas following ELS and may play an unexplored role in mood
   and anxiety disorder susceptibility. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hypremesis Gravidarum (HG) is a common disease in pregnancy
   during the first trimester. Patients suffering from HG commonly present
   with dehydration, nutritional depletion, electrolyte imbalance, and the
   loss of at least 5\% of body weight. Although the psychological etiology
   of HG is not clear, it has been shown that psychiatric symptoms are
   extensively present in patients with HG. Objectives: The aim of this
   study was to investigate the relationship between temperament,
   attachment style and hyperemesis gravidarum.
   Materials and Methods: This case-control study was conducted at
   Kirikkale University Hospital in Kirikkale, Turkey, between May 2015 and
   May 2017. A total of 98 pregnant women suffering from HG in their first
   trimester of pregnancy (HG group) and 95 healthy pregnant women in their
   first trimester of pregnancy (control group) were included in the study.
   Adult attachment styles were determined as secure, fearful, preoccupied,
   and dismissing. The evaluation of temperament was done using the TEMPS-A
   scale.
   Results: The mean secure attachment style score in the HG group was 3.9
   +/- 0.9 and significantly lower than the mean attachment style score
   (4.6 +/- 1.1) in the control group (P = 0.001). In the TEMPS-A scale,
   patients with HG showed significantly higher mean depressive (9.7 +/-
   3.8) and mean anxious scores (13 +/- 2.3) than those of the control
   group (6.6 +/- 2.9 and 8 +/- 0.9, respectively) (P = 0.001 and P =
   0.040, respectively).
   Conclusions: This study revealed that HG patients had more common
   depressive and anxious temperament characteristics and lower secure
   attachment style than non-HG patients. Due to the fact that attachment
   and temperament styles are relatively stable throughout life, we thought
   that psychiatric problems may play a role on development of HG.}},

Abstract = {{Predation impacts development, behavior and morphology of prey species
   thereby shaping their abundances, distribution and community structure.
   Non-lethal threat of predation, specifically, can have a strong
   influence on prey lifehistory characteristics. While investigations
   often focus on the impact of predation threat on prey in isolation,
   tests of its interactive effects with food availability and resource
   competition on prey survival and fitness can improve understanding of
   costs, benefits and trade-offs of anti-predator strategies. This study,
   involving Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a model organism, investigates
   both simple and interactive effects of predation threat during the
   larval stage on survival, size at and time to maturity, stored teneral
   reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid in adults, and adult longevity.
   Our results show that development times of mosquito larvae were
   increased (by 14.84\% in males and by 97.63\% in females), and size of
   eclosing adults decreased (by 62.30\% in males and by 58.33\% in
   females) when exposed to lowered nutrition and elevated intraspecific
   competition, but that predation had no detectable effect on these simple
   traits. Teneral reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid and adult
   longevity were positively correlated with adult body size. Non-lethal
   predation threat had significant interactive effects with nutrition and
   larval competition on teneral reserves in males and adult longevity in
   males and females. The sexes responded differently to conditions
   encountered as larvae, with the larval environment affecting development
   and adult characteristics more acutely for females than for males. The
   outcome of this study shows how threat of predation on juveniles can
   have long-lasting effects on adults that are likely to impact mosquito
   population dynamics and that may impact disease transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals

   estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour
   attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that
   only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level

   levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of
   among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was
   nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive
   explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual
   variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear,
   additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii)
   explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv)

Abstract = {{Predation risk affects foraging behavior and, particularly, the amount
   of time devoted to the search for food. When exposed to predation risk,
   food deprived animals should be risk prone and relax behavioral defenses
   to a wider extent than well fed individuals. To test for this
   prediction, we used a 2 x 2 factorial design experiment, manipulating
   both the energetic state (fed vs. fasted) and exposure to an
   attack-released cue (injured vs. uninjured conspecifics) of common water
   frog tadpoles (Pelophylax kl. esculentus). Contrary to expectations,
   food deprivation significantly lowered the activity level of
   predator-exposed tadpoles. As in this experiment no food resource was
   added to test containers, energy conserving behavior might have both
   delayed starvation and lowered the probability of encountering the
   potential predator. To test for the effect of food availability on
   behavioral responses, we performed a second experiment, using the same
   protocol and procedures, except for adding food to all test containers.
   All tadpoles showed similar levels of activity, while fed tadpoles
   exposed to alarm cues tended to swim farther from the cage containing
   the stimulus than in the first experiment. As many anuran larvae can
   feed on dead conspecifics, prey-borne cues may have been interpreted as
   the potential presence of both a food source and a predator, fed
   tadpoles possibly being more confident than fasted tadpoles in their
   ability to escape predation in case an actual attack occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: The aim of this study was to examine, in a

   Methods and results: Participants were 532 community-living middle-aged
   and elderly adults from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through
   Life study. They spanned the full weight range
   (underweight/normal/overweight/obese). Latent class analysis and
   multivariate generalised linear models were used to investigate the
   association of Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m(2)) trajectory over twelve
   years with plasma insulin (mu lU/ml), plasma glucose (mmol/L), and HOMA2
   insulin resistance and beta cell function at follow-up. All models were
   adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, pre-clinical diabetes status
   (normal fasting glucose or impaired fasting glucose) and physical
   activity. Four weight trajectories were extracted; constant normal (mean
   baseline BMI = 25; follow-up BMI = 25), constant high (mean baseline BMI
   = 36; follow-up BMI = 37), increase (mean baseline BMI = 26; follow-up
   BMI = 32) and decrease (mean baseline BMI = 34; follow-up BMI = 28). At
   any given current BMI, individuals in the constant high and increase
   trajectories had significantly higher plasma insulin, greater insulin
   resistance, and higher beta cell function than those in the constant

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Predators can alter nutrient cycles simply by inducing stress in prey.
   This stress accelerates prey's protein catabolism, nitrogen waste
   production, and nitrogen cycling. Yet predators also reduce the feeding
   rates of their prey, inducing food deprivation that is expected to slow
   protein catabolism and nitrogen cycling. The physiology of prey under
   predation risk thus balances the influences of predation risk and food
   deprivation, and this balance is central to understanding the role of
   predators in nutrient cycles. We explored the separate and combined
   effects of predation risk and food deprivation on prey physiology and
   nutrient cycling by exposing guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to predation
   risk and food deprivation in a 2x2 design. We simulated predation risk
   using chemical cues from a natural predator of guppies, and we created
   food deprivation by rationing food availability. We measured guppy
   response as food consumption, growth, tissue energy density, tissue
   carbon:nitrogen, and nitrogen (N) excretion and assimilation. We found
   that N-linked physiological processes (N consumption, assimilation,
   excretion) were strongly affected by predation risk, independent of food
   consumption. Guppies excreted substantially less under predation risk
   than they did under food deprivation or control conditions. These
   results suggest that predation risk, per se, triggers physiological
   changes in guppies that increase N retention and decrease N excretion.
   We suggest that slower N metabolism under predation risk is an adaptive
   response that minimizes protein loss in the face of predictable,
   predator-induced food restriction. Notably, N metabolism shares common
   hormonal control with food seeking behavior, and we speculate that
   increased N retention is a direct and immediate result of reduced food
   seeking under predation risk. Contrary to predation-stress-based
   hypotheses for how predators affect nutrient cycling by prey, our result
   indicates that even short-term exposure topredators may decelerate,
   rather than accelerate, the speed of N cycling by suppressing N turnover
   by prey.}},

Abstract = {{The planktonic rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, displays extensive
   variation in the length of its anterior and posterior spines. Notably,
   posterolateral spines may be absent or near body length. Studies of
   laboratory and natural populations have identified the different factors
   controlling this variation and have investigated the trade-offs
   associated with increased spine development. Low temperature and low
   food availability can induce modest spine elongation that may reduce
   sinking rate. A kairomone released by the carnivorous rotifer Asplanchna
   induces pronounced spine elongation, without detectable reproductive
   cost, that can provide an effective defense against this predator.
   Endogenous mechanisms also operate: Spine development is inhibited in
   females hatched from fertilized resting eggs and can be promoted by
   increasing maternal age. Genetic variation for the length of spines in
   both noninduced (default) and induced phenotypes occurs among and within
   populations. Asplanchna in natural communities likely leads to seasonal
   selection for genotypes that can develop increasingly long spines.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the antioxidant properties of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) and
   the involvement of oxidative stress events in paraquat-induced
   neurotoxicity, this study investigated the protective effect of dietary
   Na2SeO3 on biochemical and behavioral parameters of zebrafish exposed to
   paraquat (PQ). Fish were pretreated with a Na2SeO3 diet for 21 days and
   then PQ (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with six
   injections for 16 days. In the novel tank test, the Na2SeO3 diet
   prevented the locomotor impairments, as well as the increase in the time
   spent in the top area of the tank, and the exacerbation of freezing
   episodes. In the preference for conspecifics and in the mirror-induced
   aggression (MIA) tasks, Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in the latency to
   enter the area closer to conspecifics and the agonistic behavior of
   PQ-treated animals, respectively. Na2SeO3 prevented the increase of
   carbonylated protein (CP), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
   nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels, as well as the decrease in non-protein
   thiols (NPSH) levels. Regarding the antioxidant enzymatic defenses,
   Na2SeO3 prevented the increase in catalase (CAT) and glutathione
   peroxidase (GPx) activities caused by PQ. Altogether, dietary Na2SeO3
   improves behavioral and biochemical function impaired by PQ treatment in
   zebrafish, by modulating not only redox parameters, but also anxiety-
   and aggressive-like phenotypes in zebrafish.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Learned aspects of song affect female mating preferences in a number of
   species of songbirds, including swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana. One
   explanation for why female songbirds attend to such song features is
   that these song attributes convey information on the general cognitive
   ability of singers. The fact that song attributes and cognitive ability
   are affected during development by the same stressors makes a connection
   between the two plausible. Here we test the hypothesis that song is a
   signal of cognitive ability by relating five measures of song quality to
   five measures of cognitive performance in 49 captive male swamp
   sparrows. The five song measures are repertoire size, mean and minimum
   vocal deviation (measures of vocal performance), and mean and maximum
   typicality (measures of song learning). Cognitive performance was
   measured as the speed with which five cognitive tasks were mastered: a
   novel foraging task, a colour association, a colour reversal, a spatial
   learning problem and a detour-reaching test. In general linear mixed
   models controlling for neophobia, none of the song measures were
   predictive of any of the cognitive performance measures. Thus the
   results do not support the hypothesis that song attributes signal
   general cognition in swamp sparrows. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Pages = {{407-420}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to
   exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of
   the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent
   the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait
   evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the
   shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are
   either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines
   prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is
   sufficiently antagonistic (e.g., nutritional prey are harder to
   capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable
   states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly
   antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype
   pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing
   genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for coexistence if,
   along its equilibria, the geometric mean of recovery rates exceeds the
   geometric mean of loss rates of the rare genotypes or species. By
   affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can mediate coexistence,
   while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid populations
   experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic
   contributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an
   eco-evolutionary storage effect. Density dependence and mutations also
   promote coexistence. These results highlight how the efficacy of
   evolution as a coexistence mechanismmay depend on the underlying genetic
   architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The risk that an animal's offspring are eaten by predators is thought to
   strongly influence an animal's decisions regarding reproductive effort.
   We found that birds breeding in locations with a high risk of nest
   predation laid fewer eggs than their conspecifics nesting in areas with
   a lower risk of nest predation. Montane birds nesting at higher
   elevations lay fewer eggs than at lower elevations because of the higher
   risk of nest predation at higher elevations.Questions about the
   ecological drivers of, and mechanistic constraints on, productivity have
   driven research on life-history evolution for decades. Resource
   availability and offspring mortality are considered among the 2 most
   important influences on the number of offspring per reproductive
   attempt. We used a factorial experimental design to manipulate food
   abundance and perceived offspring predation risk in a wild avian
   population (red-faced warblers; Cardellina rubrifrons) to identify the
   mechanistic cause of variation in avian clutch size. Additionally, we
   tested whether female quality helped explain the extant variation in
   clutch size. We found no support for the Food Limitation or Female
   Quality Hypotheses, but we did find support for both predictions of the
   Nest Predation Risk Hypothesis. Females that experienced an
   experimentally heightened perception of offspring predation risk
   responded by laying a smaller clutch than females in the control group.
   Additionally, predation rates at artificial nests were highest where
   red-faced warbler clutch size was smallest (at high elevations).
   Life-history theory predicts that an individual should invest less in
   reproduction when high nest predation risk reduces the likely benefit
   from that nesting attempt and, indeed, we found that birds exhibit
   phenotypic plasticity in clutch size by laying fewer eggs in response to
   increasing nest predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the direct links between animals and their
   environment can offer insights into the drivers and constraints to
   animal movement. Constraints on movement interact in complex ways with
   the physiology of the animal (metabolism) and physical environment (food
   and weather), but can be modelled using physical principles of energy
   and mass exchange. Here, we describe a general, spatially explicit
   individual-based movement model that couples a nutritional energy and
   mass budget model (dynamic energy budget theory) with a biophysical
   model of heat exchange. This provides a highly integrated method for
   constraining an ectothermic animal's movement in response to how food
   and microclimates vary in space and time. The model uses r to drive a
   NetLogo individual-based model together with microclimate and energy-
   and mass-budget modelling functions from the r package NicheMapR. It
   explicitly incorporates physiological and morphological traits,
   behavioural thermoregulation, movement strategies and movement costs.
   From this, the model generates activity budgets of foraging and
   shade-seeking, home range behaviour, spatial movement patterns and life
   history consequences under user-defined configurations of food and
   microclimates. To illustrate the model, we run simulations of the
   Australian sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa under different movement
   strategies (optimising or satisficing) in two contrasting habitats of
   varying food and shade (sparse and dense). We then compare the results
   with real, fine-scale movement data of a wild population throughout the
   breeding season. Our results show that (1) the extremes of movement
   behaviour observed in sleepy lizards are consistent with feeding
   requirements (passive movement) and thermal constraints (active
   movement), (2) the model realistically captures majority of the
   distribution of observed home range size, (3) both satisficing and
   optimising movement strategies appear to exist in the wild population,
   but home range size more closely approximates an optimising strategy,
   and (4) satisficing was more energetically efficient than optimising
   movement, which returned no additional benefit in metabolic fitness
   outputs. This framework for predicting physical constraints to
   individual movement can be extended to individual-level interactions
   with the same or different species and provides new capabilities for
   forecasting future responses to novel resource and weather scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Many people visit intertidal mudflats to collect bait and seafood, or

   mudflats frequently. Trampling would not be life threatening to most
   animals in the intertidal flats as they have evolved hiding behavior to
   escape predation. However, what is the effect of trampling on the
   behavior of intertidal animals? In this study, the effect of mudflat
   trampling on the activity of crabs (e.g. fiddler crabs, sentinel crabs)
   living on the mudflat was explored. The number of crabs active on the
   mudflat surface in experimental plots (1.5 x 1.5 m(2)) before and after
   (10 min. and 30 min.) trampling of three different intensities (Heavy
   trampling = 60 steps; Moderate trampling = 20 steps; and No trampling)

   number of crabs active on the surface decreased and was significantly
   lower than that of control plots. The more intensively trampled the
   mudflat was, the fewer crabs were active on the mudflat surface.
   Surprisingly, the number of active crabs did not recover even 30 min.

Abstract = {{Background: Folates in their role as key one carbon donors, are
   essential for two major pathways: the synthesis of DNA and RNA
   precursors and DNA methylation. A growing body of evidence from
   epidemiological studies indicates a possible association between
   nutritional and functional deficiency in folates and Autism Spectrum
   Disorders (ASD). However, there are no available behavioral animal
   studies on periconceptional one-carbon donor deficiency during gestation
   and the autistic phenotype.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if the
   periconceptional alteration of one-carbon metabolism induced with a
   folate deficient diet would affect the behaviour of rat offspring.
   Methods: Female Wistar rats were divided in two groups: control (basal
   diet, in compliance with standards of regular laboratory diets), or
   exposed during one month before breeding until Gestational Day 15 to a
   modified diet with no added folic acid (0.2 mg/kg of food), reduced
   choline (750 mg/kg of food), and added 1\% SST (a non-absorbable
   antibiotic used to inhibit folate synthesis by gut bacteria). We
   administered behavioral tests to offspring, i.e., open field (P20),
   social interactions (P25), marble burying (P30), elevated plus maze
   (P35), and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex
   (sensorimotor gating) (P45). Blood homocysteine levels were used to
   confirm the deficit in one-carbon donors.
   Results: Compared to controls, offspring with the periconceptional
   deficit in folate showed: (i) congenital body malformations; (ii)
   reduced social interactions, with a similar to 30\% decrease in social
   sniffing behavior; (iii) reduced exploration of the open arm by 50\% in
   the elevated plus maze test, indicating increased anxiety; (iv) a 160\%
   increased number of marbles buried, indicating repetitive behaviors; and
   (v) altered sensorimotor gating, with a global 50\% decrease in startle
   inhibition.
   Conclusion: Maternal periconceptional deficit in folate provokes
   alterations in the behavior of offspring relevant to the autistic-like
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis of pace-of-life syndromes (POLS) predicts relationships
   between traits including life history traits and risk-taking behaviour
   that can be mediated by the trade-off between current and future
   reproductive value. However, alternative causal mechanisms may also
   generate covariance among these traits without trade-offs. We
   investigated the relationships between survival to the next year,
   current reproductive investment and risk-taking behaviour (flight
   initiation distance) in male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis,
   using long-term data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to
   uncover whether the associations among traits are mediated by a common
   latent factor that determines how individuals balance the trade-off
   between current and future reproductive value. As trade-offs could be
   concealed when there are differences in resource acquisition between
   individuals, we also included potential causes of these differences,
   body mass and body size, in the analysis. We found that risk-taking
   behaviour was positively related to reproductive investment and
   negatively to survival to the next year as could be predicted if
   investment into a risky behaviour is traded against future prospects.
   However, the most supported SEM model also suggested that survival to
   the next year was positively related to current reproductive investment,
   contrary to predictions of a hypothesis based on trade-off. These
   results remained qualitatively similar when controlling for body
   condition. In conclusion, we only could derive partial support for the
   POLS hypothesis. We suggest that aspects of individual quality, and not
   only trade-offs, should also be considered when interpreting the
   relationships between life history and behavioural traits.
   Significance statement
   We investigated the association between two life history components
   (survival to the next year and current reproductive effort) and
   risk-taking behaviour, relying on long-term records from a passerine
   bird, to investigate the predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS)
   hypothesis. Using structural equation modelling, we found support for a
   causal model that implies that risk-taking negatively affects survival
   to the next year and that survival to the next year and current
   reproductive effort are strongly and positively associated. Controlling
   for the effect of body condition did not fundamentally change these
   relationships. We could not find conclusive evidence for the
   investigated traits being mediated by a common underlying factor, as
   generally predicted by the POLS hypothesis. However, the sign of the
   relationship between risk-taking behaviour and survival to the next year
   was as predicted by the POLS hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ways in which individuals cope with threats, respond

   of their surroundings is important for predicting their ability to

   drivers of coping behaviour of adults is the environment experienced
   during their early-life development. Although the study of coping,
   defined as behaviours displayed in response to environmental challenges,
   has a long and rich research history in biology, recent literature has
   repeatedly pointed out that the processes through which coping
   behaviours develop in individuals are still largely unknown. In this
   review, we make a move towards integrating ultimate and proximate lines
   of coping behaviour research. After broadly defining coping behaviours
   (1), we review why, from an evolutionary perspective, the development of
   coping has become tightly linked to the early-life environment (2),
   which relevant developmental processes are most important in creating
   coping behaviours adjusted to the early-life environment (3), which
   influences have been shown to impact those developmental processes (4)
   and what the adaptive significance of intergenerational transmission of
   coping behaviours is, in the context of behavioural adaptations to a
   fast changing world (5). Important concepts such as effects of parents,

Abstract = {{Correlations between behavioral, physiological, and morphological traits
   linked to life history' have been given the label ``pace-of-life
   syndrome{''} (POLS), hypothesized to arise through variation in the
   resolution of a trade-off between present and future reproduction.
   However, other trade-offs over energy allocation may also have effects
   and influence the present-future trade-off. We analyzed an optimality
   model of basal metabolic rate (BMR) across variation in food
   availability and two types of mortality. The model contained three major
   features: (1) feedback between activity and energy acquisition, (2)
   links between BMR and the use of energy for other traits, and (3)
   allocation trade-offs between BMR and all other traits, between activity
   and defense, and between defense against activity-related risk and
   activity-independent risk. The model produced an intermediate optimal
   BMR that was usually highest at an intermediate level of food
   availability. Food availability and both types of mortality risk
   interacted to influence the exact value of optimal BMR. Trait
   correlations expected in the POLS existed under some environmental
   conditions, but these correlations flipped sign under different
   conditions and were not always strong. Our model reproduces trait
   correlations consistent with the POLS, but also generated a ``sloppy{''}
   syndrome with considerable non-POLS-like variation. In addition,
   among-individual, non-adaptive variation in BMR produced adjustments of
   the other traits. These fit a best-of-a-had job strategy, and the
   adjustments further weakened trait correlations. The results emphasize
   that variation in resources and mortality risk creates a diversity of
   correlation structures. This complexity means the POLS is likely to be a
   variable construct.
   Significance statement
   Many attributes important for reproduction and survival are associated.
   Such associations may arise through common physiological processes and
   con-elated selection. We modeled metabolic rate within a system in which
   foraging behavior both depended on and mediated the acquisition of
   resources necessary for metabolism, while energy was allocated among
   multiple attributes. Variation in several environmental variables (food
   availability and two types of mortality risk) influenced basal metabolic
   rate, activity, and defenses against mortality risk. This variation
   affected the correlations between the traits in complex ways. When basal
   metabolic rate was non-optimal, evolution of the allocation of energy to
   other traits partially compensated, but this further eroded consistent
   trait correlations. Our results indicate that complexity in how energy
   is acquired and used can potentially disrupt trait correlations normally
   associated with the pace-of-life syndrome.}},

   Here we inspect chemical traits of the physogastric staphylinid Corotoca
   melantho (Insecta: Coleoptera) and its termite host Constrictotermes
   cyphergaster (Insecta: Blattodea: Isoptera), aiming to verify whether
   staphylinids resemble their host. First, we compared CHC profiles of
   hosts and guests within and among termitaria, to gather evidence on the
   origin of such profiles in guests. Then, we examined nitrogen and carbon
   isotopic signatures of these cohabitants to inspect whether chemical
   disguise is achieved by predation of host workers by staphylinids.
   Beetles presented CHC more similar to the CHC of their cohabiting
   termites than to (i)their conspecifics and (ii)termites from another
   nest, thereby favouring the hypothesis on CHC acquisition by guests.
   Isotopic signatures revealed that such similarities could not be majorly
   determined by share nutrition between these cohabitants. In general, our
   results evidenced that chemical disguise in termitophiles may function
   as a strategy for social integration in morphological mimics.}},

   shared host plant}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Phytophagy is a common feature among pure herbivorous insects and
   omnivores that utilise both plant and prey as food resources;
   nevertheless, experimental evidence for factors affecting their
   interactions is restricted to intraguild predation and predator-mediated
   competition. We herein focused on plantmediated effects that could
   result from plant defence activation or quality alteration and compared
   the performance of an omnivore, the western flower thrips Frankliniella
   occidentalis, and a pure herbivore, the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes
   vaporariorum, on cucumber plants previously infested with either
   species. Furthermore, we recorded their behavioural responses when given
   a choice among infested and clean plants. Whiteflies laid less eggs on
   plants previously exposed to thrips but more on whiteflyinfested plants.
   Thrips survival was negatively affected on whitefly-infested than on
   thrips-infested or clean plants. Notably, whiteflies developed
   significantly faster on plants infested with conspecifics. In
   accordance, whiteflies avoided thrips-infested plants and preferred
   whitefly-infested over clean plants. Thrips showed no preference for
   either infested or clean plants. Our study is a first report on the role
   of plant-mediated effects in shaping omnivore-herbivore interactions.
   Considering the factors driving such interactions we will likely better
   understand the ecology of the more complex relationships among plants
   and pest organisms.}},

Title = {{Do detour tasks provide accurate assays of inhibitory control?}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1875}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Transparent Cylinder and Barrier tasks are used to purportedly assess
   inhibitory control in a variety of animals. However, we suspect that
   performances on these detour tasks are influenced by non-cognitive
   traits, which may result in inaccurate assays of inhibitory control. We
   therefore reared pheasants under standardized conditions and presented
   each bird with two sets of similar tasks commonly used to measure
   inhibitory control. We recorded the number of times subjects incorrectly
   attempted to access a reward through transparent barriers, and their
   latencies to solve each task. Such measures are commonly used to infer
   the differential expression of inhibitory control. We found little
   evidence that their performances were consistent across the two
   different Putative Inhibitory Control Tasks (PICTs). Improvements in
   performance across trials showed that pheasants learned the affordances
   of each specific task. Critically, prior experience of transparent
   tasks, either Barrier or Cylinder, also improved subsequent inhibitory
   control performance on a novel task, suggesting that they also learned
   the general properties of transparent obstacles. Individual measures of
   persistence, assayed in a third task, were positively related to their
   frequency of incorrect attempts to solve the transparent inhibitory
   control tasks. Neophobia, Sex and Body Condition had no influence on
   individual performance. Contrary to previous studies of primates,
   pheasants with poor performance on PICTs had a wider dietary breadth
   assayed using a free-choice task. Our results demonstrate that in
   systems or taxa where prior experience and differences in development
   cannot be accounted for, individual differences in performance on
   commonly used detour-dependent PICTS may reveal more about an
   individual's prior experience of transparent objects, or their
   motivation to acquire food, than providing a reliable measure of their
   inhibitory control.}},

Title = {{Factors determining neophobia and neophilia with regard to new
   technologies applied to the food sector: A systematic review}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GASTRONOMY AND FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This systematic review was performed starting from the understanding of
   the complexity that characterizes the human relationship to food,
   combining different dimensions, ranging from those aspects going from
   the biological (nutritional function) to the cultural (symbolic
   function), as well as the ones linking the individual to the community,
   the psychological to the social. Addressing this multi-dimensional
   character is at the base of sound research paths aiming at assessing the
   determinants of consumers' choices and behaviors. This systematic review
   analyses and synthetizes the main results of recent studies dealing with
   food neophobia and neophilia with regard to new technologies applied to
   the food sector, both in the context of developed countries and in
   developing ones. In particular, main factors leading to caution and
   aversion for food technologies were identified and discussed, as well as
   different approaches to measure consumers' resistance to the mentioned
   technologies and to predict consumers' behavior.
   Scopus and Web of Science engines were used to search the existing
   literature and to identify the relevant studies to include, conducted in
   different countries and by means of different methodological approaches.
   These studies investigated the mentioned consumers' choices and
   behaviors, that are influenced by many interacting factors; the adoption
   of a relevant conceptual framework allows the distinction between distal
   (or primary) determinants, and proximal (or secondary) ones.
   Communication and attitudes or psychometric models constitute the base
   of the cited framework, and the link between the two determinants
   categories. In particular, an effective tool capable of enhancing the
   understanding of the neophobia-neophilia forces that determine food
   choices is the Food Technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS), with its
   fourcomponents constituting the base of a sound analysis of the
   influence on the mentioned choices of each single neophobia-neophilia
   force (risk perception and novelty seeking, media influence, own health
   and environmental concerns) as well as a device to turn the four
   components into a single, comprehensive framework. Finally, the case of
   consumer acceptance of the eating of insects is discussed as an emerging
   trend in food science.}},

Abstract = {{While the effects of nectar robbing on plants are relatively
   well-studied, its impacts from the perspective of the pollinators of
   robbed plants is not. Numerous studies do consider the impacts of
   robbing on pollinator visitation to robbed plants, but rarely do they
   focus on its scaled-up impacts on individual pollinator behavior. We
   used radio telemetry to track the spatial and behavioral responses of
   the territorial hummingbird Aglaeactis cupripennis to experimental
   nectar robbing over a period of several days. Simulated nectar robbing
   impacted foraging behavior by increasing territory area, distance flown,
   and reliance on novel food resources, especially small-bodied flying
   insects. We did not observe any impact on the amount of time individuals
   spent foraging, nor did we observe territory abandonment. These findings
   indicate that nectar robbing may impose a significant energetic cost on
   pollinators via increased flight distances and shifts towards
   potentially less profitable food resources, and demonstrate the
   importance of quantifying the indirect effects of nectar robbing on
   pollinators in addition to plants.}},

Journal = {{APPETITE}},

Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{82-90}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The links between parental restriction of food intake, child's eating
   behaviour and child's adiposity are still unclear. Our aim was to
   validate a model suggesting an underlying mechanism for the impact of
   parental restriction on child's adiposity through a broad dimension of
   child's eating temperament entitled the appetite reactivity (including
   both appetite arousal and appetite persistence). Using an online
   questionnaire administered at home to children aged between 8 and 11
   years (N = 414) with one or both of their parents, we measured: based on
   child's reports, the perceived maternal restriction of child's food
   intake, the appetite reactivity and both the desired and the eaten mean
   food portion sizes; based on parental reports, the mean food portion
   size given to the child and the child's BMI. Structural equation
   modelling was used to test a model linking measured variables. A
   well-fitting structural model (AGFI = 0.91; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.08)
   was identified, showing that: (i) perceived maternal restriction of
   child's food intake negatively impacts child's appetite arousal and food
   portion size but positively influences child's appetite persistence;
   (ii) the two components of appetite reactivity have a positive effect on
   child's adiposity which is partly mediated by child's actual food
   portion size. Results suggest an explanation for the controversy
   surrounding the links between parental food restriction and child's
   adiposity: through its negative impact on child's appetite arousal and
   food portion size, parental control may protect against overweight, but
   because of its positive effect on appetite persistence, it can also be
   detrimental. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies indicate that the outcome of nutritional and lifestyle
   interventions can be linked to brain `signatures' in terms of neural
   reactivity to food cues. However, `dieting' is often considered in a
   rather broad sense, and no study so far investigated modulations in
   brain responses to food cues occurring over an intervention specifically
   aiming to reduce sugar intake. We studied neural activity and liking in
   response to visual food cues in 14 intensive consumers of
   sugar-sweetened beverages before and after a 3-month replacement period
   by artificially-sweetened equivalents. Each time, participants were
   presented with images of solid foods differing in fat content and taste
   quality while high-density electro-encephalography was recorded.
   Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant weight loss over
   the intervention period and no changes were observed in food liking or
   in neural activity in regions sub serving salience and reward
   attribution. However, neural activity in response to high-fat, sweet
   foods was significantly reduced from pre-to post-intervention in
   prefrontal regions often linked to impulse control. This decrease in
   activity was associated with weight loss failure, suggesting an
   impairment in individuals' ability to exert control and adjust their
   solid food intake over the intervention period. Our findings highlight
   the need to implement multidisciplinary approaches when aiming to help
   individuals lose body weight. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The advent of assisted reproduction has allowed the conception of
   millions of individuals who otherwise would not have existed. Although
   most ART children are born healthy, there is increasing awareness of the
   plasticity of the human embryo causing concerns about potential
   long-term consequences of ART for the growth, development and health of
   this growing population of individuals. Evidence from studies in animals
   and humans suggest that physiology and metabolism may be permanently
   affected by ART. It suggests that ART children may be at increased risk
   of later cardiometabolic diseases. Part of this increased susceptibility
   to cardiometabolic diseases seems to be due to parental predisposition,
   while part of the increased susceptibility seems to be due to the ART
   procedure itself. Due to the fast development of new techniques in ART,
   it is unclear whether newer techniques are associated with similar
   risks. There is evidence to suggest that the newer techniques are safer,
   but the rapid developments in reproductive medicine and ever increasing
   indications for ART make it difficult to draw conclusions. Until more is
   known about the effectiveness and safety of ART for the broader
   indications in which ART is currently used, caution in using ART is
   mandatory.
   Further progress could be made if long-term follow-up studies were
   included in the development of new ART techniques. Harmonization of
   measurements in human and animal studies of ART would allow faster
   scientific progress and less scientific waste. Also, including more
   details of the ART procedures in ART registries and allowing follow up
   of ART children through linking registries with already collected data
   from perinatal registries, child health clinics and schools would help
   to provide a better understanding of the growth, development and health
   of the growing population of ART children. Ultimately, these studies
   will provide the much needed information on how to provide ART children
   with the best possible start in life.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality through predation is often selective, particularly at
   life-history bottlenecks. While many studies have looked at the
   importance for survival of specific prey characteristics in isolation,
   few have looked at a broad array of attributes and how they relate to
   survival in a realistic context.
   Our study measures 18 morphological, performance and behavioural traits
   of a juvenile damselfish that have been hypothesized as important for
   prey survival, and examines how they relate to survival in the field
   immediately after settlement. These attributes included size, relative
   false eye-spot size, fast-start escape response kinematics, thigmotaxis,
   laterality, and space use and activity in the field.
   Using conditional inference trees, we identify the most important
   drivers out of a reduced suite of 13 characters. Fast-start response
   latency, boldness, feeding rates and two measures of activity were found
   to significantly contribute to survival. Morphological variables and
   most laboratory measures of performance appeared to contribute little to
   survival.
   Results suggest selection works on a suite of characters associated with
   boldness. Bold and active fish are those that will be best able to learn
   using public information, but because of the relative naivete of newly
   metamorphosed fishes, speed to react to a strike from an unknown
   predator is of critical importance.
   Findings substantiate the ecomorphological paradigm by suggesting that
   selection on behaviour modifies the correlations of morphological and
   performance variables with survival probabilities, since behaviour
   modifies performance capabilities by making them specific to context.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{982-989}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Prey species can respond to the risk of predation with a range of
   antipredator behaviours and physiological changes. While these responses
   increase chances of survival, they often involve feeding reductions and
   greater energy expenditure (e.g. increases in metabolic rate). As a
   consequence, a prey response is constrained by its own nutritional
   condition. While a number of studies indeed demonstrate that prey in
   better nutritional condition have stronger antipredator behaviours, we
   do not yet understand how condition impacts the physiological component
   of the prey's response.
   Previous research revealed that Leptinotarsa decemlineata beetles
   experiencing predation risk improve their offspring's nutritional
   condition by promoting intraclutch egg cannibalism. Importantly, egg
   cannibalism decreased offspring vulnerability by increasing larval
   behavioural responses to chronic predation risk. In this study we test
   if egg cannibalism similarly impacts larval physiological responses by
   comparing how risk of predation in cannibals and non-cannibals affects
   their behaviour (e.g. feeding reductions), metabolic rate and energy
   stores.
   We found that non-cannibals did not exhibit antipredator behaviours but
   responded physiologically, by increasing metabolic rates. In contrast,
   cannibals responded behaviourally, suppressing feeding, but without
   altering metabolism. While cannibals and non-cannibals coupled food
   intake and energy expenditure differently, both reached similar growth
   rates and had similar energy stores when facing chronic predation risk.
   These results indicate that increases in predator avoidance behaviours
   are not merely mirrored by a stronger physiological response. Instead,
   changes in metabolism appear to ameliorate, within our experimental
   conditions, the costs associated with the behavioural response. Prey in
   poorer nutritional state are not less responsive to predators but appear
   to rely more heavily on physiological responses, demonstrating that how
   prey integrates behaviour and physiology depends on their own
   nutritional state.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{334-341}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Picky eating is common in children. Few studies have
   examined predictors of picky eating, and the association of picky eating
   with weight status and dietary quality is inconsistent in the
   literature. We aimed to identify predictors of picky eating and to test
   the association of picky eating with child body mass index z-score
   (BMIz), dietary quality, and micronutrient intake.
   METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a
   randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity among 506 preschoolers
   attending Head Start. Parents completed questionnaires to assess picky
   eating and child temperament. Three 24-hour dietary recalls were
   collected to assess dietary intake. Multivariate regression models
   assessed child, parent, and family predictors of picky eating;
   additional models tested adjusted associations of picky eating with
   child BMIz, dietary quality (measured using the Healthy Eating
   Index-2010), and micronutrient intake.
   RESULTS: Picky eating was predicted by male sex, older child age, and
   more difficult temperament but not race/ethnicity, maternal body mass
   index, maternal depressive symptoms, household food insecurity, or
   single parent home. Picky eating was not associated with child BMIz or
   micronutrient deficiencies; it was inversely associated with total
   Healthy Eating Index-2010 score and servings of whole fruit, total
   vegetables, greens and beans, and total protein foods.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric providers should support parents in expanding the
   number of healthy foods the child eats to improve dietary quality, but
   reassure parents that picky eating is not associated with children's
   weight status or micronutrient deficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with adults, adolescent behavior is often characterized by
   reduced behavioral flexibility, increased sensitivity to reward, and
   increased likelihood to take risks. These traits, which have been
   hypothesized to confer heightened vulnerability to psychopathologies
   such as substance use disorders (SUDs), have been the focus of studies
   in laboratory animal models that seek to understand their neural
   underpinnings. However, rodent studies to date have typically used only
   males and have adopted standard methodological practices (e.g., weight
   loss inducing food restriction) that are likely to have a disparate
   impact on adolescents compared with adults. Here, we used adolescent and
   adult Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes to study instrumental behavior
   tasks that assess behavioral flexibility (strategy shifting and reversal
   learning; Experiment 1), sensitivity to reward value (outcome
   devaluation; Experiment 2), and risky decision making (probability
   discounting; Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, we found that adolescents
   were faster to acquire reversal learning than adults but there were no
   differences in strategy shifting. In Experiments 2 and 3, adolescents
   and adults were equally sensitive to changes in reward value and
   exhibited similar reductions in preference for a large reward when
   reinforcement probability was decreased. However, adolescents responded
   more efficiently and earned reinforcers at a higher rate than their
   same-sex, adult counterparts. Together, these findings provide only
   limited support for the existence of an ``adolescent-typical{''}
   phenotype in Sprague-Dawley rats and instead suggest that age
   differences in the expression of these behaviors may depend on
   conditions such as pubertal status and motivational state.}},

   larvae) were applied to determine the effects on the duration of time in
   substrates following hatch and growth from hatch until emergence. In
   spring 2010, larvae from two full-sib families were individually placed
   into 240 mL perforated plastic containers (n = 263) with gravel
   substrate immediately following hatch. Containers were maintained in
   stream water at ambient temperatures and constant flow (similar to 0.03
   m/sec) in 4 m experimental flowing streams. Duration of time (days) each
   individual remained in the substrate was recorded. Morphological traits
   including total length (mm), body area (mm(2)), and yolk-sac area
   (mm(2)) were measured at hatch and at the time of emergence from
   substrate to compare growth and amount of endogenous yolk reserves used
   in individuals among experimental treatments. Environmental conditions
   significantly affected emergence time. Individuals emerged earlier in
   treatments exposing larvae to chemosensory predator odorants and higher
   conspecific density. Use of endogenous reserves (yolk-sac area) at the
   time of emergence did not differ among treatments. Growth was
   significantly greater when individuals were provided a food source
   compared to all other treatments. Quantifying the magnitude and
   direction of phenotypic responses to environmental conditions is
   important to understand potential factors affecting survival during
   early life stages and population viability under conditions of
   increasing environmental variability.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Incorporation of young people to higher education implies
   the emancipation of the family home, some to share a flat with other
   students or to live in university residences. This fact can influence at
   behavioral level (identity and personality) and health. Specifically,
   social and academic factors can be related to diet in this stage. This
   study aims to describe the level of adherence to the Mediterranean Diet
   (MD) and its association with social and academic factors in a sample of
   Spanish university students, as well as to determine the relationship
   between level of adherence to MD and sex, place of residence, degree and
   religious tendency.
   Material and Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was
   carried out with a sample composed by 597 university students aged
   between 17 and 20 years old (M=19.04; DT=2.71), where 156 were men
   (26.1\%) and 441 women (73.9\%) from the province of Granada and the
   transboundary cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The Questionnaire of
   Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and an ad hoc questionnaire for
   social factors were used to assess the variables for this study. It was
   assessed the prevalence of MD and its association with socio-academic
   factors using a binary logistic regression.
   Results: The results showed that a 70\% of the subjects presented a high
   adherence to MD and a 63.8\% live in their family home. It was shown
   that students living in cross-border cities (Ceuta and Melilla) had
   three times more risk of having a worse adherence to MD than those of
   the peninsula. No differences were found in the dietary pattern
   according to sex, scope of knowledge, domicile or religious tendency.
   Conclusions: It is shown that the quality of the dietary pattern of
   Spanish university students varies according to social factors, such as
   the place of residence and the university campus.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Attractin, is a large multi-domain protein
   which has regulatory functions in multiple physiological processes and
   thus have strong therapeutic potential. In invertebrates, it was first
   identified as a water-borne protein pheromone that plays important role
   in chemical communication and coordinates reproductive activities. But
   its role in mosquitoes/insects remains unknown. Our unexpected discovery
   of attractin homolog from the olfactory tissue of Anopheles culicifacies
   mosquito prompted us to investigate the possible role of Ac-attractin
   (Ac-atrn) in diverse behavioural responses, e.g. feeding, mating and
   other non-genetic stresses.
   Methods: A homology search analysis was performed to identify the full
   length attractin (Ac-atrn) gene of Anopheles culicifacies mosquito. To
   unravel its molecular function during external and internal stresses,
   extensive real-time PCR was performed in the neuro-olfactory tissues of
   the adult mosquitoes as well as in the larval stages. Further, a
   behavioural assay was conducted to elucidate its role in mosquitoes
   mating behaviour.
   Results: The results indicated that Ac-atrn is a 3942 bp long transcript
   which encodes a 1313 amino acid protein, having multiple domains
   including CUB, EGF, Keltch, etc, with 80-90\% homology to other
   insect/mosquito homologs. Ac-atrn gene was dominantly expressed in the
   young larvae and its expression was elevated in response to the fresh
   food supply in the starved larvae. Cold stress temporarily arrested the
   expression of Ac-atrn gene. In case of adult mosquitoes, olfactory and
   brain tissue showed relatively higher expression of Ac-atrn than
   reproductive organs. Although, starvation did not yield significant
   changes in olfactory tissues, but aging and nutritional stress modulated
   Ac-atrn expression in the brain tissue. Furthermore, a circadian rhythm
   dependent change in the expression of Ac-atrn of virgin and mated
   mosquitoes (both sexes), indicates that Ac-atrn might also have a
   pheromone guided role during swarm formation and mating behaviour.
   Interpretation \& conclusion: The relative expression profiling of
   Ac-atrn gene in the larvae during nutritional and cold stress suggested
   its possible role in mediating chemical communication towards the food
   source and in thermal regulation of young larvae. Similarly, it might
   have crucial regulatory role in the stress management and survival of
   adult mosquitoes. The results revealed that Ac-atrn gene is a global
   regulator of many physiological processes in mosquitoes including stress
   response and mating behaviour and thus might be a potential target to
   design novel intervention strategy against mosquitoes.}},

   of actual and apparent competitors}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{593}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{Larvae of several marine invertebrates are known to alter their
   morphology adaptively as a response to changes in conditions, such as
   food and predator density, within plankton communities. In contrast,
   nothing is known about plastic responses to the density of competitors,
   which could signal the potential for food limitation or predation risk.
   We studied effects on trophic morphology of culturing sand dollar
   pluteus larvae with limiting or saturating food and at low or high
   density using 1 of 3 potential competitors: feeding conspecifics,
   feeding heterospecifics, and non-feeding heterospecifics. We
   hypothesized that feeding competitors would induce a morphological
   response similar to limiting food, while the effect of non-feeders would
   depend on whether larvae respond directly to higher density or
   indirectly to food reduction. Plutei cultured with limited food grew
   longer feeding arms and shorter stomachs, though only in higher density
   treatments. Whereas the response to food involved a tradeoff between
   skeleton and stomach growth, larvae responded to high density by in
   creasing in vestment in both, reflecting a more complex set of energetic
   tradeoffs. Similar responses to the presence of feeding and non-feeding
   larvae implicate a sensory mechanism involving signals from potential
   competitors rather than a food decline. Patterns in 2 literature surveys
   of laboratory experiments and field studies suggest that culture density
   is a critical but neglected aspect of experimental design in the study
   of early life-history stages. Larvae are most likely exposed to
   densities sufficient to induce plasticity following synchronous
   spawning, highlighting the importance of natural history in
   understanding density-dependent effects on developmental plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{In behavioral ecology, state-dependent models are frequently used for
   the explanation of inter-individual variance in personality traits.
   Environmental characteristics are one of the external states which could
   influence this variance. The model predicts that environmental harshness
   should be related to fast life-history personality traits and that these
   traits should be more beneficial for fitness-related behavior in a harsh
   environment. In order to test the state-dependent behavior models in
   humans, we explored the relations between environmental harshness
   (exposure to long-term inter-group conflict), HEXACO personality traits
   and mating success (N = 204). We found that exposure to conflict is
   related to a fast life-history personality profile: lower Honesty,
   Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, followed by higher Extraversion.
   Furthermore, interaction effects showed that high Extraversion and low
   Emotionality are related to higher mating success, but only in a harsh
   environment. All obtained results are in line with state-dependent
   models predictions. Research findings reveal the rich explanatory
   potential of behavioral ecological models in explaining key questions of
   human behavior, such as inter-individual variance in personality.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic flexibility is defined as the ability to adapt substrate
   oxidation rates in response to changes in fuel availability. The
   inability to switch between the oxidation of lipid and carbohydrate
   appears to be an important feature of chronic disorders such as obesity
   and type 2 diabetes. Laboratory assessment of metabolic flexibility has
   traditionally involved measurement of the respiratory quotient (RQ) by
   indirect calorimetry during the fasted to fed transition (e.g. mixed
   meal challenge) or during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Under
   these controlled experimental conditions, metabolic inflexibility' is
   characterized by lower fasting fat oxidation (higher fasting RQ) and/or
   an impaired ability to oxidize carbohydrate during feeding or
   insulin-stimulated conditions (lower postprandial or clamp RQ). This
   experimental paradigm has provided fundamental information regarding the
   role of substrate oxidation in the development of obesity and insulin
   resistance. However, the key determinants of metabolic flexibility among
   relevant clinical populations remain unclear. Herein, we propose that
   habitual physical activity levels are a primary determinant of metabolic
   flexibility. We present evidence demonstrating that high levels of
   physical activity predict metabolic flexibility, while physical
   inactivity and sedentary behaviours trigger a state of metabolic
   inflexibility', even among individuals who meet physical activity
   recommendations. Furthermore, we describe alternative experimental
   approaches to studying the concept of metabolic flexibility across a
   range of activity and inactivity. Finally, we address the promising use
   of strategies that aim to reduce sedentary behaviours as therapy to
   improve metabolic flexibility and reduce weight gain risk.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Plasticity, the capacity of an organism to respond to its environment,
   is thought to evolve through changes in development altering the
   integration of environmental cues. In polyphenism, a discontinuous
   plastic response produces two or more phenotypic morphs. Here we
   describe evolutionary change in wing polyphenism and its underlying
   developmental regulation in natural populations of the red-shouldered
   soapberry bug, Jadera haematoloma (Insecta: Hemiptera: Rhopalidae) that
   have adapted to a novel host plant. We find differences in the fecundity
   of morphs in both sexes and in adult expression of insulin signaling
   components in the gonads. Further, the plastic response of
   ancestral-state bugs can be shifted to resemble the reaction norm of
   derived bugs by the introduction of exogenous insulin or RNA
   interference targeting the insulin signaling component encoded by FoxO.
   These results suggest that insulin signaling may be one pathway involved
   in the evolution of this polyphenism, allowing adaptation to a novel
   nutritional environment.}},

Abstract = {{Constructing models of living organisms locating food sources has
   important implications for understanding animal behavior and for the

   simple model of stochastic differential equations for the foraging
   behavior of fish schools in a space including obstacles. The model is

   configurations, they move in limited space with one and two obstacles,
   respectively. Our results reveal that the probability of foraging
   success is highest in the first configuration, and smallest in the third
   one. Furthermore, when school size increases up to an optimal value, the
   probability of foraging success tends to increase. When it exceeds an
   optimal value, the probability tends to decrease. The results agree with

Abstract = {{Individuals frequently show long-term consistency in behaviour over
   their lifetimes, referred to as personality. Various models, revolving
   around the use of resources and how they are valued by individuals,
   attempt to explain the maintenance of these different behavioural types
   within a population, and evaluating them is the key for understanding
   the evolution of behavioural variation. The pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from
   divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking
   individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of
   wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and
   related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual
   reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make
   divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking
   behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as
   condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness
   to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets
   (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire
   adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome
   influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to
   willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear
   to protect their assets however, as estimates of residual reproductive
   value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable
   variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was
   affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the
   models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with
   some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal
   consistency that are more difficult to explain.}},

Abstract = {{The predation pressure and food availability to which individuals are

   with prior experience (predation, starvation or both treatments) or
   measurement condition (with or without the presence of a predator; here,
   the snakehead fish, Channa argus) in the fish species Spinibarbus
   sinensis, known as qingbo. Unexpectedly, prior predator experience
   showed no significant effect on inspection behaviour as demonstrated by
   either the frequency or the duration of each activity outside shelter or
   on cooperation as demonstrated by the inter-individual distance or
   synchronization of speed. This may have been due to the different
   adjustments in behaviour among individuals (more shelter use vs. more
   inspection), the predator treatment used in the present study (exposure
   to caged predator rather than direct predation) and/or a
   species-specific strategy in the qingbo. The starved fish displayed
   shorter inspection latency, increased inspection behaviour and greater
   cooperation when measured without the predator; however, when measured
   in the presence of the predator, the starved fish showed increased
   inspection frequency but shorter inspection duration, possibly due to
   the compromise between energy needs and predation risk. Similar to those
   of the predation group, the fish from the double-treated group showed no
   difference in inspection behaviour compared to the control group under
   the predator-absent condition, while the high-frequency, short-duration
   inspection behaviours remained the same as in the starved group. These

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Outdoor free play is important for preschoolers' physical
   activity, health, and development. Certain temperamental characteristics
   are associated with obesity, nutrition, and sedentary behaviors in
   preschoolers, but the relationship between temperament and outdoor play
   has not been examined. This study examined whether there is an
   association between temperament and outdoor play in young children.
   METHODS: Healthy children aged 1 to 5 years recruited to The Applied
   Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!), a community-based primary care
   research network, from July 2008 to September 2013 were included.
   Parent-reported child temperament was assessed using the Childhood
   Behavior Questionnaire. Outdoor free play and other potential
   confounding variables were assessed through validated questionnaires.
   Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the association
   between temperament and outdoor play, adjusted for potential
   confounders.
   RESULTS: There were 3393 children with data on outdoor play. The
   association between negative affectivity and outdoor play was moderated
   by sex; in boys, for every 1-point increase in negative affectivity
   score, mean outdoor play decreased by 4.7 minutes per day. There was no
   significant association in girls. Surgency was associated with outdoor
   play; for every 1-point increase in surgency/extraversion, outdoor play
   increased by 4.6 minutes per day.
   CONCLUSIONS: Young children's temperamental characteristics were
   associated with their participation in outdoor free play. Consideration
   of temperament could enhance interventions and strategies to increase
   outdoor play in young children. Longitudinal studies are needed to
   elucidate the relationship between children's early temperament and

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioral syndromes can have profound effects on
   individual fitness. Consequently, there is growing recognition that
   knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here
   we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental
   approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist
   with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field
   (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that
   frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral
   syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and
   activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic
   lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in
   morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable
   detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and
   ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make
   important contributions to our understanding of the development and
   proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some
   emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and
   state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered
   the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on
   a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we
   argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal
   personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a
   novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of
   captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally
   compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive
   potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral
   types for release.
   Significance statement
   Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in
   nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We
   summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and
   emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a
   model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological
   consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight
   that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation
   implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs.}},

Abstract = {{Why are some individuals more prone to gamble than others? Animals often
   show preferences between 2 foraging options with the same mean reward
   but different degrees of variability in the reward, and such risk
   preferences vary between individuals. Previous attempts to explain
   variation in risk preference have focused on energy budgets, but with
   limited empirical support. Here, we consider whether biological ageing,
   which affects mortality and residual reproductive value, predicts risk
   preference. We studied a cohort of European starlings (Stumus vulgaris)
   in which we had previously measured developmental erythrocyte telomere
   attrition, an established integrative biomarker of biological ageing. We
   measured the adult birds' preferences when choosing between a fixed
   amount of food and a variable amount with an equal mean. After
   controlling for change in body weight during the experiment (a proxy for
   energy budget), we found that birds that had undergone greater
   developmental telomere attrition were more risk averse as adults than
   were those whose telomeres had shortened less as nestlings.
   Developmental telomere attrition was a better predictor of adult risk
   preference than either juvenile telomere length or early-life food
   supply and begging effort. Our longitudinal study thus demonstrates that
   biological ageing, as measured via developmental telomere attrition, is
   an important source of lasting differences in adult risk preferences.}},

Abstract = {{In a physical model of a thin planktonic layer, the estuarine copepod
   Acartia tonsa strongly avoided weakly stratified layers of dissolved
   chemical compounds from the harmful dinoflagellate Karenia brevis.
   Chemical-induced changes in swimming kinematics allowed copepods to
   effectively avoid the layer and surrounding volume, highlighting the
   relevance of harmful alga-grazer interactions at a distance that involve
   dissolved chemical signals. Avoidance increased significantly with
   increasing chemical concentration representative of a range of
   ecologically relevant bloom conditions (1-10(4) cells/mL equivalent).
   Under mid to maximal bloom conditions, Acartia displayed visually and
   hydrodynamically conspicuous avoidance jumps featuring large, rapid
   displacements with swimming speeds near those reported for predatory
   escape reactions. Previous findings show K. brevis is both toxic and
   nutritionally inadequate to A. tonsa when ingested and that exposure to
   dissolved chemical compounds likely rapidly suppresses effective
   sampling and grazing behaviors. Thus, copepods have strong incentive to
   sense and avoid nearby, spatially discrete patches of toxic algae in
   order to improve fitness by avoiding exposure and/or ingestion and
   associated negative impacts. Our results suggest harmful alga not only
   produce deleterious physiological effects in copepod grazers, but
   chemical-induced behavioral responses also likely alter grazer
   distributions and top-down control via avoidance reactions (reduced
   harmful alga-grazer encounter rates). Additionally, predator-prey
   encounter rates at higher trophic levels are likely enhanced via
   significant changes in copepod swimming kinematics. These combined
   mechanisms could protect and sustain harmful blooms contained in
   subsurface thin layers until blooms reach critical mass and produce
   widespread impacts at the ecosystem level, the ``cryptic bloom{''}
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Diet, nutrition,
   physical inactivity, and obesity have been identified as important
   contributors to the increasing cancer incidence worldwide. To
   effectively plan interventions to reduce cancer incidence and to
   influence the public's decisions regarding health behaviors, it is
   important for professionals to have an understanding of the ways in
   which people understand risk with regard to development of cancer.
   Selecting an appropriate method to evaluate awareness of cancer risk is
   an important consideration. Quantitative approaches such as surveys may
   be used to investigate awareness of risk, and recall of risk factors as
   well as recognition of such factors may form part of such assessments.
   Such quantitative methods may be used to evaluate risk in different
   demographic groups, as well as to examine the link between risk factors
   and behavior. Qualitative approaches include in-depth interviews, focus
   groups, and open-ended survey items and may be used to explain findings
   derived using quantitative methods. Mixed methods approaches may also be
   employed, involving use of a survey as well as interviews or focus
   groups to gather in-depth information. Assessment of awareness of cancer
   risk using an appropriate method has important implications for
   educators, as professionals must evaluate understanding of risk factors
   and tailor messages accordingly for educational programs. Ongoing
   evaluation of awareness is a key part of determining the effectiveness

Abstract = {{Noisy human activities such as helicopter traffic may affect physiology
   and behaviour of wild animals. Since chronic behavioural modifications
   can ultimately alter reproductive success and population dynamics,
   studying the response of different taxa and species to human-induced
   disturbance in different habitats is paramount. The present study
   analysed data collected from 10 male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) monitored
   with GPS collars to assess their response to disturbance caused by
   helicopter overflights. We compared ibex activity levels in the hours
   before and after 34 helicopter overflights during the summer of 2013 in
   Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), a protected area that is essential
   for the conservation of Alpine ibex. The behaviour of Alpine ibex was
   affected both during and after helicopter overflights: compared to the
   average activity levels in the hours before the disturbance event,
   activity increased during the disturbance and decreased during the hour
   following the overflights. The reduction in activity persisted over the
   whole day of the helicopter disturbance and finally went back to normal
   levels during the following day. There was no evidence of habituation to
   the disturbance throughout the study period. The prolonged behavioural
   response to the disturbance suggests that frequent helicopter
   overflights may ultimately affect the ibex's body conditions, as well as
   the life-history traits of a population. These findings highlight the
   importance of considering medium and long-term behavioural responses in
   assessing disturbance-related effects on wildlife populations. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment is a tool used to promote the welfare and

   species (ring-tailed lemurs {[}Lemur catta], red-ruffed lemurs
   {[}Varecia rubra], and Coquerel's sifaka {[}Propithecus coquereli]) to

   method to obtain behavior duration and analyzed our results using ANOVA
   Repeated Measures. Results showed enrichment effectiveness differed for
   each species and that different enrichment devices had varying impacts
   on lemur behavior across all species. We attributed the differences in
   species-specific responses to the unique locomotor patterns and methods
   of diet acquisition of each species, and the variances in behavioral
   responses across all species to the characteristics of each device. Our
   study highlights the importance of species-specific enrichment and

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Life history theory emphasizes the importance of trade-offs in how time
   and energy are allocated to the competing demands of growth, fecundity,
   and survival. However, avian studies have historically emphasized the
   importance of resource acquisition over resource allocation to explain
   geographic variation in fecundity, parental care, and offspring
   development. We compared the brood sizes and nestling mass and feather
   growth trajectories between orange-crowned warblers Oreothlypis celata
   breeding in Alaska versus California, and used 24-h video recordings to
   study the relationship between parental care and growth rates.
   Per-offspring provisioning rates were highest in the smallest broods,
   and food delivery was positively correlated with nestling growth over
   the 24-h period only in Alaska. Females in Alaska spent more time
   brooding, and juveniles there showed faster feather growth and earlier
   mobility compared with those in California. We also found differences in
   the energetic and nutritional content of insect larvae that could
   facilitate the observed differences in nestling growth relative to food
   provisioning. Our results point to the potential importance of food
   quality and parental provisioning of warmth, in addition to food, for
   explaining avian growth patterns. We highlight the need to quantify
   multiple dimensions of parental care and of offspring growth and

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Type 2 diabetes mellitus studies focus on metabolic
   indicators and different self-reported lifestyle or care behaviors.
   Self-reported instruments involve conscious process therefore responses
   might not reflect reality. Meanwhile implicit responses involve
   automatic, unconscious processes underlying social judgments and
   behavior. No studies have explored the combined influence of both
   metabolic indicators and implicit responses on lifestyle practices in
   type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The purpose was to investigate the
   explained variance of socio-demographic, metabolic, anthropometric,
   clinical, psychosocial, cognitive, and lifestyle variables on glycemic
   status and on the ability to adapt to changing demands in people with
   and without type 2 diabetes mellitus in Monterrey, Mexico.
   Methods: Adults with (n=30, mean age 46.90 years old, 33.33\% male) and
   without (n=32, mean age: 41.69 years old, 21.87\% male) type 2 diabetes
   mellitus were studied. Glycemic status was assessed using Bio-Rad D-10
   Hemoglobin A1c Program, which uses ion-exchange high-performance
   chromatography. Stroop 2 test was used to assess the ability to changing
   demands.
   Results: In participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, less years of
   education, negative self-actualization, and higher levels of cholesterol
   and triglycerides explained more than 50\% of the variance in glycemic
   status. In participants without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the variance
   (38.7\%) was explained by total cholesterol, metabolic syndrome,
   high-density lipoprotein, and self-actualization scores; the latter in
   opposite direction. The ability to adapt to changing demands was
   explained by total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, insulin resistance, and
   triglycerides. In participants without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the
   contributing variables were metabolic syndrome and nutrition scores.
   Conclusion: Results showed significant effect on at least one of the
   following variables (socio-demographic, metabolic, or lifestyle
   subscale) on glycemic status in people with and without type 2 diabetes
   mellitus. The ability to adapt to changing demands was explained by
   metabolic variables but only in participants without type 2 diabetes
   mellitus. Preference for unhealthy behaviors (implicit or automatic
   responses) outweighs healthy lifestyle practices in people with and
   without type 2 diabetes mellitus.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims
   Associated with numerous metabolic and behavioral abnormalities, obesity
   is classified by metrics reliant on body weight (such as body mass
   index). However, overnutrition is the common cause of obesity, and may
   independently contribute to these obesity-related abnormalities. Here,
   we use dietary challenges to parse apart the relative influence of diet
   and/or energy balance from body weight on various metabolic and
   behavioral outcomes.
   Materials and methods
   Seventy male mice (mus musculus) were subjected to the diet switch
   feeding paradigm, generating groups with various body weights and
   energetic imbalances. Spontaneous activity patterns, blood metabolite
   levels, and unbiased gene expression of the nutrient-sensing ventral
   hypothalamus (using RNA-sequencing) were measured, and these metrics
   were compared using standardized multivariate linear regression models.
   Results
   Spontaneous activity patterns were negatively related to body weight
   (p<0.0001) but not diet/energy balance (p = 0.63). Both body weight and
   diet/energy balance predicted circulating glucose and insulin levels,
   while body weight alone predicted plasma leptin levels. Regarding gene
   expression within the ventral hypothalamus, only two genes responded to
   diet/energy balance (neuropeptide y{[}npy] and agouti-related peptide
   {[}agrp]), while others were related only to body weight.
   Conclusions
   Collectively, these results demonstrate that individual components of
   obesity-specifically obesogenic diets/energy imbalance and elevated body
   mass-can have independent effects on metabolic and behavioral outcomes.
   This work highlights the shortcomings of using body mass-based indices
   to assess metabolic health, and identifies novel associations between
   blood biomarkers, neural gene expression, and animal behavior following
   dietary challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Preclinical pain assessments can be criticized for failing to adequately
   characterize the human clinical pain experience. Although recent
   assessments have improved upon this shortcoming, there are still
   significant limitations. One concern is that current procedures fail to
   examine underlying motivational drives related to pain. Therefore, we
   used a novel approach-avoidance paradigm that allowed a rat to either
   satisfy hunger or avoid noxious stimulation to reveal prioritizing of
   motivational drives. The operant paradigm utilized a single lever that
   the animal pressed for appetitive reward (approach). The lever press was
   associated with mechanical stimulation of an inflamed paw induced by
   subcutaneous injection of carrageenan (avoidance). The results revealed
   that carrageenan-injected animals had a significant suppression of lever
   pressing and, in addition, had a longer latency to approach and press a
   lever for appetitive reward. The pattern of operant behavioral responses
   indicates that the motivation to avoid pain superseded the motivation to
   alleviate hunger. Utilization of approach-avoidance paradigms, such as
   this one, can allow researchers to unravel the complexities of the pain
   experience with the goal of enhancing translation to clinical efficacy.}},

   food behavior, and energy balance in response to chronic icv.-infusions
   of AngII (200 ng.h(-1)), or Ang(1-7) (200/600 ng.h(-1)) or artificial
   cerebrospinal fluid. High- but not low-dose Ang(1-7) slightly decreased
   weight gain and energy intake in SD rats. AngII showed an anti-obese
   efficacy in SD rats by decreasing energy intake and increasing energy
   expenditure and also improved glucose control. TGR(ASrAOGEN) were
   protected from developing obesity. However, Ang(1-7) did not reveal any
   effects in TGR(ASrAOGEN) and those of AngII were minor compared to SD
   rats. Our results emphasize that brain AngII is a key contributor for
   regulating energy homeostasis and weight in obesity by serving as a
   negative brain-related feedback signal to alleviate weight gain.
   Brain-related anti-obese potency of Ang(1-7) is lower than AngII but
   must be further investigated by using other transgenic models as
   TGR(ASrAOGEN) proved to be less valuable for answering this question.}},

Abstract = {{Inducible behavioral defenses against predators, and how environmental
   factors mediate such responses, have been the focus of behavioral
   ecological research for decades. However, results often remained
   contradictory, perhaps because the ontogenetic context was ignored.
   Here, we investigated how antipredator behavioral responses of common
   toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles are affected by food limitation and how the
   mediated responses changed during larval development. We raised tadpoles
   in the presence or absence of chemical cues indicating predation risk,
   combined with low or high food levels, and repeatedly monitored tadpole
   activity and visibility. We found that the presence of cues indicating
   predation risk and resource availability interactively affected
   visibility, but not relative activity, and this interactive effect
   changed with time over the larval period. Visibility of tadpoles
   decreased with time but to a greater extent when tadpoles were exposed
   to cues indicating predation risk compared to control groups, and this
   difference was more expressed when food was limited. Activity of
   tadpoles also decreased during larval development but to a greater
   extent in case of tadpoles raised in resource-limited environment
   compared to the other treatments. Also, activity of tadpoles was higher
   when food was scarce; however, the magnitude of this effect was not
   influenced by the predator-cue treatment. Thus, in addition to
   describing the trajectories of ontogenetic changes in tadpole behavior,
   our study also demonstrated that responses to environmental factors,
   such as predation threat and food availability, vary with age.
   Antipredator behavior is a common phenomenon in nature, and its
   expression is known to be influenced by the amount of available
   resources. How such defensive responses change with age, however, has
   been studied barely. By repeatedly observing common toad (Bufo bufo)
   tadpoles exposed to predators and/or food limitation, we found that
   tadpoles' activity and visibility decreased with age and did so to a
   greater extent when tadpoles were exposed to chemical cues indicating
   predation risk compared to control groups. Our study demonstrated how
   responses to environmental factors, such as predation threat and food
   availability, vary with age in an important amphibian model species.
   These results draw attention to the importance of considering age when
   studying behavioral responses to environmental change and provide a
   possible explanation for some inconsistencies in the relevant
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases in children.
   Considering the widespread pandemic of pediatric obesity, developing
   more strategies for life style management of this disorder is essential.
   Therefore it was decided to conduct a more comprehensive study for
   prevention and treatment children obesity based on Traditional Persian
   Medicine (TPM). In this review we searched the most important TPM
   textbooks (such as Al-Havi, Al-qanun fit-tib, Kamel al Sanaeh),
   Classical Medicine (CM) text book (Krause's Food and the Nutrition Care
   Process), and scientific databases such as Data sources included
   (Medline, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar) the period from 2000 to 2017
   in terms of obesity management. The keywords Saman Mofrat,
   Setteh-e-Zarurieah, lifestyle, pediatric, children and obesity have been
   used in this search.
   Based on TPM the six essential principles (Setteh-e-Zarurieah) must be
   observed in management of pediatric obesity that these essential factors
   are as follows: air, food and drink, sleep and wakefulness, evacuation
   and retention, body movement, mental movement and repose. Unhealthy
   lifestyle for example irregular sleep, constipation, overeating and
   wrong nutritional habits, insufficient physical activity, and emotional
   excitement, such as sadness and anxiety are plays an important role in
   obesity that confirmed by classical medicine. Moreover, TPM has a
   particular attention to the type of nutrients and their temperament and
   the children's digestion ability. So, further clinical trials should be
   performed to confirm the long-term efficacy of healthy lifestyle in
   pediatric obesity management.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine the effects of early comprehensive interventions
   on home environment and child neurodevelopment among children younger
   than 3 years in poor rural areas of China, as well as the underlying
   mediating and moderating mechanisms. Study design: Non-randomized
   intervention study was conducted among 216 children aged 0-3 years in
   Shanxi province of China. Based on a 2 x 2 factor design, children in
   Lin and Fenxi County were assigned to an intervention group with
   duration less than 1 year (n = 26) or an intervention group with
   duration longer than 1 year (n = 82), while children in Fangshan County
   served as a control group with duration less than 1 year (n = 30) or a
   control group with duration longer than 1 year (n = 78).
   Methods: The control group received national public health services
   (NPHS), while the intervention group received NPHS plus comprehensive
   interventions covering health, nutrition, early psychosocial
   stimulation, and child protection. Home environment (Infant-Toddler Home
   Observation for Measurement of the Environment {[}HOME]) and child
   neurodevelopment (Ages and Stages Questionnaire {[}ASQ]) were measured
   by observation and interview with mothers after the intervention
   program.
   Results: The intervention group showed significantly higher overall
   HOME, organization, learning materials, and involvement than the control
   group, only for a duration longer than 1 year. Children in the
   intervention group performed better in overall ASQ, fine motor,
   problem-solving, and personal-social than children in the control group.
   Moderated mediation analyses indicated that there were significantly
   indirect effects of treatment on overall ASQ through overall HOME,
   organization, and involvement only when the duration was longer than 1
   year.
   Conclusions: Early comprehensive interventions longer than 1 year
   improve home environment and promote child neurodevelopment among
   children younger than 3 years in poor rural areas. What is more, effects
   of early comprehensive interventions longer than 1 year on child
   neurodevelopment were mediated by home environment. (c) 2018 The Royal

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{1. Prey responses to predation risk can affect multiple phenotypic
   traits that have significant implications for
   population-to-ecosystem-level properties. The general stress paradigm
   (hereafter GSP) proposes integrating the principles of ecological
   stoichiometry and prey physiological plasticity in response to predation
   risk to provide an explicit mechanistic framework to evaluate the direct
   influence of predation risk on ecosystem functioning.
   2. However, theoretical attempts evaluating the GSP have focused on only
   one component of phenotypic plasticity, neglecting the fact that
   multiple phenotypic responses can affect nutrient demand and
   consumption, and therefore, the overall animal effect on nutrient
   cycling rates and stoichiometry.
   3. In this study, we used a dynamic state variable model to examine how
   variation in predation and starvation risk on a landscape of patch types
   that vary in food quality affects the behavioural and physiological
   phenotypic responses of prey and the linked nutrient and carbon
   recycling.
   4. We found that the stress imposed by predation risk promotes prey
   carbon limitation, which leads to increased nutrient release and carbon
   uptake due to a stoichiometric mismatch between an animal's demand and
   food stoichiometry. Such effects can be altered by prey shifting
   spatially to carbon- or nutrient-rich patches. However, the abilities of
   prey to cope with new physiological demands can be affected by absolute
   stress level or the predation risk distribution on a spatially implicit
   landscape of stoichiometric-divergent patch type availability. Overall,
   starvation risk can act as a selective force favouring individuals that
   maximize their growth, thus reducing their nutrient release, but
   increasing their exposure to predation risk.
   5. Our results provide an important connection between predator-induced
   stress ecology and ecosystem functioning, linking organism nutrition and
   ecological stoichiometry to fitness outcomes, thus improving our
   understanding of how non-consumptive predator effects can scale up to
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Wild primates that live in urban areas face extreme threats that are
   less frequent in nonurban fragments, such as the presence of dangerous
   matrix elements (e.g., roads, power lines, buildings, and a high density
   of domestic dogs near food patches), that could influence their
   movements, feeding behavior, and survival. However, the scarcity of
   studies addressing this issue hinders our understanding of the
   behavioral adjustments that favor the survival of primates in urban
   areas. For 12 months, we studied a six-individual group of brown howlers
   (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in an urban fragment to determine (i) their
   diet richness and its relationships with food availability, (ii) their
   daily path length (DPL) and the matrix elements used during movement,
   and (iii) the main ecological drivers of the DPL. Sampling effort
   totaled 72 days, 787hr, and 3,224 instantaneous scans. We found that the
   diet of brown howlers contained 35 plant species (including seven
   cultivated crops) belonging to 33 genera and 21 families. The
   consumption of fruits and young leaves was directly related to their
   temporal availability. The average DPL (446m) was smaller than that
   reported for groups of howlers inhabiting large nonurban fragments. To
   move between food patches, animals used three main matrix elements:
   trees, power lines, and roofs. The number of plant species used during
   the day was the main driver of DPL. Our findings highlighted that the
   generalist-opportunistic diet of brown howlers and their ability to move
   across the anthropogenic matrix using artificial elements such as power
   lines, roofs, and wildlife crossings represent a remarkable part of
   their behavioral repertory in Lami. However, there are potential costs
   associated with these strategies, namely, electrocution and predation by
   domestic dogs. Thus, it is urgent to further investigate how these
   behaviors could affect the long-term survival of these animals.
   The brown howlers inhabited a highly disturbed area, and had a varied
   diet composed of 28 native plant species and 7 cultivated crops. The
   average daily path length (446m) was similar to that reported for groups
   inhabiting nonurban small fragments (544m), but smaller the than that
   reported for nonurban large fragments (658m). Animals used trees, power
   lines, and roofs to move between food patches and/or sleeping sites. The
   daily path length was mainly affected (directly) by the number of plant
   species used/day and, to a lesser extent, by the consumption of mature
   leaves. The potential costs associated with these behavioral strategies,
   namely, electrocution and predation by domestic dogs may be high in the
   long run.}},

Abstract = {{The ideal free distribution assumes that animals select habitats that
   are beneficial to their fitness. When the needs of dependent offspring
   differ from those of the parent, ideal habitat selection patterns could
   vary with the presence or absence of offspring. We test whether habitat
   selection depends on reproductive state due to top-down or bottom-up
   influences on the fitness of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou), a threatened, wide-ranging herbivore. We combined established
   methods of fitting resource and step selection functions derived from
   locations of collared animals in Ontario with newer techniques,
   including identifying calf status from video collar footage and seasonal
   habitat selection analysis through latent selection difference
   functions. We found that females with calves avoided predation risk and
   proximity to roads more strongly than females without calves within
   their seasonal ranges. At the local scale, females with calves avoided
   predation more strongly than females without calves. Females with calves
   increased predation avoidance but not selection for food availability
   upon calving, whereas females without calves increased selection for
   food availability across the same season. These behavioral responses
   suggest that habitat selection by woodland caribou is influenced by
   reproductive state, such that females with calves at heel use habitat
   selection to offset the increased vulnerability of their offspring to
   predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{To preserve biodiversity, identifying at-risk populations and developing
   conservation plans to mitigate the effects of human-induced rapid

   for food-limited species, can aid in detecting populations being
   impacted by HIREC, and characterizing the quality, abundance, and

   provide insight concerning the likelihood of a species persisting in a
   changing environment. We used Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) nesting
   in the Florida Everglades as a model system to study the possible
   effects of HIREC on a food-limited population. We compared the diets of
   Wood Storks in 2013 and 2014 with those reported during the 1970s before
   major anthropogenic activities affected the Everglades system and prey
   availability. Wood Storks in our study consumed more large-bodied
   sunfish species (Lepomis spp.), fewer native marsh fishes, and more
   non-native fish species than during the 1970s. Large sunfish and
   non-native fish are relatively rare in the drying pools of Everglades
   marshes where storks traditionally forage, suggesting that Wood Storks
   may be using novel foraging habitats such as created wetlands (i.e.,
   canals and stormwater ponds). Although created wetlands have long
   hydroperiods conducive to maintaining large-bodied fishes and could
   provide alternative foraging habitat when prey availability is reduced

Abstract = {{Animal `personality', the phenomenon of consistent individual
   differences in behaviour within populations, has been documented widely,
   yet its functional significance and the reasons for its persistence
   remain unclear. One possibility is that among-individual behavioural
   variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on
   resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool
   prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk
   exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified
   open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual
   (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this
   species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent
   with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in
   size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high
   repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP
   (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations
   between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that
   individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not
   consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome'
   in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated
   with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some
   individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources,
   while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration
   (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource
   patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited
   resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality
   variation observed in wild populations. (C) 2018 The Association for the

   higher child BMI Z-scores at 5-7 years. More emotional children were

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Regret can be defined as the subjective experience of recognizing that
   one has made a mistake and that a better alternative could have been
   selected. The experience of regret is thought to carry negative utility.
   This typically takes two distinct forms: augmenting immediate postregret
   valuations to make up for losses, and augmenting long-term changes in
   decision-making strategies to avoid future instances of regret
   altogether. While the short-term changes in valuation have been studied
   in human psychology, economics, neuroscience, and even recently in
   nonhuman-primate and rodent neurophysiology, the latter long-term
   process has received far less attention, with no reports of regret
   avoidance in nonhuman decision-making paradigms. We trained 31 mice in a
   novel variant of the Restaurant Row economic decision-making task, in
   which mice make decisions of whether to spend time from a limited budget
   to achieve food rewards of varying costs (delays). Importantly, we
   tested mice longitudinally for 70 consecutive days, during which the
   task provided their only source of food. Thus, decision strategies were
   interdependent across both trials and days. We separated principal
   commitment decisions from secondary reevaluation decisions across space
   and time and found evidence for regret-like behaviors following
   change-of-mind decisions that corrected prior economically
   disadvantageous choices. Immediately following change-of-mind events,
   subsequent decisions appeared to make up for lost effort by altering
   willingness to wait, decision speed, and pellet consumption speed,
   consistent with past reports of regret in rodents. As mice were exposed
   to an increasingly reward-scarce environment, we found they adapted and
   refined distinct economic decision-making strategies over the course of
   weeks to maximize reinforcement rate. However, we also found that even
   without changes in reinforcement rate, mice transitioned from an early
   strategy rooted in foraging to a strategy rooted in deliberation and
   planning that prevented future regret-inducing change-of-mind episodes
   from occurring. These data suggest that mice are learning to avoid
   future regret, independent of and separate from reinforcement rate
   maximization.}},

   environmental intervention - intermittent fasting (IF) - and then
   evaluated for alterations in exploratory, anxiety and learning and
   memory behaviors. Although no significant effects on spatial memory were
   observed, mutant mice showed impaired contextual fear memory in the
   passive avoidance test - an outcome that was effectively rescued by IF.
   In this study, we demonstrated that IF modulation, in addition to its
   rescue of the memory deficit, was also required to uncover behavioral
   phenotypes otherwise hidden in this neuronal Pten haploinsufficiency
   model.}},

Title = {{Dispersal-competition tradeoff in microbiomes in the quest for land
   colonization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Ancestor microbes started colonizing inland habitats approximately 2.7
   to 3.5 billion years ago. With some exceptions, the key physiological
   adaptations of microbiomes associated with marine-to-land transitions
   have remained elusive. This is essentially caused by the lack of
   suitable systems that depict changes in microbiomes across sufficiently
   large time scales. Here, we investigate the adaptive routes taken by
   microbiomes along a contemporary gradient of land formation. Using
   functional trait-based metagenomics, we show that a switch from a
   microbial `dispersal' to a `competition' response modus best
   characterizes the microbial trait changes during this eco-evolutionary
   trajectory. The `dispersal' modus prevails in microbiomes at the
   boundary sites between land and sea. It encompasses traits conferring
   cell chemosensory and motile behaviors, thus allowing the local microbes
   to exploit short-lived nutritional patches in high-diffusion
   microhabitats. A systematic transition towards the `competition' modus
   occurs progressively as the soil matures, which is likely due to forces
   of viscosity or strain that favor traits for competition and chemical
   defense. Concomitantly, progressive increases in the abundances of genes
   encoding antibiotic resistance and complex organic substrate degradation
   were found. Our findings constitute a novel perspective on the ecology
   and evolution of microbiome traits, tracking back one of the most
   seminal transitions in the evolutionary history of life.}},

   modelling approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Animal behaviour is increasingly seen as an important component in
   maintaining functional connectivity between patches in fragmented
   landscapes. However, models that explicitly incorporate behavioural
   trade-offs are rarely applied to landscape planning problems like
   connectivity. The aim of this study was to explore how state-dependent
   behaviour influenced functional connectivity between patches from a
   theoretical perspective. We investigated how inter-patch distances
   influenced functional connectivity using a dynamic state variable model
   framework. The decision making process of an individual ruminant facing
   fitness trade-offs in staying in its patch of origin or moving to
   another patch at various distances were explicitly modelled. We
   incorporated energetic costs and predation costs of feeding, ruminating,
   and resting while in the patch and for transit between patches based on
   inter-patch distance. Functional connectivity was maintained with
   isolated patches when they offered high intake and the inactivity of
   rumination associated with rapid gut fill resulted in reduced predation
   risk. Nevertheless, individuals in high energetic state often would
   forgo moving to another patch, whereas individuals in poor energetic
   states were forced to accept the cost of movement to best meet their
   requirements in the distant patch. The inclusion of state-dependent
   behavioural models provides important insights into functional
   connectivity in fragmented landscapes and helps integrate animal
   behaviour into landscape planning. We discuss the consequences of our
   findings for landscape planning to show how the approach provides a
   heuristic tool to assess alternative scenarios for restoring landscape
   functional connectivity.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1881}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Who takes risks, and when? The relative state model proposes two
   non-independent selection pressures governing risk-taking: need-based
   and ability-based. The need-based account suggests that actors take
   risks when they cannot reach target states with low-risk options
   (consistent with risk-sensitivity theory). The ability-based account
   suggests that actors engage in risk-taking when they possess traits or
   abilities that increase the expected value of risk-taking (by increasing
   the probability of success, enhancing payoffs for success or buffering
   against failure). Adaptive risk-taking involves integrating both
   considerations. Risk-takers compute the expected value of risk-taking
   based on their state-the interaction of embodied capital relative to
   one's situation, to the same individual in other circumstances or to
   other individuals. We provide mathematical support for this dual pathway
   model, and show that it can predict who will take the most risks and
   when (e.g. when risk-taking will be performed by those in good, poor,
   intermediate or extreme state only). Results confirm and elaborate on
   the initial verbal model of state-dependent risk-taking: selection
   favours agents who calibrate risk-taking based on implicit computations
   of condition and/or competitive (dis)advantage, which in turn drives
   patterned individual differences in risk-taking behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Wild-living animals are subject to weather variability that may cause
   the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress
   and tissue damage, potentially driving demographic responses. Our 3-yr
   field study investigated the effects of seasonal weather conditions on
   biomarkers for oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and antioxidant
   defense in the European badger (Meles meles). We found age class
   effects: cubs were more susceptible to oxidative stress and oxidative
   damage than adults, especially very young cubs in the spring, when they
   also exhibited lower antioxidant biomarkers than adults. Although
   previous studies have found that intermediate spring and summer rainfall
   and warmer temperatures favor cub survival, counterintuitively these
   conditions were associated with more severe oxidative damage. Oxidative
   damage was high in cubs even when antioxidant biomarkers were high. In
   contrast, adult responses accorded with previous survival analyses.
   Wetter spring and summer conditions were associated with higher
   oxidative damage, but they were also associated with higher antioxidant
   biomarkers. Autumnal weather did not vary substantially from normative
   values, and thus effects were muted. Winter carryover effects were
   partially evident, with drier and milder conditions associated with
   greater oxidative damage in the following spring but also with higher
   antioxidant capacity. Plausibly, warmer conditions promoted more badger
   activity, with associated metabolic costs at a time of year when food
   supply is limited. Modeling biomarkers against projected climate change
   scenarios predicted greater future risks of oxidative damage, although
   not necessarily exceeding antioxidant capacity. This interdisciplinary
   approach demonstrates that individual adaptive physiological responses
   are associated with variation in natural environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-predator behavior can be costly to prey species and the
   consequences of these decisions may affect survival. Interactions
   between humans and hunted species can lead to behavioral shifts in the
   animal that affect hunter satisfaction and possibly fitness of the
   animals. We assessed the influence of multiple factors that may affect
   anti-predator behavior in a commonly harvested game bird, the northern
   bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), during October 2013-March 2015 on a
   private plantation in South Carolina, USA. We monitored bobwhite-hunter
   interactions during hunting events (n=40) using radio-telemetry and
   behavioral observations. We investigated bobwhite anti-predator behavior
   in 2 contexts, choice of evasive tactic and timing of tactic deployment
   (i.e., level of wariness), using a combination of linear regression and
   multinomial models in a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate the
   approach style of the hunter (i.e., pointing dog) and vegetation density
   affect the evasive tactic used. Dense vegetation at 0.6m above ground
   height promoted hiding behavior of bobwhites, whereas approaching
   pointing dogs (i.e., not holding point) promoted flushing. Also, dense
   vegetation at 0.3m above ground height and previous exposure to a
   discharged firearm elicited an earlier anti-predator response. Our
   results imply that bobwhites make context-specific decisions regarding
   hunter evasion, which may be a result of associative learning. Managers
   may be able to increase bobwhite-hunter encounters and improve hunter
   satisfaction by maintaining vegetation structure between 0.6 and 1.3m to
   promote hiding behavior throughout the hunting season. (c) 2018 The
   Wildlife Society.
   During hunter interactions, bobwhites held more frequently in dense
   vegetation 0.6m above ground height, flushed more often when encountered
   by moving pointing dogs, and exhibited learning behaviors from previous
   exposure to hunters. Proper vegetation management to provide the optimal
   structure while minimizing dense vegetation (i.e., mat forming grasses)
   at the ground level will foster increased opportunities to detect coveys
   and improve hunter satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{An organism's life history strategy is made up of a suite of
   physiological, behavioral, and ecological traits, which vary at both the
   interspecific and intraspecific levels in accordance with selective
   pressures operating on individuals. For birds, 2 primary ecological
   factors have been proposed to explain intraspecific and interspecific
   variation in nestling growth: nest predation and food availability.
   Individual nestling growth rates have important consequences for overall
   fitness because growth speed could influence subsequent reproductive
   performance and survival. We studied the relationship between ecological
   factors (i.e. precipitation level and predation rate) and nestling
   growth patterns of 2 New World flycatcher species (Tyrannidae) of the
   genus Tyrannus (Fork-tailed Flycatcher {[}T. savana] and Scissor-tailed
   Flycatcher {[}T. forficatus]) breeding at south- and north-temperate
   latitudes. We tested the hypothesis that nestling growth rates are
   driven by nest predation rates and predicted that nestling growth rates
   would be higher in species experiencing higher nest predation rates. We
   also tested the hypothesis that nestling growth rates are related to
   precipitation levels (a proxy for food abundance) and predicted that
   nestling growth rates would be higher at sites with higher precipitation
   levels. Growth rate was not associated with predation rate, but it
   varied with precipitation level, with faster nestling growth rates
   during wet years for the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher living at
   north-temperate latitudes. Among species, similar growth rates were
   found during wet years. These results indicate that, at least as
   proximate causes, precipitation explains intraspecific and interspecific
   growth rate variation in Tyrannus species to a larger degree than
   predation. Additionally, the variation in growth rate we observed
   between wet and dry years indicates a high level of plasticity in growth
   rate in this group of insectivorous birds.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Studies at small spatial scale are often fundamental to highlight the
   behavioural plasticity of a species and thus have important implications
   for conservation planning, in particular for species usually considered
   as habitat specialists. We investigated second-order habitat selection
   of the European pine marten in an area dominated by deciduous oak forest
   and open fields in central Italy, by radio-tracking 16 pine martens
   (eight males, eight females). Pine martens placed home ranges in areas
   with more open field than in the study area, whereas woodland (oak and
   conifer forests) comprised a smaller portion of the home range than
   predominant forest character of the studied area. Although the presence
   of the species in the open habitats has been documented, to our
   knowledge, our results provide the first evidence of home range
   establishment in this cover type by pine marten at population level. The
   combination of low predation risk and high availability of resources
   could allow pine martens to occupy open fields in our study area. We
   highlighted different individual strategies of habitat selection, with
   some individuals placing home ranges in areas with high forest coverage
   while others occupying open areas. We found no effects of sex and body
   condition on habitat selection, and this could indicate that in the
   study area, both forested and non-forested cover types, such as open
   fields, shrub and anthropic areas, can provide adequate food, overhead
   cover and resting sites for all individuals. Pine marten ability to
   occupy open fields seems thus more related to the behavioural
   flexibility of the species, rather than to the need to supplement dens
   and forage from complementary lower quality habitat. The high quality of
   the Mediterranean continental area studied could also explain the
   selection of open areas by the pine marten. Our results offer useful
   information on pine marten ecology and may be helpful for conservation
   management of this species in southern Europe.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sulfation of biomolecules, like phosphorylation, is one of the most
   fundamental and ubiquitous biochemical modifications with important
   functions during detoxification. This process is reversible, involving
   two enzyme classes: a sulfotransferase, which adds a sulfo group to a
   substrate; and a sulfatase that removes the sulfo group. However, unlike
   phosphorylation, the role of sulfation in organismal development is
   poorly understood. In this study, we find that two independent sulfation
   events regulate the development of mouth morphology in the nematode
   Pristionchus pacificus. This nematode has the ability to form two
   alternative mouth morphologies depending on environmental cues, an
   example of phenotypic plasticity. We found that, in addition to a
   previously described sulfatase, a sulfotransferase is involved in
   regulating the mouth-form dimorphism in P. pacificus. However, it is
   unlikely that both of these sulfation-associated enzymes act upon the
   same substrates, as they are expressed in different cell types.
   Furthermore, animals mutant in genes encoding both enzymes show
   condition-dependent epistatic interactions. Thus, our study highlights
   the role of sulfation-associated enzymes in phenotypic plasticity of
   mouth structures in Pristionchus.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that immune-challenged individuals need to

   explored whether fighting an infection has an effect on hiding behaviour

   respond differently from those from natural forested ponds.
   Independently of habitat type, we found no evidence for changes in

   challenged (injected with lipopolysaccharide) or not (injected with
   phosphate-buffered saline). We also explored whether immune response
   (phytohaemagglutinin assay) or morphological traits (head width, body
   condition, body size and length) were related to variation in hiding
   time, but we did not find a relationship between the measured traits and
   behavioural response for males from either habitat. In conclusion, we

Abstract = {{Background: The significance of decision-making in suicidal behaviour is
   often highlighted; however, the performance of persons in suicide crisis
   is unknown. This study aimed to explore the comprehensive decision
   making profile of depressed patients following a suicide attempt.
   Methods: Decision-making was measured by reward- ({''}ABCD{''}) and
   punishment- ({''}EFGH{''}) sensitive versions of the Iowa Gambling Task
   (IGT) in 59 medication-free depressed patients within 72 h after a
   suicide attempt and in 46 healthy control subjects. Severity of
   depressive symptoms was assessed in the patient group by the Hamilton
   Depression Rating Scale.
   Results: Performance of the two groups differed significantly on the IGT
   ABCD, while a trend towards significant differences was seen on the IGT
   EFGH. Severity of depressive symptoms did not affect the depressed
   participants' decision-making performance.
   Limitations: Subjects were not matched for years of education.
   Administration of the IGT ABCD and IGT EFGH was not counterbalanced.
   Methods of suicide attempts and history of previous attempts were not
   collected.
   Conclusions: Individuals with a recent suicide attempt showed
   decision-making dysfunction on both IGT versions. However, on the EFGH,
   the overall difference between groups was not significant, depressed
   participants' performance remained poor during all blocks. Their
   behaviour reflected a focus on best immediate possible outcomes, not
   regarding future adverse consequences. This could be a result of
   psychological and cognitive alterations which modulate suicidal
   behaviour independent from mood. Further longitudinal studies should
   verify this possibility. Investigation of state-dependent
   neuropsychological characteristics of suicidal behaviour might be
   essential for detecting acute suicidal crisis.}},

   endpoints, life-history traits, and population dynamics. Blood samples
   (N = 70) were collected in South polar skuas during two breeding
   periods, in 2003 and 2005, and individuals were annually monitored until
   2011. Multi-state mark recapture models were used to test the effects of
   POP levels on demographic traits. Survival rate and long-term breeding
   probability were not related to individual POP levels, whereas long-term
   breeding success significantly decreased with increasing blood levels of
   mirex, an organochlorine insecticide. At the proximate level,
   corticosterone (stress hormone) and prolactin (parental care hormone)
   levels were not linked to individual POP burden. Nest defense in 2005
   was significantly less intensive in chick-rearing skuas bearing higher
   mirex levels, suggesting reproductive behavioral impairment. Matrix
   population models were then built to project the rate of population
   decline according to increasing mirex burden. Although mirex levels were
   2.8 times higher in 2003 than in 2005, the population-level effect of
   mirex was only detected in 2005, the year of higher corticosterone
   levels. The combination of endocrine traits with demographic analysis
   thereby enables to provide new support of synergistic interactions
   between pollutants and stress levels on long-term breeding outputs and
   population dynamics. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Existing programs which aim to prevent and treat childhood obesity often
   do not take into account individual variation and the underlying
   mechanisms that impact child eating behavior. Individual differences in
   children's appetitive traits have been shown to appear as early as
   during infancy and become more pronounced as children grow older and
   become more exposed to the obesogenic food environment. Differences in
   genetic predispositions interacting with factors in children's early
   environment account in part for individual differences in appetitive
   traits. It is very likely that obesogenic eating phenotypes manifest
   themselves before the onset of childhood obesity. If so, identifying
   these phenotypes early is expected to move primary prevention strategies
   in a new direction and holds great potential to significantly enhance
   our ability to prevent childhood obesity. The aim of this narrative
   review is to discuss the role of behavioral phenotyping as an innovative
   approach for the development of more personalized obesity prevention and
   treatment interventions that are tailored to children's individual
   predispositions. We describe several examples of appetitive traits which
   have been linked to overeating and excess weight gain in children and
   thus may represent modifiable risk factors for future interventions. The
   review concludes with a comprehensive synthesis of opportunities for
   future human ingestive behavior research on identifying behavioral
   phenotypes for childhood obesity.}},

Abstract = {{The current obesogenic environment promotes physical inactivity and food
   consumption in excess of energy requirements, two important modifiable
   risk factors influencing energy balance. Habitual physical activity has
   been shown to impact not only energy expenditure, but also energy intake
   through mechanisms of appetite control. This review summarizes recent
   theory and evidence underpinning the role of physical activity in the
   homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms controlling appetite. Energy
   intake along the spectrum of physical activity levels (inactive to
   highly active) appears to be J-shaped, with low levels of physical
   activity leading to dysregulated appetite and a mismatch between energy
   intake and expenditure. At higher levels, habitual physical activity
   influences homeostatic appetite control in a dual-process action by
   increasing the drive to eat through greater energy expenditure, but also
   by enhancing post-meal satiety, allowing energy intake to better match
   energy expenditure in response to hunger and satiety signals. There is
   clear presumptive evidence that physical activity energy expenditure can
   act as a drive (determinant) of energy intake. The influence of physical
   activity level on non-homeostatic appetite control is less clear, but
   low levels of physical activity may amplify hedonic states and
   behavioural traits favouring overconsumption indirectly through
   increased body fat. More evidence is required to understand the
   interaction between physical activity, appetite control and diet
   composition on passive overconsumption and energy balance. Furthermore,
   potential moderators of appetite control along the spectrum of physical
   activity, such as body composition, sex, and type, intensity and timing
   of physical activity, remain to be fully understood.}},

   attractiveness due to risk perception. Across treatments individuals in

Abstract = {{Variation in intrinsic (body mass, reproductive condition) and extrinsic
   factors (habitat quality, spatio-temporal variation in food
   availability) can affect the costs and benefits of personality traits.
   Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with
   changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using
   capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red
   squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness
   and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the
   sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under
   different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the
   number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an
   individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of
   presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure
   exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival
   differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better
   than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study
   areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for
   bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated
   with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female
   reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the
   tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types.
   Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor
   food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary
   with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food
   resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red
   squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes.
   Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival
   or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between
   personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels
   under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration
   using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red
   squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food
   availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests
   with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy
   females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower
   body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to
   produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations
   of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in
   relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenisms, where multiple, discrete, environmentally-cued phenotypes
   can arise from a single genotype, are extreme forms of phenotypic
   plasticity. Cue acquisition and interpretation are vital for matching
   phenotypes to varying environments, but can be difficult if cues are
   unreliable indicators or if multiple cues are present simultaneously.
   Facultative paedomorphosis, where juvenile traits are retained at sexual
   maturity, is a density-dependent polyphenism exhibited by many
   salamanders. Favorable conditions such as low larval densities and
   stable hydroperiod delay metamorphosis and promote a paedomorphic
   strategy. We investigated proximate cues affecting facultative
   paedomorphosis in order to understand how larval newts (Notophthalmus
   viridescens louisianensis) assess conspecific density. To isolate the
   effects of density cues from the effects of resources and agonistic
   behavior, we caged larval newts in mesocosms in a 2 x 2 factorial design
   that manipulated both background larval newt densities (high or low) and
   food levels (ambient or supplemented). We found strong effects of both
   food and density on caged individuals. Under high densities, caged
   larvae were more likely to become efts, a long-lasting juvenile
   terrestrial stage, across both food levels, while paedomorphs were more
   common under low densities. Though food levels increased growth rates,
   density had strong independent effects on metamorphic timing and
   phenotype. Competition for food and space are classical
   density-dependent processes, but density cues themselves may be a
   mediator of density-dependent effects on polyphenisms and life history
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual ornaments contribute substantially to phenotypic diversity and it
   is particularly relevant to understand their evolution. Ornaments can
   assume the function of signals-of-quality that the choosy sex uses to
   evaluate potential mating partners. Often there are no obvious direct
   benefits and investment into mate choice is primarily rewarded by
   beneficial alleles that are inherited to the offspring. Inter-sexual
   communication via sexual ornaments requires honesty of the sexual
   signal, yet the question of what maintains honesty remains only
   partially solved. One solution is that honesty is maintained by trait
   expression being dependent on individual condition, since
   condition-dependent trait expression offers an effectively inexhaustible
   source of genetic variability. Here we test in the highly sexually
   dimorphic club-legged grasshopper Gomphocerus sibiricus if putative
   sexual ornaments, in particular the striking front-leg clubs, are more
   strongly affected by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immune challenge than
   putatively not sexually selected traits. Our results show overall little
   condition-dependent expression of morphological and song traits, with
   sexually selected traits exhibiting effects comparable to nonsexually
   selected traits (with the possible exception of stridulatory file length
   and syllable-to-pause ratio in advertisement songs). Interestingly,
   field observations of individuals of lethally parasitized individuals
   suggest that a very strong environmental challenge can specifically
   affect the expression of the front-leg clubs. The presence of 1\% of
   males in natural populations with missing or heavily deformed clubs plus
   5\% with minor club deformations furthermore indicate that there are
   risks associated with club development during final ecdysis and this
   might act as a filter against deleterious alleles.}},

Abstract = {{Background/objectives Previous studies have shown that the temperament
   traits are related to risk factors for chronic diseases, which could be
   partly explained by lifestyle habits. However, little is known whether
   temperament traits associate with diet. The aim of this study was to
   examine the cross-sectional associations between temperament traits and
   the whole diet.
   Subjects/methods We studied 1668 men and women, aged 56-70, from the
   Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Temperament was measured using the
   Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Information on diet was
   collected by a validated 128-item food frequency questionnaire. The
   associations of temperament traits; novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance
   (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P), with diet were tested
   by linear regression analysis.
   Results After adjustment for potential confounders, greater HA was
   related to poorer diet quality, including lower consumption of
   vegetables, fruits, fish and several vitamins RD was associated with
   healthier diet quality, including higher consumption of vegetables and
   intake of vitamin E and lower intake of alcohol. NS was significantly
   related to higher intake of fish, fat and alcohol and lower consumption
   of cereals, milk products and carbohydrates. No significant associations
   between P and intake of foods and nutrients were observed.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that there is an association between
   temperament traits and diet. Especially greater HA seems to associate
   with poorer diet quality and greater RD with healthier diet quality.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals vary greatly in the distance they disperse, and in doing so,

   on dispersal and the interaction between environment and phenotype
   remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to
   measure how dispersal distance was affected by phenotype, environment
   experienced before and after metamorphosis, and their interaction. We
   manipulated the environment encountered by a pond-breeding salamander
   Ambystoma annulatum during the aquatic larval stage and again as
   dispersing terrestrial juveniles. After assaying juvenile phenotype

   the initial distance dispersed by juveniles. The distance moved by
   dispersing salamanders was affected by attributes of both larval and
   juvenile habitat, with salamanders that encountered low quality habitat
   in either life stage moving the farthest. However, we did not find
   support for an interactive effect of phenotype and environment affecting
   the distance moved by dispersers. Interestingly, exploration behavior
   explained the distance moved by philopatric animals but not dispersing
   ones. Our findings indicate that the environment experienced before
   metamorphosis can affect juvenile dispersal behavior, and demonstrates
   the need to consider dispersal in species with complex life cycles to

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{49-57}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Thermoregulatory behaviours are of great importance for ectotherms
   buffering against the impact of temperature extremes. Such behaviours
   bring not only benefits but also organism level costs such as decreased
   food availability and foraging efficiency and thus lead to energetic
   costs and metabolic consequences. However, there remains an important
   gap in our knowledge to link thermoregulatory behaviour to population
   level ecological consequences. Aphids, as ectothermic invertebrates, can
   escape from thermal extremes by either dropping off the plant they are
   on or moving to suitable microclimates. Here we used the English grain
   aphid, Sitobion avenae, as a model system to test the hypothesis that
   aphids may behaviourally avoid heat stress while also altering their
   microhabitat utilization leading to demographic consequences. We found
   that heat stress drove the aphids to leave their host plant; this
   reduction in host plant residence was associated with increasing leaf
   temperatures indicating that aphids exhibit thermoregulatory behaviour
   to escape heat stress. Specifically, we found that behavioural
   thermoregulation made the aphids disperse and redistribute themselves
   within different microclimates and thus led to changes in microhabitat
   utilization. We also discovered that leaving the host plant during
   behavioural thermoregulation resulted in a considerable decrease in
   aphids' survival probability due to their inefficient relocation to
   other plants and increased risk of starvation. Finally, we found that
   the aphids' thermoregulatory behaviour prevented heat stress while
   concurrently resulting in decreased survival and reproduction. Together,
   these findings support our hypothesis that behavioural thermoregulation
   alters microhabitat utilization and demographic rates in aphids. This
   study highlights the importance of behavioural thermoregulation and its
   ecological consequences and has important implications for understanding
   population responses in the context of current climate change. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Animals are able to modify their behaviour in response to changes in
   their internal and environmental state. The asset protection principle
   predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result
   of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would
   incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take
   fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of
   this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of
   RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the
   widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of
   female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various
   points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on
   risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after
   a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open
   arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV
   on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater
   levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby
   offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for
   state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour. (C) 2018 The

   behaviour and hormones varied between habitats. Males in urban habitat
   had more extensive brown spotting than rural males. The relationship
   between melanin coloration and territoriality differed in urban and
   rural habitats. In rural sparrows, territoriality was negatively
   correlated with spotting area, while in urban sparrows territoriality
   was positively associated with spotting darkness. Regardless of habitat,
   males with more extensive spotting increased testosterone secretion more
   in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration and males
   with darker spotting had greater handling restraint-induced release of
   corticosterone. This suggests that plumage coloration is associated with
   underlying physiology, but the relationship between coloration and
   behaviour may shift between habitats. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Regulation of mass in small birds is based on simultaneously minimizing
   starvation and predation risk, but the mechanisms birds use to assess
   starvation risk are still debated. While we know that birds anticipate
   periods of unpredictable food availability/energy expenditure (e.g. the
   winter and night) by increasing their fat reserves, we do not know
   whether this anticipation involves learning. This study investigated
   whether birds could learn to use a light cue that predicted a period of
   food unavailability, to adaptively regulate their foraging and/or body
   weight. Sixteen captive starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were subjected to
   42 days of an irregular schedule of food deprivation that involved
   depriving them of food for 5 h on 20 pseudorandomly chosen days. Birds
   were randomly allocated to two treatment groups for which a 30 min
   period of reduced ambient light either provided perfect information
   (Predictable) or no information (Unpredictable) about upcoming food
   deprivation. Both groups of birds increased their dawn body mass over
   the period of the experiment, consistent with a response to
   unpredictable food deprivation. However, no differences in either
   foraging behaviour or dawn body mass emerged between the groups,
   suggesting that the Predictable birds were unable to learn to use the
   light cue to initiate anticipatory foraging ahead of food deprivation.
   Furthermore, both groups immediately decreased their foraging behaviour
   in response to the onset of the light cue, suggesting that starlings do
   not have an evolved anticipatory foraging response to low light levels.
   Further work is needed to test alternative cues and designs before any
   general conclusions can be drawn regarding the flexibility of
   anticipatory foraging. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Early life stressors can impair song in songbirds by negatively
   impacting brain development and subsequent learning. Even in species in
   which only males sing, early life stressors might also impact female
   behavior and its underlying neural mechanisms, but fewer studies have
   examined this possibility. We manipulated brood size in zebra finches to
   simultaneously examine the effects of developmental stress on male song
   learning and female behavioral and neural response to song. Although
   adult male HVC volume was unaffected, we found that males from larger
   broods imitated tutor song less accurately. In females, early condition
   did not affect the direction of song preference: all females preferred
   tutor song over unfamiliar song in an operant test. However, treatment
   did affect the magnitude of behavioral response to song: females from
   larger broods responded less during song preference trials. This
   difference in activity level did not reflect boldness per se, as a
   separate measure of this trait did not differ with brood size.
   Additionally, in females we found a treatment effect on expression of
   the immediate early gene ZENK in response to tutor song in brain regions
   involved in song perception (dNCM) and social motivation (LSc.vl, BSTm,
   TnA), but not in a region implicated in song memory (CMM). These results
   are consistent with the hypothesis that developmental stressors that
   impair song learning in male zebra finches also influence perceptual
   and/or motivational processes in females. However, our results suggest
   that the learning of tutor song by females is robust to disturbance by
   developmental stress. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{144-148}},
Month = {{AUG-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cannibalism has been observed occasionally in a limited number of
   different animal species, but the underlying mechanisms that foster this
   behavior are mostly unknown. Here we show that mosquito (Culex pipiens)
   larvae show this behavior towards conspecifics under certain conditions.
   Cannibalism was only observed in 4th instar larvae and only in response
   to starvation. Well fed animals never showed any cannibalistic behavior.
   Starvation induced cannibalism of Culex 4th instar was predominantly
   directed towards 3rd instars rather than to 1st or 2nd instar larvae.
   Specific mandibular structures of these larvae enable this cannibalistic
   behavior. We could show that treatment with the biogenic amine
   octopamine, which is known to be involved in the control of starvation
   and aggression, increased the rate of cannibalism of food-deprived 4th
   instar larvae significantly. Incubation with the octopamine receptor
   antagonist phentolamine suppressed this cannibalistic behavior.
   Moreover, octopamine not only increased the rate of cannibalism, it also
   induced a shift towards smaller prey. A role of octopamine in this
   starvation induced behavior was further supported by direct measurements
   of the total content of this important neuroactive compound. Taken
   together, we could show that 4th instar mosquito larvae showed
   cannibalistic behavior after starvation and that this behavior
   apparently depends on octopamine.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Climate-driven increases in spring temperatures are expected to result
   in higher prey availability earlier in the breeding season for
   insectivorous birds breeding in wetland habitats. Predation during the
   incubation phase is a major cause of nesting failure in open-nesting
   altricial birds such as the Eurasian reed warbler. The nest predation
   rate in this species has recently been shown to be substantially reduced
   under conditions of experimentally elevated invertebrate prey
   availability. Food availability near the nest may be an important
   determinant of adult incubation and nest defence behaviours during the
   incubation period. We used two experimental studies to compare
   incubation behaviour and nest defence in food-supplemented and
   unsupplemented adult Eurasian reed warblers during the incubation phase.
   In the first study we measured nest defence behavioural responses to a
   taxidermic mount of a native predator (stoat Mustela erminea). In the
   second study we used temperature loggers installed in nests to measure
   breaks in incubation as a measure of nest vulnerability.
   Food-supplemented birds responded aggressively to the presence of a
   predator more quickly than those in the unsupplemented group, suggesting
   they are closer to their nest and can more quickly detect a predator in
   the vicinity. Food-supplemented birds also had shorter breaks in
   incubation (both in terms of maximum and mean off-bout durations),
   presumably because they were foraging for shorter periods or over
   shorter distances from the nest. This study therefore identifies the
   behavioural mechanisms by which changes in food availability may lead to
   changes in nest survival and thus breeding productivity, in open-nesting
   insectivorous birds.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most studies on food choice have been focussing on the
   individual level but familial aspects may also play an important role.
   This paper reports of a novel study that will focus on the familial
   aspects of the formation of food choice among men and women aged 50-70
   years by recruiting spouses and siblings (NutriAct Family Study; NFS).
   Methods: Data is collected prospectively via repeatedly applied
   web-based questionnaires over the next years. The recruitment for the
   NFS started in October 2016. Participants are recruited based on an
   index person who is actively participating in the European Prospective
   Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study. This index
   person was asked to invite the spouse, a sibling or an in-law. If a set
   of family members agreed to participate, access to individualized
   web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, other health related
   lifestyle habits, eating behaviour, food responsiveness, personality,
   self-regulation, socio-economic status and socio-cultural values was
   provided. In the first phase of the NSF, recruitment rates were
   monitored in detail and participants' comments were analysed in order to
   improve the feasibility of procedures and instruments.
   Discussion: Until August 4th 2017, 4783 EPIC-Participants were contacted
   by mail of which 446 persons recruited 2 to 5 family members (including
   themselves) resulting in 1032 participants, of whom 82\% had started
   answering or already completed the questionnaires. Of the 4337 remaining
   EPIC-participants who had been contacted, 1040 (24\%) did not respond at
   all, and 3297 (76\%) responded but declined, in 51\% of the cases
   because of the request to recruit at least 2 family members in the
   respective age range. The developed recruitment procedures and web-based
   methods of data collection are capable to generate the required study
   population including the data on individual and inter-personal
   determinants which will be linkable to food choice. The information on
   familial links among the study participants will show the role of
   familial traits in midlife for the adoption of food choices supporting
   healthy aging.}},

Abstract = {{The potential impact of carabid predation on dispersing Bombina
   variegala metamorphs was studied in the field at the Schmidtenhohe
   (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) and performing experimental trials in
   the laboratory. At least four carabid species were demonstrated to feed
   on metamorphs, with Carabus violaceus and Pterostichus niger mainly
   preying on the smallest individuals, and Abax parallelepipedus and
   Harpalus rufipes indiscriminately attacking smaller and larger
   individuals. Predation rates were mostly low (5-15\% of metamorphs)
   despite of high prey densities (8(3) metamorphs per m(2)), but hungry
   beetles consumed up to 60\% within five days. Plasticity in the timing
   of metamorphosis (about two months) and in the size at metamorphosis
   (11-19 mm) observed in the field seemed to reflect mainly the
   variability in the spawning date and of aquatic environment during the
   tadpole development. Still, the tendency of metamorphs to be become
   larger on average towards the end of the metamorphosis period reduced
   their risk of being predated because the abundance of potential carabid
   predators did neither vary among habitat types crossed by dispersing
   metamorphs nor during the period of metamorphosis. Consequently,
   informed conservation management of endangered B. variegata populations
   should focus on larval habitats producing large-sized metamorphs to
   reduce loss of metamorphs by size-assortative carabid predation.}},

   in nearshore shallow coastal waters. In two consecutive experimental
   trials, oysters (n = 4) wired with Hall Effect biosensors (that measured
   valve gaping at one-second intervals) were exposed for 10 days at six
   different pCO(2) treatments spanning a range currently observed in
   nearshore coastal regions, and predicted under near-future ocean
   acidification. After the 10-day acclimation period, oysters from each
   pCO(2) treatment were exposed to a 3-h heat shock assay (11-12 -> 30
   degrees C) and valve gaping activity was monitored continuously. During
   the heat shock assays, valve gaping activity increased with increasing
   temperature and then ceased when temperature was reduced back to 11-12
   degrees C; however, these valve gaping rate increases during heat shock
   were not characteristic of overly-stressed oysters. Exposure to elevated
   pCO(2) had no effect on the valve gaping response of oysters to acute
   heat shock. Our results suggest that the valve gaping responses of adult
   eastern oysters to acute temperature increases are unaffected by
   short-term elevations in seawater pCO(2). Future studies incorporating
   the roles of local adaptation, food availability, and direct functional

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{750-769}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Chemicals released into the environment by food, predators and
   conspecifics play critical roles in Drosophila reproduction. Females and
   males live in an environment full of smells, whose molecules communicate
   to them the availability of food, potential mates, competitors or
   predators. Volatile chemicals derived from fruit, yeast growing on the
   fruit, and flies already present on the fruit attract Drosophila,
   concentrating flies at food sites, where they will also mate.
   Species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons displayed on female Drosophila
   as they mature are sensed by males and act as pheromones to stimulate
   mating by conspecific males and inhibit heterospecific mating. The
   pheromonal profile of a female is also responsive to her nutritional
   environment, providing an honest signal of her fertility potential.
   After mating, cuticular and semen hydrocarbons transferred by the male
   change the female's chemical profile. These molecules make the female
   less attractive to other males, thus protecting her mate's sperm
   investment. Females have evolved the capacity to counteract this
   inhibition by ejecting the semen hydrocarbon (along with the rest of the
   remaining ejaculate) a few hours after mating. Although this ejection
   can temporarily restore the female's attractiveness, shortly thereafter
   another male pheromone, a seminal peptide, decreases the female's
   propensity to re-mate, thus continuing to protect the male's investment.
   Females use olfaction and taste sensing to select optimal egg-laying
   sites, integrating cues for the availability of food for her offspring,
   and the presence of other flies and of harmful species. We argue that
   taking into account evolutionary considerations such as sexual conflict,
   and the ecological conditions in which flies live, is helpful in
   understanding the role of highly species-specific pheromones and blends
   thereof, as well as an individual's response to the chemical cues in its
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple diversification rate shifts explain uneven clade richness in

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits overlap in behavioral syndromes that are assumed to
   be related to physiology and life history traits, shaping pace-of-life
   syndromes. Boldness and explorative behavior are frequently associated
   with higher parasite loads, increased resource acquisition, less
   efficient antipredator behavior, and reduced survival (e.g., through
   predation). We explored how personality is related to these biological
   traits using an invasive species-Atlantoxerus getulus in Fuerteventura
   island-as a model system with reduced parasitism and low predation
   pressure. We used breath rate during handling, open field tests, and
   escape trials to test for the existence of interindividual differences
   in boldness, explorative behavior, and escape speed, respectively. We
   also tested whether the personality traits were related and formed
   behavioral syndromes in A. getulus. At the same time, we explored how
   personality is related to ectoparasite load, body condition, and
   survival in the species. We found strong between-individual differences
   in breath rate, readiness to get in the open field arena, and escape
   speed. We found a behavioral syndrome, linking open field entrance and
   escape speed, in A. getulus. However, personality was not related to
   parasite load or body condition and survival was higher for bolder
   individuals. As a whole, our results suggest reduced parasites and
   predator pressures on Fuerteventura may have potentially neutralized the
   typical drawbacks of a fast pace-of-life in the introduced population of
   A. getulus.
   Significance statement
   Research on the interactions of animal personality with other ecological
   and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and selection gradients,
   has yielded some intriguing perspectives about many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of the
   eco-evolutionary consequences of animal personality and how it interacts
   with other relevant biological processes is still limited. Invasive
   species often experience specific ecological conditions that can allow
   testing of the general assumptions related to animal personality. The
   present contribution explores if and how personality traits are related
   to key ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and
   survival, in the context of an invasive population subjected to reduced
   parasite and predation pressure. Unlike other studies conducted under
   different ecological contexts, our results suggest Barbary ground
   squirrels from the assessed population with fast pace-of-life syndromes
   have higher survival chances than their counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Small birds overwintering in cold climates must meet the daily challenge
   of accumulating sufficient energy reserves throughout the day to ensure
   overnight survival. Theoretical work suggests that risk of starvation is
   a major force shaping optimal daily foraging routines. Animals are
   predicted to adjust how they distribute their daily foraging activity in
   relation to environmental harshness, which largely determines the risk
   of starvation. Here, we used radiofrequency identification
   (RFID)-enabled bird feeders to test whether mountain chickadees, Poecile
   gambeli - small, resident, food-caching birds - exhibited different
   daily foraging routines in harsher (higher elevation) versus milder
   (lower elevation) environments in the Sierra Nevada. In addition, we
   assessed foraging routines between four different periods of the
   nonbreeding season ranging from autumn (milder conditions) to winter and
   early spring (harsher conditions) and to late spring (milder
   conditions). We also tested whether individual variation in spatial
   cognition associated with food caching, which represents a more reliable
   food source that can be expected to lower risk of starvation, is
   associated with differences in daily foraging routines. Chickadees from
   both elevations distributed their daily foraging efforts differently
   throughout the nonbreeding season, consistent with theoretical
   predictions for milder and harsher conditions. Differences between
   chickadees from high and low elevations were especially pronounced
   during harsher winter periods, with chickadees from high elevations
   showing a bimodal daily routine, while low-elevation birds showed an
   inverted U-shaped daily routine, with most foraging during the middle of
   the day. Finally, significant differences in daily routines were
   associated with variation in spatial learning and memory performance.
   Overall, our study shows that daily foraging routines are consistent
   with risk of starvation under different degrees of environmental
   harshness, whether across nonbreeding seasons or between elevations, and
   that perception of harshness may be associated with cognitive abilities.

Abstract = {{Previous studies in animal models and humans have shown that exposure to
   nutritional deficiencies in the perinatal period increases the risk of
   psychiatric disease. Less well understood is how such effects are
   modulated by the combination of genetic background and parent-of-origin
   (PO). To explore this, we exposed female mice from 20 Collaborative
   Cross (CC) strains to protein deficient, vitamin D deficient, methyl
   donor enriched or standard diet during the perinatal period. These CC
   females were then crossed to a male from a different CC strain to
   produce reciprocal F1 hybrid females comprising 10 distinct genetic
   backgrounds. The adult F1 females were then tested in the open field,
   light/dark, stress-induced hyperthermia, forced swim and restraint
   stress assays. Our experimental design allowed us to estimate effects of
   genetic background, perinatal diet, PO and their interactions on
   behavior. Genetic background significantly affected all assessed
   phenotypes. Perinatal diet exposure interacted with genetic background
   to affect body weight, basal body temperature, anxiety-like behavior and
   stress response. In 8 of 9 genetic backgrounds, PO effects were observed
   on multiple phenotypes. Additionally, we identified a small number of
   diet-by-PO effects on body weight, stress response, anxiety- and
   depressive-like behavior. Our data show that rodent behaviors that model
   psychiatric disorders are affected by genetic background, PO and
   perinatal diet, as well as interactions among these factors.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic approaches to human health have received growing attention in
   the past two decades. They allow to view the development of human
   organisms as plastic, i.e. as open to influences from the social and
   material environment such as nutrition, stress, and trauma. This has
   lent new credence to approaches in biomedicine that aim to draw
   attention to the importance of development for later life health. Some
   scholars in the social sciences and humanities have welcomed such
   approaches as a departure from genecentric perspectives and as an
   opportunity for highlighting the social and political determinants of
   health and illness. Others have warned that they might lead to new forms
   of biological reductionisms and determinisms. In this article, we
   explore how research on developmental plasticity addresses and
   articulates global health disparities, specifically in the context of
   postcolonial India. We discuss two prominent approaches from the field
   of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) that build on
   epigenetic perspectives on health and illness and view different global
   rates of disease susceptibility as the result of developmental
   processes: first, the `mismatch paradigm' by Peter Gluckman and Mark
   Hanson and second, the `metabolic ghetto' concept by Jonathan Wells. We
   highlight how both approaches render historical and social factors
   meaningful for the development of global health disparities, but
   emphasize how they at the same time remain prone to determinisms and
   reductionisms reminiscent of a gene-centric perspective. DOHaD actors
   themselves are critical of these tendencies, and in conclusion we
   explore novel opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations enabled
   by this critical potential.}},

   hydroponic culture (HC), solid nutrient free (in terms of plant
   nutrients; vermiculite and perlite mixture; VPC) culture and soil
   culture (SC). We observed that both nitrate starvation and root growth
   media modulate overall root system architecture. However, the ability of
   such modulation is genotype specific. Further, the solid nutrient free
   media, in contrast to solution culture (HC), induced much pronounced
   effect on overall architecture indicating their nitrate foraging ability

   more exploratory root morphology in nitrate deficient condition. In
   general the effect of nitrate stress is more predominant in VPC followed

   most responsive towards nitrogen starvation condition and root growth

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{445-452}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
   several genes associated with obesity. The mechanisms through which
   these genes affect body weight are not fully characterized. Recent
   studies suggest that eating behavior (EB) traits could be involved, but
   only a few EB traits were investigated.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether genetic
   susceptibility to obesity is mediated by EB traits (cognitive restraint,
   disinhibition, hunger) and their subscales. We hypothesized that EB
   traits, and their subscales, partly mediate this association.
   Design: Adult individuals (n = 768) who participated in the Quebec
   Family Study were included in this cross-sectional study. A genetic risk
   score (GRS) of obesity was calculated based on the 97 genetic variants
   recently identified in a GWAS meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI). EB
   traits and their subscales were assessed with the use of the
   Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Regression analyses with age and sex
   as covariates were used to investigate the associations between GRS, EB
   traits, BMI, and WC and whether the association between GRS and obesity
   is mediated by EB traits, which represents the indirect effect of GRS on
   obesity.
   Results: The GRS of obesity was positively associated with BMI (beta =
   0.19 +/- 0.04, P < 0.0001) and WC (beta = 0.46 +/- 0.10, P < 0.0001).
   Regression analyses also revealed that the association between GRS of
   obesity and BMI was partly mediated by disinhibition and susceptibility
   to hunger (beta(indirect) = 0.09 +/- 0.03, P = 0.0007, and
   beta(indirect) = 0.04 +/- 0.02, P = 0.02, respectively). Habitual and
   situational susceptibility to disinhibition (beta(indirect) = 0.08 +/-
   0.03, P = 0.002 and beta(indirect) = 0.05 +/- 0.02, P = 0.003,
   respectively) as well as internal and external locus of hunger
   (beta(indirect) = 0.03 +/- 0.02, P = 0.03 for both) were also found to
   mediate the association between GRS of obesity and BMI. The same trends
   were observed with WC.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the genetic
   susceptibility to obesity is partly mediated through undesirable EB
   traits, which suggests that they could be targeted in obesity treatment
   and prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Individual vigilance against threats typically decreases with group
   size. However, group size often explains a small amount of variation in
   vigilance, suggesting that other factors such as individual differences
   might contribute. For instance, individuals could maintain different
   vigilance levels overall and also respond differently to variation in
   group size. We investigated individual variation in vigilance and its
   patterns of plasticity in flocks of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus
   (Linnaeus, 1758)). We carried out observations at one provisioned site
   and used multiple observations of the same individuals (n = 14) in
   flocks of different sizes over two consecutive months. The typical
   decline in vigilance with flock size occurred at the population level.
   Controlling for food density, flock size, time of year, and sex, we
   documented consistent individual differences in various measurements of
   vigilance. Plasticity of vigilance adjustments to variation in flock
   size occurred for the frequency of high vigilance postures. Male House
   Sparrows with larger bibs, which signal higher dominance status, tended
   to spend less time vigilant and obtained food at a higher rate,
   supporting a state-dependent explanation for the origin of individual
   vigilance profiles. Individual differences can contribute to explaining
   the large scatter in the relationship between vigilance and group size
   in many species.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is regarded as one of the major concerns of the 21st
   Century, with mean temperatures expected to increase by about 3 degrees
   C over the next 100 years. Species responses to climate change are not
   consistent, with some species apparently able to respond more quickly
   than others, thus producing changes in community structure. One
   increasingly common observation is that species at lower trophic levels
   respond more quickly to change in climate than species at higher levels.
   This can result in, for example, the timing of a predator's peak food
   requirements being separated in time from the point at which their prey
   is most available. It has been suggested that this creates an additional
   risk for the persistence of species at high trophic levels as the
   climate alters; there is an alternative possibility - that predators may
   change their diets in response to changing prey availability. Models of
   diet choice make several predictions, for example they suggest that
   whether a predator includes a secondary prey into its diet depends on
   the availability of the primary prey and not on characteristics of the
   secondary prey. By switching between one prey type and another, a
   predator population may be able to persist in a particular location
   longer than they would otherwise. Using a simple demonstration model we
   show that this idea is theoretically plausible.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{8894-8907}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{When prey are differentially affected by intra and interspecific
   competition, the cooccurrence of multiple prey species alters the per
   capita availability of food for a particular prey species which could
   alter how prey respond to the threat of predation, and hence the
   overall-effect of predators. We conducted an experiment to examine the
   extent to which the nonconsumptive and overall effect of predatory water
   bugs on snail and tadpole traits (performance and morphology) depended
   on whether tadpoles and snails cooccurred. Tadpoles and snails differed
   in their relative susceptibility to intraspecific and interspecific
   competition, and predators affected both prey species via consumptive
   and nonconsumptive mechanisms. Furthermore, the overall effect of
   predators often depended on whether another prey species was present.
   The reasoning for why the overall effect of predators depended on
   whether prey species cooccurred, however, differed for each of the
   response variables. Predators affected snail body growth via
   nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the change in the overall effect of
   predators on snail body growth was attributable to how snails responded
   to competition in the absence of predators, rather than a change in how
   snails responded to the threat of predation. Predators did not affect
   tadpole body growth via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the greater
   vulnerability of competitively superior prey (snails) to predators
   increased the strength of consumptive mechanisms (and hence the overall
   effect) through which predators affected tadpole growth. Predators
   affected tadpole morphology via nonconsumptive mechanisms, but the
   greater propensity for predators to kill competitively superior prey
   (snails) enhanced the ability of tadpoles to alter their morphology in
   response to the threat of predation by creating an environment where
   tadpoles had a higher per capita supply of food available to invest in
   the development of morphological defenses. Our work indicates that the
   mechanisms through which predators affect prey depends on the other
   members of the community.}},

   White-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) persist in both urban

   Using the Program MARK, we tested the effects of habitat (urban/rural)

   We predicted that survival and body condition would be lower in urban
   habitats and decrease with increasing background noise level on
   territories. We found that survival estimates vary according to year,

   predict body condition, such that soundscape negatively correlates with

   to stress. Dams were fed either a low protein diet (10\% protein by
   weight) or isocaloric control diet (20\% protein by weight). The low

   5 HT1A receptor function, as measured by quantitative autoradiography of

Abstract = {{Background: Economically disadvantaged families receive care in both
   clinical and community settings, but this care is rarely coordinated and
   can result in conflicting educational messaging. WEE Baby Care is a
   pragmatic randomized clinical trial evaluating a patient-centered
   responsive parenting (RP) intervention that uses health information
   technology (HIT) strategies to coordinate care between pediatric primary
   care providers (PCPs) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
   Women, Infant and Children (WIC) community nutritionists to prevent
   rapid weight gain from birth to 6 months. It is hypothesized that data
   integration and coordination will improve consistency in RP messaging
   and parent self-efficacy, promoting shared decision making and infant
   self-regulation, to reduce infant rapid weight gain from birth to 6
   months.
   Methods/design: Two hundred and ninety mothers and their full-term
   newborns will be recruited and randomized to the ``RP intervention{''}
   or ``standard care control{''} groups. The RP intervention includes: 1)
   parenting and nutrition education developed using the American Academy
   of Pediatrics Healthy Active Living for Families curriculum in
   conjunction with portions of a previously tested RP curriculum delivered
   by trained pediatric PCPs and WIC nutritionists during regularly
   scheduled appointments; 2) parent-reported data using the Early Healthy
   Lifestyles (EHL) risk assessment tool; and 3) data integration into
   child's electronic health records with display and documentation
   features to inform counseling and coordinate care between pediatric PCPs
   and WIC nutritionists. The primary study outcome is rapid infant weight
   gain from birth to 6 months derived from sex-specific World Health
   Organization adjusted weight-for-age z-scores. Additional outcomes
   include care coordination, messaging consistency, parenting behaviors
   (e.g., food to soothe), self-efficacy, and infant sleep health. Infant
   temperament and parent depression will be explored as moderators of RP
   effects on infant outcomes.
   Discussion: This pragmatic patient-centered RP intervention integrates
   and coordinates care across clinical and community sectors, potentially
   offering a fundamental change in the delivery of pediatric care for
   prevention and health promotion. Findings from this trial can inform
   large scale dissemination of obesity prevention programs.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, better known as O-GlcNAc, is a sugar
   post-translational modification participating in a diverse range of cell
   functions. Disruptions in the cycling of O-GlcNAc mediated by O-GlcNAc
   transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively, is a driving
   force for aberrant cell signaling in disease pathologies, such as
   diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Production of
   UDP-GlcNAc, the metabolic substrate for OGT, by the Hexosamine
   Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) is controlled by the input of amino acids,
   fats, and nucleic acids, making O-GlcNAc a key nutrient-sensor for
   fluctuations in these macromolecules. The mammalian target of rapamycin
   (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways also participate
   in nutrient-sensing as a means of controlling cell activity and are
   significant factors in a variety of pathologies. Research into the
   individual nutrient-sensitivities of the HBP, AMPK, and mTOR pathways
   has revealed a complex regulatory dynamic, where their unique responses
   to macromolecule levels coordinate cell behavior. Importantly,
   cross-talk between these pathways fine-tunes the cellular response to
   nutrients. Strong evidence demonstrates that AMPK negatively regulates
   the mTOR pathway, but O-GlcNAcylation of AMPK lowers enzymatic activity
   and promotes growth. On the other hand, AMPK can phosphorylate OGT
   leading to changes in OGT function. Complex sets of interactions between
   the HBP, AMPK, and mTOR pathways integrate nutritional signals to
   respond to changes in the environment. In particular, examining these
   relationships using systems biology approaches might prove a useful
   method of exploring the complex nature of cell signaling. Overall,
   understanding the complex interactions of these nutrient pathways will
   provide novel mechanistic information into how nutrients influence
   health and disease.}},

   approach to food-and weight-related concerns has been weight-loss
   through dietary restriction, these interventions have produced little
   long-term benefit, and may be counterproductive. A growing understanding
   of the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underpin habit
   formation may explain why this approach has largely failed, and pave the
   way for a new generation of non-pharmacologic interventions. Here, we
   first review how modern food environments interact with human biology to
   promote reward-related eating through associative learning, i.e.,
   operant conditioning. We also review how operant conditioning (positive
   and negative reinforcement) cultivates habit-based reward-related
   eating, and how current diet paradigms may not directly target such
   eating. Further, we describe how mindfulness training that targets
   reward-based learning may constitute an appropriate intervention to
   rewire the learning process around eating. We conclude with examples
   that illustrate how teaching patients to tap into and act on intrinsic
   (e.g., enjoying healthy eating, not overeating, and self-compassion)
   rather than extrinsic reward mechanisms (e.g., weighing oneself), is a
   promising new direction in improving individuals' relationship with
   food.}},

Abstract = {{The etiopathogenesis of depression may involve repeated exposure to
   several unpredictable stressors. This study was conducted to investigate
   changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and to
   assess behavioral and neurochemical changes that predict depressive-like
   behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Male Drosophila melanogaster flies
   were exposed to CUMS with several stressors (cold, heat, starvation, and
   sleep deprivation) in an unpredictable and chronic manner for ten days.
   At the end of treatment, in vivo behavioral tests (open field,
   aggression, forced swimming, mating, light/dark box, male fertility
   evaluation, sucrose preference, weight evaluation) and ex vivo analyses
   (dopamine and serotonin levels) were performed. Using this CUMS model,
   we obtained results that contribute to the construction of a depressive
   model in Drosophila, where we reproduce some behavioral phenotypes
   corresponding to depressive symptoms, such as immobility in the forced
   swimming test, less exploration in the light/dark test, changes in
   mating behavior, changes in the aggressiveness test, reduced sucrose
   preference, and weight-loss, in addition to a significant reduction in
   the levels of serotonin and dopamine when compared to the control group.
   Fluoxetine was used in our study as a positive control to demonstrate
   that CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in flies can be reversed by
   antidepressants. In conclusion, male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to
   CUMS display a depressive-like phenotype, and, while this poses some
   limitations as an animal model for depression, it meets some of the
   criteria required to be a valid model, such as good face and construct
   validity.}},

Abstract = {{The pseudoscorpion Paratemnoides nidificator is a generalist predator
   that captures large arthropods that live on tree trunks. Few
   pseudoscorpions species show some degree of sociality. We investigated
   how colonies of the pseudoscorpion P. nidificator adjust their
   cooperative capture behavior under a situation of changing prey types as
   a simulation of variation in prey availability. We hypothesized that
   colonies would be more efficient at prey capture under repeated exposure
   to the same prey, and that the change in the availability of prey would
   be followed by new behavioral adjustments to adequately exploit the new
   prey. Eight experimental colonies housed in the laboratory received
   repetitions of three different ant species as prey. The number of
   pseudoscorpions attacking the prey, the number of behavioral acts, and
   the time expended subduing prey were evaluated as measures of prey
   capture performance, in relation to repetitive exposure to the same prey
   and also in relation to prey type changes. However, only individuals'
   recruitment significantly responded to prey type exposure. Prey capture
   behavior was heterogeneous among colonies, resulting in highly variable
   behavioral responses. Colonies showed a tendency toward increasing
   capture success through repeated prey type exposure. However, 50\% of
   the colonies were unable to capture the new prey type and died of
   starvation. Although it is a generalist predator, prey capture behavior
   could depend on different coordination components for subduing and
   handling large prey. Therefore, changes in prey availability could cause
   the attenuation of a cooperative relationship in some colonies, making
   them more prone to failure during capture.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hoarding behaviour (storing food for a later use) has evolved to reduce
   starvation risk when resources are scarce. Different age and sex classes
   often show differences in foraging due to experience, skills or life
   history strategy, but such differences in hoarding under
   spatio-temporally varying environmental conditions have rarely been
   studied in the wild. We studied hoarding behaviour of Eurasian pygmy
   owls (Glaucidium passerinum) during 2003-2016 in western Finland, where
   the abundance of their main prey (voles) fluctuates in three-year
   population cycles. In 14years, 1056 food stores were found during the
   hoarding season (Oct-Dec) and 330 pygmy owls were trapped at these
   stores. The number of stores per individual did not vary in relation to
   age, sex or vole abundance. Adults (+1-year old) had their stores
   farther apart than yearlings. Both the number of stores per year and the
   biomass of stored prey items increased with vole abundance. Females and
   yearlings had larger and heavier stores than males and adults,
   respectively. The same individuals stored more food as yearlings than as
   adults. These sex- and age-differences in hoarding indicate that it is
   not constrained by experience or skills. It rather seems that
   less-experienced yearlings rely more on stored food than adults. Females
   may need more food due to their larger size and need to accumulate
   energy reserves before reproduction. A detailed knowledge of age- and
   sex-related differences in hoarding behaviour under fluctuating
   abundances of main foods is fundamental to better understand a
   population response to climate change and forest management.Significance
   statementThe hoarding behaviour of animals has evolved to cope with the
   problem of food limitation. On the basis of 14-year data from pygmy
   owls, we show that the number of stores per year and the biomass of prey
   items per store increased with vole abundance in the environment. Adults
   had stores farther apart than yearlings, and females and yearlings
   stored more prey items and biomass compared to males and adults,
   respectively. These results indicate that hoarding behaviour responds to
   the available main prey abundance and varies with traits such as age and
   sex. Because different age and sex classes might respond differently to
   variation in food abundance, due to habitat alterations or climate
   change, a detailed knowledge of hoarding behaviour can be of particular
   importance to understand changes in body condition, reproductive success
   and survival of pygmy owls under changing climate and management of
   boreal forest.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Predation by the crown-of-thorns seastar (CoTS; Acanthaster sp.) is a
   pervasive stressor attributing to the decline of coral reefs. These
   outbreaks are suggested to be linked to eutrophy-driven recruitment
   pulses, where increased nutrients enhance larval success. CoTS larvae,
   however, are tolerant of oligotrophic conditions typical of tropical
   ecosystems and outbreaks occur in regions isolated from eutrophy,
   highlighting the resilience of these larvae to oligotrophic conditions.
   Here, we test the hypothesis that CoTS larvae associate with bacterial
   communities that are dynamic across an oligotrophic-eutrophic continuum
   and are specific to each feeding regime. Our analysis of the CoTS larval
   microbiome suggests that CoTS larvae associate with a bacterial
   community distinct from the environmental microbiota and that this
   community experiences a community-level shift in response to
   differential feeding that is maintained over development. Symbioses with
   a diverse and dynamic, and a potentially phototrophic, bacterial
   community may contribute to resilience of CoTS larvae that enable the
   success of CoTS and, perhaps, other tropical marine larvae in
   oligotrophic seas.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{136-143}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ability to identify familiar foods is a major driver of animal feeding
   behavior Animals show preference for familiar foods over novel ones,
   presumably to avoid poisonous substances and better support their growth
   and reproduction. However, we do not know how their feeding behavior is
   affected when the familiar food is inferior to a novel food with regards
   to its palatability and nutritional properties. We tested the hypothesis
   that feeding preference is determined by specific food characteristics
   rather than food familiarity with fast-growing soil dwelling nematodes.
   Two sequential experiments were designed to test the feeding behavior of
   soil bacterial feeding nematodes (Mesorhabditis sp. and Acrobeloides
   sp.) resulting from familiar food recognition, including a 6-months
   training period to develop their food familiarity and a feeding
   experiment to test their food preference for five bacterial species.
   Nematodes showed clear preference for specific food sources, which were
   not necessarily the familiar food. Their feeding behavior was not
   affected by food familiarity, but correlated highly with bacterial
   traits such as cell size, growth rates, and water content. We conclude
   that nematode feeding behavior was controlled by food specificity rather
   than familiarity. We further suggest that physiological factors,
   possibly the physical size and presence of chemical receptors in the
   buccal cavity, allow nematodes to rapidly assess their food supply and
   switch from a familiar food to a preferred, novel food that is easier to
   ingest and better suited to support their growth and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor-based technologies are becoming increasingly available and can be
   used to automatically gather long-term data about animal behaviour. With
   this information, it is possible to assess the circadian rhythm of
   activity and monitor its response to internal and external factors.
   Identifying irregularities in this rhythm may indicate animal health and
   welfare issues. The aim of this study was to collect sensor-based
   general activity and investigate circadian rhythm of this activity to
   identify the changes due to weather influences that act on these
   parameters throughout the year; to identify the differences between
   individuals; and to assess links between general activity and circadian
   rhythm of activity with sheep body weight change. In total, 29 Scottish
   Blackface ewes of different ages and body condition scores were used.
   The animals were monitored for four consecutive weeks in each of four
   seasonal periods, in extensive systems on Scottish upland pastures, and
   without human handling during study periods. Accelerometer-integrated
   collars were fitted to the animals to collect motion index continuously
   every minute. These data were used to calculate the percentage of cyclic
   behaviour that was harmonic/synchronized with the environment (over 24 h
   period), as Degree of Functional Coupling (DFC). The DFC was shown
   within rolling seven-day periods. Low DFCs indicate low synchronization.
   Weather data were collected daily. Random regression models were used to
   assess between-individual variation. During the winter period, the level
   of the DFC for the activity of nineteen ewes lowered in response to a
   period of high level of precipitation combined with low winter
   temperatures. However, four ewes exhibited a lower level of variation in
   the DFC values, showing that there were differences between individuals
   in regard to their response to the precipitation level. The overall mean
   of the DFC for the general activity was highest in autumn (95.4\%, P <
   0.001), however, it did not differ between summer and spring
   (respectively 90.2\% and 88.1\%, P > 0.05), but was significantly lower
   during the winter (81.7\%, P < 0.001) compared with summer and autumn.
   Over the spring and summer, variation in DFC was a good estimator of
   body weight gain. It was concluded that the assessment of circadian
   rhythms of general activity using the DFC-parameter allows a better
   understanding of sheep responses to weather influences, compared to the
   evaluation of general activity alone. The random regression model method
   was effective in identifying animals that deviated positively or
   negatively from population responses.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural flexibility, the ability to adjust behaviour to
   environmental change by adapting existing skills to novel situations, is
   key to coping with, for example, complex social interactions, seasonal
   changes in food availability or detecting predators. We tested the tree
   skink, Egernia striolata, a family-living skink from eastern Australia,
   in a set-shifting paradigm of eight colour/shape discriminations
   including reversals, an intradimensional acquisition of a new
   colour/shape and extradimensional shift from colour to shape (and vice
   versa). Skinks could learn to discriminate between colour/shape pairs
   and reverse this initial stimuluse-reward association; however, they
   showed no significant decrease in the probability of making a correct
   choice in the extradimensional shift suggesting that they did not form
   an attentional set. Subjects appear to have learnt each stage as a new
   problem instead of generalizing stimuli into specific dimensions (set
   formation). In conclusion, tree skinks solved a discrimination reversal
   by focusing their attention towards visual stimuli and flexibly
   adjusting their choice behaviour accordingly. These lizards learned to
   use multidimensional visual stimuli to find a food reward but did not
   generalize stimuli into dimensions. Furthermore, this study is the first
   to test for set shifting in a lizard species and thereby allows us to
   extend set-shifting theory to a new taxon for comparison with primates,

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a common agricultural practice, which, by
   increasing the quality of plants, also enhances their nutritional
   suitability for insect herbivores, creating the possibility of a cascade
   of N across trophic levels, from plant to herbivore to predator. We
   manipulated the quality of cucumber plants by fertilizing them with
   three different N rates (110, 160, and 210 ppm), which represented low,
   medium, and high N levels, respectively. Colonies of Aphis gossypii
   Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were then reared on these plants and used
   as prey for adult Hippodamia variegate (Goeze) (Coleoptera:
   Coccinellidae) in experiments that characterized the predator's foraging
   behavior and functional response to different aphid densities. The
   nutritional content of plants and aphids was also measured. As N
   fertilization increased, so did the nutrient content (total energy) of
   aphids and this resulted in declining rates of aphid consumption by
   beetles at higher aphid densities. Females in the 110 N treatment, and
   males in all treatments, responded to aphids with a type II functional
   response (decelerating consumption at higher densities), but females in
   the 160 and 210 ppm N treatments exhibited a type III response
   (consuming a declining proportion of available aphids at high
   densities). Beetles fed aphids from the 110 N treatment consumed more
   prey in both assays than did those fed aphids from the 210 N treatment.
   Beetle searching time, handling time, and duration of digestive pauses
   all increased at high levels of N fertilization, especially for
   females.The results indicate that heavy N fertilization can increase
   prey nutritional quality to the point where it alters predator foraging
   and feeding behavior, resulting in slower rates of prey consumption and
   longer prey handling times.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive disturbances often predate characteristic motor dysfunction in
   individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) and place an increasing
   burden on the HD patients and caregivers with the progression of the
   disorder. Therefore, application of maximally translational cognitive
   tests to animal models of HD is imperative for the development of
   treatments that could alleviate cognitive decline in human patients.
   Here, we examined the performance of the Q175 mouse knock-in model of HD
   in the touch screen version of the paired associates learning (PAL)
   task. We found that 10-11-month-old heterozygous Q175 mice had severely
   attenuated learning curve in the PAL task, which was conceptually
   similar to previously documented impaired performance of individuals
   with HD in the PAL task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
   Automated Battery (CANTAB). Besides high rate of errors in PAL task,
   Q175 mice exhibited considerably lower responding rate than age-matched
   wild-type (WT) animals. Our examination of effortful operant responding
   during fixed ratio (FR) and progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement
   schedules in a separate cohort of similar age confirmed slower and
   unselective performance of mutant animals, as observed during PAL task,
   but suggested that motivation to work for nutritional reward in the
   touch screen setting was similar in Q175 and WT mice. We also
   demonstrated that pronounced sensorimotor disturbances in Q175 mice can
   be detected at early touch screen testing stages, (e.g., during ``Punish
   Incorrect{''} phase of operant pretraining), so we propose that shorter
   test routines may be utilised for more expedient studies of treatments
   aimed at the rescue of HD-related phenotype.}},

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMediterranean diet (MD) interventions are demonstrated to
   significantly reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but are typically
   resource intensive and delivered by health professionals. There is
   considerable interest to develop interventions that target sustained
   dietary behaviour change and that are feasible to scale-up for wider
   public health benefit. The aim of this paper is to describe the process
   used to develop a peer support intervention to encourage dietary
   behaviour change towards a MD in non-Mediterranean adults at high CVD
   risk.MethodsThe Medical Research Council (MRC) and Behaviour Change
   Wheel (BCW) frameworks and the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity,
   Motivation, Behaviour) theoretical model were used to guide the
   intervention development process. We used a combination of evidence
   synthesis and qualitative research with the target population, health
   professionals, and community health personnel to develop the
   intervention over three main stages: (1) we identified the evidence base
   and selected dietary behaviours that needed to change, (2) we developed
   a theoretical basis for how the intervention might encourage behaviour
   change towards a MD and selected intervention functions that could drive
   the desired MD behaviour change, and (3) we defined the intervention
   content and modelled outcomes.ResultsA theory-based, culturally
   tailored, peer support intervention was developed to specifically target
   behaviour change towards a MD in the target population. The intervention
   was a group-based program delivered by trained peer volunteers over
   12-months, and incorporated strategies to enhance social support,
   self-efficacy, problem-solving, knowledge, and attitudes to address
   identified barriers to adopting a MD from the COM-B

Abstract = {{Understanding how threatened wildlife can coexist with humans over the
   long term is a central issue in conservation and wildlife management.
   Komodo National Park in Eastern Indonesia, harbors the largest extant
   populations of the endemic Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis).
   Consistent with global trends, this species is expected to be
   increasingly exposed to human activities and in particular growing
   ecotourism activities. Here we comprehensively evaluated how human
   activities affected individual and population level attributes of Komodo
   dragons. We compared Komodo dragons phenotypic (behaviour, body size,
   and body condition) and demographic (age structure, sex ratio, survival,
   and density) responses to variation in human activities across national
   park. Komodo dragons were found to exhibit pronounced responses to high
   human activity level relative to sites with low and negligible human
   activities. Komodo dragons exposed to ecotourism exhibited significantly
   less wariness, larger body mass, better body condition, and higher
   survival. These results are entirely consistent with ecotourism
   activities that provided Komodo dragons with long-term and substantial
   nutritional subsidies as a consequence of feeding and human food refuse.
   However, we also noted the potential negative consequences of altered
   behaviour and adult-biased populations in ecotourism areas which may
   influence demographic processes through intraspecific competition or
   predation. To address this issue, we recommend that three management
   strategies to be implemented in future include: (1) removal of
   human-mediated nutritional subsidies, (2) alternative ecotourism, and
   (3) spatial regulation of ecotourism. Furthermore, we advocate the
   development of approaches to achieve a socio-ecological
   sustainabilitythat benefits both people and wildlife conservation.}},

Title = {{Visit, consume and quit: Patch quality affects the three stages of
   foraging}},

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Foraging is a three-stage process during which animals visit patches,
   consume food and quit. Foraging theory exploring relative patch quality
   has mostly focused on patch use and quitting decisions, ignoring the
   first crucial step for any forager: finding food. Yet, the decision to
   visit a patch is just as important as the decision to quit, as quitting
   theories can only be used if animals visit patches in the first place.
   Therefore, to better understand the foraging process and predict its
   outcomes, it is necessary to explore its three stages together. We used
   the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as a model to
   investigate foraging decisions in response to food varying in quality.
   In particular, we tested whether patch nutritional quality affected the
   following: (1) patch visits; (2) behaviours at the patch during a
   foraging visit; and (3) patch quitting decisions (quantified using
   giving up densityGUD). Free-ranging possums were presented with diets
   varying in nitrogen content and concomitantly volatile organic compound
   (VOC) composition at feeding stations in the wild. We found that possums
   were able to distinguish between different quality foods from afar,
   despite the location of the diets changed daily. Possums used VOC (i.e.
   odour cues) emitted by the diets to find and select patches from a
   distance. High-quality diets with higher protein and lower fibre were
   visited more often and for longer. Possums spent more time foraging on
   diets high in nutritional content, resulting in lower GUDs. Our study
   provides important quantitative evidence that foraging efficiency plays
   out during all the three stages of the foraging process (i.e. visit,
   consume and quit), and demonstrates the significance of considering all
   these stages together in future studies and foraging models. Sensory
   cues such as food odours play a critical role in helping foragers,
   including mammalian herbivores, find high-quality food. This allows
   foragers to make quick, accurate and important decisions about food
   patches well before patch quitting decisions come into play.}},

Abstract = {{While biomedical researchers have long appreciated the influence of
   maternally derived glucocorticoids (GCs) on offspring phenotype,
   ecologists have only recently begun exploring its impact in wild
   animals. Interpreting biomedical findings within an ecological context
   has posited that maternal stress, mediated by elevations of maternal
   GCs, may play an adaptive role preparing offspring for a stressful or
   rigorous environment. Yet, the influence of maternal stress on offspring
   phenotype has been little studied in wild animals. We experimentally
   elevated GCs to ecologically relevant levels (mimicking increases in
   maternal stress hormones following a nonlethal predator encounter, a
   heat challenge, or a chasing or confinement stressor) in female eastern
   fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus during gestation. We tested the
   hypothesis that maternally derived stress hormones themselves are
   sufficient to alter offspring phenotype. Specifically, we examined the
   effects of experimentally elevated maternal GCs on fitness-relevant
   traits of the mother, her eggs and her subsequent offspring. We found
   that daily maternal GC elevation: (a) increased maternal antipredator
   behaviours and postlaying glucose levels; (b) had no effect on egg
   morphology or caloric value, but altered yolk hormone (elevated GC) and
   nutrient content; and (c) altered offspring phenotype including
   stress-relevant physiology, morphology and behaviour. These findings
   reveal that maternally derived GCs alone can alter offspring phenotype
   in a wild animal, changes that may be mediated via maternal behaviour,
   and egg hormone and nutrient content. Understanding the ecological
   consequences of these effects under different environmental conditions
   will be critical for determining the adaptive significance of elevated
   maternal GCs for offspring.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{817-827}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There are several cases of insular animal species exhibiting dramatic
   differences in body size when compared with mainland counterparts. Such
   pronounced morphological changes can arise from divergent selection via
   differing resource availability, competition or predation pressure. Past
   studies have not been able to demonstrate a reversal of these
   morphological changes when populations are removed from their island
   situation. This study examines the body size response of populations of
   the Barrow Island dwarf' subspecies of golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus
   barrowensis: Ramsay, 1887) following translocation to an island and
   mainland site within their former range. Skeletal and mass measurements,
   body condition and fecundity of released animals and their offspring
   were compared to data from the source population. When comparing
   bandicoots born at translocation sites to source populations, males were
   significantly larger in skeletal size and mass, females were also
   significantly larger and exhibited higher reproductive output (number,
   frequency and average mass of pouch young). These effects occurred in a
   gradient according to environmental conditions, where animals were
   smallest and least productive at the densely populated source site,
   larger and more productive on a nearby island, and largest and most
   productive at a mainland site with some nutritional supplementation.
   These changes in skeletal size, mass and fecundity took place in the
   first 1-4 generations (18months post-release), suggesting that the
   response is not explained by natural selection. We posit that the small
   size of golden bandicoots on Barrow Island (315.8 +/- 4.2g, this study,
   cf 569.4 +/- 19.3g, mainland) is not a genotypic response to selective
   pressures, but rather a reversible phenotypic response to more
   favourable environmental conditions. A reduction in competitive
   pressures appeared to allow bandicoots to grow to a larger size and
   mass, and allow greater reproductive output. Ecological processes
   relating to resource limitation appear to drive island dwarfism' in
   I.auratus, and may apply to other insular species with morphological
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{According to climate science, ocean warming is one of the current and
   future greatest threats to coastal ecosystems. Projection scenarios for
   the end of this century show that tropical intertidal ecosystems are
   particularly at risk. In this study we optimized and tested a holistic
   method for bio-monitoring present and projected thermal pressure in such
   ecosystems, in order to assess organism vulnerability to ocean warming.
   Several species representative of different animal groups (fish,
   crustaceans and gastropods) were collected from the field and subjected
   to an experimental trial for 28 days, testing two temperatures: control
   (present seawater summer temperature) and elevated temperature (+3
   degrees C, projected seawater temperature anomaly for 2100). Muscle
   samples were collected weekly to quantify several biomarkers of: i)
   macromolecular damage (protein unfolding and denaturation, and lipid
   peroxidation), ii) reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers (antioxidant
   enzymes), and iii) body condition (energy reserves and body mass). These
   biomarkers were combined in integrated biomarker response (IBR) indices,
   either in three separate stress response categories (as previously
   defined) or in a unique combined analysis of overall physiological
   performance. Both approaches suggest that temperature affected IBRs,
   with increasing temperatures significantly impairing the overall health
   of individuals. Biomarkers of lower levels of biological organization
   indicated deleterious effects of temperature, whereas biomarkers of
   higher levels suggested maintenance of performance after chronic
   exposure. Overall indices combining the estimates of biomarkers across
   levels of biological organization are essential to predict the
   vulnerability of species, or populations, to climate warming. Such
   indices may assist managers and stakeholders in the establishment of
   monitoring programs and environmental policies toward the conservation
   of fragile coastal systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to establish a minimally invasive rumenostomy
   technique in sheep. Five 8-month old male sheep underwent exploratory
   laparoscopy using two 10-mm portals. The trocars were inserted in the
   paralombar fossa of the animals using thee technique of Hasson. During
   the examination, the rumen was visualized and grasped with a babcock
   forceps then brought near to the second portal and, simultaneously, the
   abdomen was deflated. Using a scalpel blade, a puncture incision was
   made in the rumen, through which a Foley Catheter (5 mL, 2-Way, 18
   Fr/Ch, 6.0 mm) was inserted. After the cuff was inflated, a purse-string
   suture was performed around the catheter, penetrating only the serous
   layer of the rumen. Then two cruciate sutures were applied for
   rumenopexy. Finally, the muscle layer was synthesized, followed by skin
   suture, with two horizontal mattress sutures lateral to the catheter. A
   single dose of 20 mg/kg of oxytetracycline was administered and, if
   necessary, rescue analgesia with 5 mg/kg of tramadol. Ruminal fluid was
   collected daily to test the viability of the catheter, and wound healing
   around the surgical wound was evaluated. Surgical time and
   trans-surgical complications were recorded and post-surgical pain was
   also assessed, using a behavioral scale. After 65 days, the animals were
   sent to the slaughterhouse where carcass analysis was performed, mainly
   observing the place where the Foley Catheter was placed. All animals
   presented satisfactory recovery, and no need for analgesia at any time.
   Throughout the entire period, there was no extravasation of rumenal
   fluid through the surgical wound, not even when the catheter was
   removed. This study shows that the minimally invasive technique of
   rumenostomy performed was efficient, with extremely advantageous
   results, both in the execution of the technique and well-being of the
   animals. It may be still very important for nutritional and
   digestibility studies, as well as for relapsing tympani therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Plasticity in life-history traits and behaviors allows organisms to
   track spatial environmental variation, such as that resulting from a
   latitudinal gradient. In estuaries, hydrological patterns can vary
   greatly with latitude, causing variable habitat use patterns across a
   species range. For Common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis) a large
   euryhaline fish, seasonal movements between the open estuary and
   freshwater reaches of rivers have been documented. We hypothesized that
   the timing of river use by Snook would be driven primarily by the
   magnitude of freshwater inflow, except at the northern limit of its
   range where lethal water temperatures may be a stronger influence. Data
   from electrofishing studies (20122016) conducted in rivers associated
   with four estuaries along a latitudinal gradient in western Florida were
   compared for seasonal differences in Snook abundance using negative
   binomial regression. In rivers of southwestern Florida (those in
   Everglades and Charlotte Harbor), Snook abundances increased three-fold
   during the time of year when surface waters inundating floodplains
   recede and force prey into the main stems of rivers. These
   hydrologically driven processes, and surges in Snook abundance, occurred
   during spring in the Everglades and fall in rivers of Charlotte Harbor.
   In Tampa Bay rivers, which have less freshwater inflow than the rivers
   farther south, Snook abundance differed little between seasons. In
   spring-fed rivers north of Tampa Bay, Snook abundances in fall and
   winter were twice those of spring and summer; stable water temperatures
   were thought to provide thermal refuge at the northernmost range of
   Snook. This work illustrates how the timing of habitat use by a species,
   and the underlying reasons, can differ greatly among sites. It also
   demonstrates the value of cross-site comparisons in providing for a more
   complete understanding of how a species uses available habitats across
   its range.}},

   indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection

Abstract = {{Regulation of food systems exists to ensure safety and enhance consumer
   confidence in the food which they purchase and consume. However, some
   regulatory systems fail to instil public confidence. In China for
   example, trust in the domestic food system is low as a consequence of
   multiple high-profile food scandals, many of which linked to food fraud.
   Fraud occurs when food is intentionally adulterated for economic gain
   and may, but not always, pose a risk to the safety of food. Food
   authenticity and quality may also be compromised. The focus of this
   research relates to how Chinese consumers perceive food fraud and make
   choices in the absence of trust in regulatory systems. Seven focus
   groups with middle class Chinese participants in tier 1 and 2 cities
   (Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu) were conducted to explore attitudes of
   and perception towards food fraud. Infant milk formula, olive oil and
   Scotch whisky were used as prompts for attitudinal and perceptual
   elicitation. The findings indicated that Chinese consumers consider food
   fraud to represent a food hazard that poses a threat to the
   authenticity, quality and reliability of food and increased the risk of
   purchasing and consuming of unsafe food. Consumers were found to rely on
   informal kinship networks as trusted sources of information regarding
   food products' authenticity and safety. Behavioural responses included a
   range of risk relieving strategies to support food purchasing
   judgements, in the perceived absence of regulatory protection, that
   included: pre-purchase and consumption information seeking; the use of
   product attributes as authenticity cues; carefully selected acquisition
   sources; as well as a range of domestically-situated food practices. The
   strategic implications for food companies and policy are discussed.}},
