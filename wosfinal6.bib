Abstract = {{Sex-specific predation on adult individuals is often predicted by
   different behaviour in males and females resulting from different
   reproductive strategies and social systems. High predation pressure and
   the need for biparental care are considered a possible ecological basis
   for the evolution of monogamy, the most puzzling social system in
   mammals. In species where adults and offspring are vulnerable to the
   same predators, males and females-may protect their offspring to
   different extents because of conflicting demands of investment in
   current and future offspring. I present the first empirical data on age-
   and sex-specific predation pressure by top predators on a monogamous
   rodent and the sex-specific behavioural responses of the prey species to
   different rates of predation. During an annual predation peak, only
   offspring and adult males were killed but no females. Whereas males and
   females travelled similar distances at night before the period of high
   predation on offspring, males moved further during this period. At the
   same time, males and females increased their distance from their
   offspring but males stayed closer to them than females. As a
   consequence, the distance between the members of the pair increased
   during the predation peak. The males' behaviour could lead to their
   encountering predators more frequently which would reduce survival
   prospects. The different behaviour of males and females provides
   empirical evidence that males invest in the welfare of current offspring
   at the cost of higher predation risk whereas females protect their
   residual reproductive value. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Does caloric restriction induce hormesis?}},
Journal = {{HUMAN \& EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{320-329}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The question of whether caloric restriction (CR) is hermetic is
   addressed in terms of two common definitions of the term. In terms of
   the older definition, i.e., a growth-stimulatory effect when lower doses
   of a compound which resulted in growth inhibition at higher doses, CR is
   better characterized as a co-hormetic (i.e., a paradigm which at
   relatively ``low doses,{''} in combination with some stimulus, will
   evince increased growth (proliferation) and at higher ``doses{''} will
   inhibit this increased proliferation) rather than a hermetic agent.
   Mechanisms such as cellular selection of cellular subpopulations,
   increases in receptor efficiency, and preservation of cellular
   proliferative potential can interact with agents and produce increased
   growth as long as the CR is not too severe.
   In terms of a broader definition, i.e., nonmonotonic dose-response
   behavior of a compound for any adverse response, CR appears to be
   hermetic, both as a result of body weight (BW) loss and other potential
   mechanisms. The impact of changes in BW, or frank CR, can be considered
   a component of every test for hormesis, and is thus capable for
   interaction with any other agent. The changes that BW loss (or CR)
   induce are so profound that any aspect of an agent's action -
   metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics - can modulate the
   response of an organism to an agent. Similarly, other effects of a
   chemical that induce BW loss, e.g., physical activity or temperature
   dysregulation, can also induce dose-response curves that appear
   hermetic. The interaction of the hermetic agents of BW loss and CR can
   influence agent tests.
   Controlling these factors may make it possible to dissect the key
   components of a hermetic response. In addition, the effects of CR or BW
   loss appear to extrapolate well across species {[}Colman R, Kemnitz JW.
   Aging experiments using nonhuman primates. In: Yu BP (Ed), Methods in
   Aging Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1999, pp. 249-267]. Thus
   there is some reason to believe that these hermetic factors may be
   important for humans, and may already be a factor for tests of adverse
   agents already conducted in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Damage by herbivorous spider mites induces plants to produce volatiles
   that attract predatory mites that consume the spider mites. A clear
   attraction to volatiles from Lima bean plants infested with the spider
   mite Tetranychus urticae has been consistently reported during more than
   15 years for the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. We have
   monitored the response to volatiles from spider-mite infested Lima bran
   plants for a laboratory population of the predatory mite from 1991 to
   1995 on a regular basis. A reduction in the level of attraction in the
   laboratory population of P. persimilis was recorded in mid-1992. The
   attraction of the laboratory population was weaker than that of a
   commercial population in the latter part of 1992, but the responses of
   these two populations were similarly weak in 1994 and 1995. Therefore, a
   behavioral change has also occurred in this commercial population.
   Experiments were carried out to address the potential causes of this
   change in attraction. The attraction of predators from a commercial
   population with a strong response decreased after being reared in our
   laboratory. Within a predator population with a low degree of
   attraction, strongly responding predators were present and they could be
   isolated on the basis of their behavior: predators that stayed on
   spider-mite infested plants in the rearing set-up had a strong
   attraction, while predators that had dispersed from the rearing set-up
   were not attracted to prey-infested bean plants. From our laboratory
   population with a low degree of attraction, isofemale lines were
   initiated and maintained for more than 20 generations. All isofemale
   lines exhibited a consistently strong attraction to spider mite-induced
   plant volatiles, similar to the attraction recorded for several
   populations in the past 15 years. Neither in a population with a strong
   attraction nor in two with a weak attraction was the response of the
   predators affected by a starvation period of 1-3 hr. Based on these
   results, possible causes for the observed reduction in predator
   attraction to spider mite-induced bran volatiles are discussed. The
   predatory mite P. persimilis is a cornerstone of biological control in
   many crops worldwide. Therefore. the change in foraging behavior
   recorded in this predator may have serious consequences for biological
   control of spider mites.}},

Abstract = {{An individual-based model of copepod behavioral responses to vertically
   patchy food was developed. It was hypothesized that a decrease in step
   length inversely proportional to the concentration of food
   (area-restricted search) would result in aggregation of the copepods
   within food patches, and a high value of food eaten/distance traveled.
   The performance of the copepods using the step-length reduction behavior
   was compared with two control behaviors. Copepods were allowed to forage
   through simulated distributions, and other distributions based on a
   high-resolution, field-sampled, vertical profile of fluorescence. The
   step-length reduction behavior led to higher values of food
   eaten/distance traveled, due to a significant portion (>30\% at times)
   of the population that did extremely well compared with the others, in
   both the theoretical and real field-sampled distributions. The
   step-length reduction behavior also led to higher spatial correlation
   between the food and the copepods. This strategy should allow some
   copepods to bypass local food maxima, where they might not meet their
   daily feeding requirements, and reach the area of highest food
   concentration within the water column. Copepods foraging within
   smoothed,versions of the field profiles received little benefit from the
   step-length reduction behavior, emphasizing the importance of sampling
   the environment on the appropriate scale.}},

Abstract = {{To begin identifying what behavioral details might be needed to

   of prey behaviorally responding to predation risk. We consider a fixed
   behavior model in which prey use constant levels of foraging effort and
   three flexible behavior models in which prey change their foraging
   effort according to their physiological state and their perceived level
   of predation risk. Flexible behavior was destabilizing at the community
   level as evidenced by higher predator-prey oscillations and lower
   community persistence times. The mechanisms by which prey estimated
   predation risk also affected community stability. We found that
   community dynamics resulting from prey with flexible behavior and fixed
   perception of risk approximated community dynamics resulting from prey
   with flexible behavior and perfect information about predation risk,
   however neither approximated the community dynamics resulting from prey

Abstract = {{The swimming behaviour of adult Daphnia largely governs their depth,
   which has a direct effect on both individual foraging success and
   predation avoidance. We treated individual swimming behaviour as a
   threshold character and used directional changes in average clonal depth
   within experimental tubes as a test for character plasticity. We
   compared the swimming behaviours of two cohabiting, phenotypically
   similar Daphnia (Daphnia galeata and Daphnia galeata-Daphnia rosea
   hybrid) to determine (1) whether there is inherited variation (H-2) for
   different traits (responses to hunger and predator cues); (2) whether
   changes in genetic parameters (norm of reaction and character state)
   across four environments could be simulated by combinations of the
   presence or absence of a predator cue and high or low hunger levels; and
   (3) whether these Daphnia would respond to directional selection,
   particularly in a trade-off environment thigh hunger and predator cue
   treatments). Responses of both D. galeata and the D. galeata- rosea
   hybrid to hunger and a predator cue and the trade-off environment were
   plastic. Daphnia galeata expressed significant genetic variation within
   (H-2) and between environments (heritability of plasticity): Both the
   character state and norm of reaction estimates of heritable variation in
   the hybrid were close to zero. Genetic correlations were positive and
   stable across six environmental pairs in Daphnia galeata. Most hybrid
   genetic correlations were not significant. The phenotypic distributions
   of both D. galeata and the hybrid were bimodal in the trade-off
   environment. The D. galeata distribution was partly due to between-clone
   variation and the hybrid distribution was almost entirely due to
   within-clone variation. Genetic variation expressed by D. galeata in the
   trade-off environment appears to depend on both clone by environment
   interactions and stable inherited differences. These results indicate
   that while plastic phenotypic responses cause a similar opportunity for
   selection in D. galeata and the hybrid, their responses to selection
   would be different in;the trade-off and in related environments. (C)

Abstract = {{The rate at which parents deliver energy to their brood is an important
   factor in avian reproduction because poor condition caused by
   malnutrition may reduce the offspring's survival to breeding. Models of
   central place foraging predict that nesting parents should optimize
   their prey delivery rate by minimizing travelling distances and by
   selecting patches where the gain per unit cost is high. I investigated
   the allocation of searching time amongst food patches in the home ranges
   of breeding great tits, Pants major, and blue tits P. caeruleus, by
   radiotracking. The density of locations in individual trees was
   positively correlated with prey biomass within trees and negatively with
   the distance of the trees from the nest. These two factors explained
   52\% of the variance in the allocation of the birds' search time. In
   rich patches, food was reduced considerably within 20 m of the nests;
   and the birds' travelling distances increased significantly during the
   nestling period. In parallel to foraging selectively in rich resources
   near the nest, the birds continually sampled the trees in their
   territory. The average surplus search time due to resource exploration
   was 1.52 times (range 1.25-1.99) the expected search time if the birds
   had exclusively used the most profitable patch. Despite considerable
   effort in patch sampling, the overall search time per unit prey was 30\%
   better than expected by an equal use of trees. The results suggest that

Abstract = {{Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is a computational technique that
   has been used to model daily routines of foraging in small birds. A
   diurnal bird must build up its fat reserves towards dusk in order to
   avoid starvation during the night, when it cannot feed. However, as well
   as the benefits of avoiding starvation, storing fat imposes costs such
   as an increased predation risk and higher flight and metabolic costs.
   There is therefore an optimal level of fat reserves for a bird to reach
   at dusk in order to survive overnight without being left with excessive
   fat reserves at dawn. I tested a prediction common to all SDP models of
   daily foraging routines, that a bird will attempt to reach this level at
   dusk, regardless of its fat reserves the previous dawn. I provided
   supplementary food to manipulate the fat reserves at dawn of free-living
   European robins, Erithacus rubecula. Diurnal changes in body mass (a

Abstract = {{Hunger/satiation state interacts with appetitive and noxious stimuli to
   determine feeding and avoidance responses. In the predatory marine snail
   Pleurobranchaea californica, food chemostimuli induced proboscis
   extension and biting at concentration thresholds that varied directly
   with satiation state. However, food stimuli also tended to elicit
   avoidance behavior (withdrawal and avoidance turns) at concentration
   thresholds that were relatively low and fixed. When the feeding
   threshold for active feeding (proboscis extension with biting) was
   exceeded, ongoing avoidance and locomotion were interrupted and
   suppressed. Noxious chemostimuli usually stimulated avoidance, but, in
   animals with lower feeding thresholds for food stimuli, they often
   elicited feeding behavior. Thus, sensory pathways mediating appetitive
   and noxious stimuli may have dual access to neural networks of feeding
   and avoidance behavior, but their final effects are regulated by
   satiation state. These observations suggest that a simple cost-benefit
   computation regulates behavioral switching in the animal's foraging
   behavior, where food stimuli above or below the incentive level for
   feeding tend to induce feeding or avoidance, respectively. This decision
   mechanism can weigh the animal's need for nutrients against the
   potential risk from other predators and the cost of relative energy
   outlay in an attack on prey. Stimulation of orienting and attack by
   tow-revel noxious stimuli in the hungriest animals may reflect
   risk-taking that can enhance prey capture success. A simple, hedonically

Abstract = {{Juvenile thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus,
   are less vigilant (i.e. they spend less time visually scanning the
   environment) than adults. To determine whether nutritional need was a
   potential cause of this difference, we supplemented two groups of
   free-ranging juveniles during the predispersal stage, while juveniles
   were still near and around the natal burrows. The high-energy food group
   (HEF: 11 squirrels) received peanut butter and oats while the low-energy
   food group (LEF: seven squirrels) received lettuce. Adults (14
   squirrels) were also supplemented, but due to their greater home range
   sizes, it was not feasible to classify them as either HEF or LEF. To
   evaluate the effect of supplementation on antipredator vigilance, the
   behavioural act of visually scanning for predators, we videotaped
   individuals while they were foraging above ground during 5-min
   observation periods. Each squirrel was observed and weighed during three
   time periods over 23 days. From the videotape, we extracted measures of
   time spent vigilant, locomoting and foraging. All three categories of
   squirrels gained mass over the study period, but the HEF juveniles
   rapidly exceeded that of the LEF juveniles. Early in the study, LEF and
   HEF juveniles did not significantly differ in either body mass or time
   budgets, and, initially, both juvenile groups were similar to adults in
   the amount of time devoted to vigilance. Later in the study, the
   behaviour of HEF juveniles closely resembled that of adults (increased
   time devoted to vigilance and decreased time devoted to foraging), while
   LEF juveniles decreased vigilance and increased their foraging time.
   This study indicates that for thirteen-lined ground squirrels the lower
   vigilance of juveniles is due, at least in part, to the greater
   nutritional needs of young animals with consequent increases in
   foraging, which is largely incompatible with vigilance. (C) 2000 The

Pages = {{593-601}},

Abstract = {{Wintering birds increase their fat reserves throughout the day, and
   impaired escape performance is often considered to be an important cost
   of fat reserves. Since lifting a larger mass requires more energy, if
   birds escape at maximum power output, an increase in mass will impair
   the escape flight. In this study we did not find support for
   mass-dependent escape performance for yellowhammers, Emberiza
   citrinella, and greenfinches, Carduelis chloris, with natural daily mass
   increases of 7-8\%. This suggests either that the birds were not
   performing at maximum output at dawn, when light, or that maximum power
   output was higher at dusk, when heavy. Either way the birds seemed to be
   able to put more effort into their escape flight when heavier. In both
   species, when alarmed, birds took off significantly faster and at a
   steeper angle than when not alarmed. Yellowhammers escaped at a higher
   speed and angle than greenfinches, and reacted faster to the predator
   model. This suggests that predator escape is more than just Newtonian
   physics, and may be influenced by behavioural, as well as morphological,
   adjustments. Different species may have evolved different responses to
   predation risk. Our results seem to be in disagreement with recent ideas
   about mass-dependent predation risk. However, to build up reserves,
   birds have to increase exposure time, which increases predation risk.
   This cost may be more important than impaired escape performance when
   relatively small, daily, changes in body mass are considered. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Zygiella x-notata is an orb-weaving spider that often renews its trap
   daily. Web building has associated costs and benefits, and building
   successive webs may have consequences for lifetime reproductive success.
   In the laboratory, we tested the ability of Z. x-notata to modify its
   building behaviour in response to various stages in predation (prey
   detection, capture and ingestion) experienced with a previous web. We
   determined which stages provided information for the spiders. Spiders
   that detected, captured and ingested prey and then rebuilt their web
   used less silk and made a smaller capture area than in the previous web.
   There was no effect of prey detection alone on the next web. Capture
   without feeding gave the same results as capture followed by feeding.
   The spiders that ate prey without detection and capture (feeding by
   hand) had the same energetic gains as spiders that caught prey but
   delayed building a new web. The spiders thus showed plasticity in
   web-building behaviour and in the amount of silk used (energetic
   investment) in the short term (from one web to the next). Changes in
   body condition may therefore influence web construction. Moreover,
   information gained during prey capture appeared to influence the size
   and structure of the next web. This ability should enable spiders to
   adapt their web building to maximize their fitness. (C) 2000 The

Abstract = {{1. We sought evidence for state-dependent behaviour and energy
   expenditure by manipulating the body-state of birds. We reviewed three
   hypotheses that could describe responses to a change in body-state: the
   Increased Effort; Reduced Effort; and Balanced Effort Hypotheses.
   2. Territorial European robins Erithacus rubecula L. were captured at
   dusk during winter, and chilled or warmed overnight to manipulate
   body-state.
   3. The robins were released onto their territories before dawn. Their
   subsequent behaviour was monitored by radio-tracking, and energy
   expenditure was measured using the doubly labelled water technique.
   4. Robins with high overnight energy expenditures (= `negative'
   body-state; chilled) were less likely to initiate vocal behaviour, and
   less likely to respond to the song or calls of conspecifics than those
   with low overnight expenditures (= `positive' body-state; warmed).
   5. Chilled birds moved around their territories at almost twice the rate
   of warmed birds, and had significantly higher daytime energy
   expenditures.
   6. We concluded that behaviour, including vocalizations and activity
   levels, and energy expenditures of robins, were sensitive to
   manipulations of body-state.
   7. These behaviours are interpreted as adaptive responses to restore
   condition, while minimizing the risk of mortality from predation and
   starvation. Our results were consistent with the Balanced Effort
   Hypothesis, entailing an increase in energy expenditure on foraging and
   a reduction in expenditure on non-maintenance activities.
   8. We suggest that inter-individual differences in body-state may be a
   key cause of previously unexplained variation in daily energy
   expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{In many amphibian larvae a suite of morphological and behavioural
   characters varies together in an induced defence against predators, but
   it remains unclear which features are functionally related to defence.
   We independently manipulated behaviour and morphology in tadpoles of
   Hyla versicolor and assessed their consequences for swimming performance
   and predator escape. Data on burst swimming showed that tadpoles which
   accelerated rapidly were elongate, with shallow bodies and tails.
   Predator escape was measured by exposing tadpoles to predators (larval
   Anax dragonflies or larval Ambystoma salamanders) and recording time
   until death. Tadpoles were first reared for 30 days in ponds containing
   either caged Anax or no predators; individuals responded to predators by
   developing large brightly coloured tails and short bodies. We placed
   tadpoles of both morphological phenotypes into plastic tubs, and
   manipulated their behaviour using food and chemical cues from predators.
   Mortality risk experienced by the predator-induced phenotype was about
   half that of the no-predator phenotype, and risk increased with time
   spent swimming. An interaction between morphology and behaviour arose
   because increasing activity caused higher risk for tadpoles with deep
   tail fins but not shallow tail fins.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in mean food availability, and in the variance around the
   mean, affects the growth rate during development. Previous theoretical
   work on the influence of environmental quality or growth rates on the
   phenotypic traits age and size at maturation assumed that there is no
   variation in growth rate or food availability within a generation. We
   develop a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model of the foraging
   behaviour of aphidophagous syrphids, and use this model to predict when
   syrphids should pupate (mature) when average food availability changes,
   or varies stochastically, during development.
   The optimal strategy takes into account not only the availability of
   food, but also the timing of its availability. Food availability, when
   small, influences developmental time, but not weight at pupation. Food
   availability, when large, influences weight at pupation, but not
   developmental time. When the food supply is low, the optimal strategy
   adjusts the size at pupation downwards for stochastic as opposed to
   deterministic availability of food. The conclusions reinforce the need
   for life-history studies to consider state dependence and short-term
   variability in growth rates. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Body size affects survival probabilities, reproductive output and

   Boeckella triarticulata and Diaptaomus leptopus. Individuals of both

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of seed size on patch use and diet selection for
   three co-existing Negev Desert granivores: Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus
   allenbyi), greater Egyptian sand gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum). and
   crested lark (Galerida cristata). We manipulated size and spatial
   distribution of seeds in experimental food patches and quantified
   foraging behavior by measuring giving-up densities (GUDs: the amount of
   food remaining in a resource patch following exploitation by a forager).
   In one experiment, we presented small (< 1.4 mm in diameter cracked
   wheat). medium (2.0-3.3 mm), and large (> 3.4 mm) seeds in separate
   trays; in a second, we presented small and medium seeds separately and
   mixed together. Gerbils had a higher handling lime efficiency on smaller
   seeds, but a much higher encounter probability on larger seeds (20 times
   higher on large than medium seeds, and 2-5 times higher on medium than
   small seeds). This led gerbils to have significantly lower GUDs on
   larger seeds than smaller seeds and to harvest a higher proportion of
   the larger seeds. When presented with rich and poor patches G. allenbyi
   tended to equalize GUDs in both patches, indicating a quitting harvest
   rate rule For patch exploitation. In contrast. larks appeared to use a
   fixed time rule for patch exploitation. For larks, seed size did not
   influence encounter probabilities, and they showed no seed-size
   selectivity. Still, larks had higher handling efficiencies on smaller
   than larger seeds, and consequently had a significantly lower GUD on
   small than medium seeds. Despite large differences between the gerbils
   and larks in their foraging, our results do not support species
   coexistence via seed-size partitioning: the larks had much higher GUDs
   than the gerbils on all seed sizes. Nonetheless, seed size, seed
   abundance, seed distribution and the animal's patch use behavior all
   played major roles in determining gerbils' and larks' diet selectivities

Abstract = {{Food quality of ladybirds is known to influence the biological
   performances of the aphidophagous predators. Development (larval. and
   total durations, mortality) and reproduction of the beetle are modified
   by changes of both prey species and their relative host plants.
   Suitablity of many aphid species was already studied and was observed to
   induce lower consumption until complete rejection of preys by some
   aphidophagous predators. Even if polyphagous insects are considered,
   some aphid species provide only low quality food including sometimes
   toxic compounds.
   In response to low nutritional value or food limitation, many insects
   have evolved developmental plasticity in which larvae mature more
   rapidly, leading to smaller body size adult. Here we investigate the
   effect of food quality represented by aphid species on Adalia bipunctata
   reproduction after having relaxed the nutritive selection from adult
   emergence. Reciprocal crosses between emerging adults fed with
   Acyrthosiphon pisum (optimal diet) or Aphis fabae (unappreciated diet)
   demonstrated that negative effect of the latter aphid species was
   maternally inherited. Female fecundity (egg laying and egg numbers per
   female) and egg viability was observed for each cross and compared to a
   full A. fabae nutrition (for both male and female at larval and adult
   stages) and A. pisum references. This environmentally based maternal
   effect was directly linked to developmental parameters induced by larvae
   nutrition. Influence of aphid prey constitute an important change of
   predator environment which was discussed in relation to biological
   control efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{The field slug, Deroceras reticulatum, a common pest of agricultural and
   horticultural crops, is a generalist herbivore with distinct preferences
   for particular food items. However, these preferences are not fixed, but
   are influenced by the recent dietary history of the slugs. In
   particular, slugs tend to select novel food items ('neophilia'). We
   investigated the basis of such influences, using artificial diets in
   which protein and carbohydrate composition could be controlled and
   non-nutritional ('secondary') chemicals added as flavours. The slugs
   showed no general inclination for neophilia based on taste alone. There
   was a possible learned association between protein content and taste,
   but this was weakly expressed. However, the slugs selected food items,
   when given a choice, containing nutrients that were deficient in earlier
   diets, even though all the food items contained the same familiar
   secondary taste chemicals. Injections of missing nutrients into the
   haemocoel of slugs inhibited such changes in food preference, indicating
   that slugs' feeding preferences are influenced directly by their
   internal nutritional status. We suggest that neophilia in D. reticulatum
   is a physiological response to a nutritional imbalance arising from a
   suboptimal diet. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Treatment for brain injury has focused on neuroprotection against brain
   edema, brain ischemia, and control of intracranial hypertension in
   animal studies. However, these concerts are not successful in the
   management of in severely brain-injured patients, because animal studies
   do not include information about the influence of the excess response of
   systemic circulatory-metabolic changes and hypothalamus-pituitary
   endocrine axis dysfunction caused by anesthesia. In our recent clinical
   studies of severe brain injury, the management of restoration therapy of
   dying neurons in injured brain tissue before neuroprotection therapy
   produced successful clinical results. Three major targets of treatment
   are important: Adequate administration of oxygen and metabolic
   substrates, control of excess release of vasopressin and growth hormone
   for prevention of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and cytokine
   encephalitis, and preclusion of selective neuronal radical damage of the
   dopamine A 10 nervous system for prevention of vegetation. Management of
   intensive care is focused on three subsequent targets: Initial care
   management is to maintain sufficient cerebral oxygenation and adequate
   brain metabolism by control of PaO2/FiO(2) above 300, systolic blood
   pressure above 100 mmHg, serum glucose at 120-140 mg/dl, brain
   temperature at 34 degrees-32 degrees C, ICP below 20 mmHg,
   antithrombin-III (AT-III) above 100\%, hemoglobin 2,3 diphosphoglycerate
   at 12-15 mmol/mL, serum pH above 7.3, oxygen delivery above 800 ml/min,
   and fluid resuscitation. The second target is control of
   hypothalamus-pituitary axis activation by management of brain tissue
   temperature at 34 degrees C with 120-140 mg/d serum glucose, 9\% saline
   followed by 4\% saline fluid resuscitation, AT-III above 100\% followed
   by replacement of albumin drip, and maintaining serum albumin higher
   than 3.5 g/dl within 2-3 h after injury. The third target is to prevent
   the selective neuronal damage of the dopamine A 10 nervous system by
   controlling brain tissue temperature at 32 degrees-33 degrees C with
   management of Hb above 11 g/dl and administration of vitamin E and C.
   However, in brain hypothermia treatment, there are five major pitfalls:
   hemoglobin dysfunction associated with masking brain hypoxia, inadequate
   management of brain tissue temperature with hyperglycemia, undesirable
   duration of brain hypothermia, inadequate care management of systemic
   infections, and misunderstanding of nutritional issues in the management
   of brain injury. These pitfalls are discussed in this chapter. A novel
   technique for control of these clinical issues, the success of adequate
   neuronal oxygenation and brain metabolism, neurohormonal control of the
   blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and preservation of the dopamine A 10
   nervous system are explained. Prevention of brain edema, elevation of
   ICP, and neuroexcitaion are not mechanisms of brain hypothermia. The
   effectiveness of brain hypothermia treatment was studied by comparing
   the clinical results of brain hypothermia (99 cases) and normothermia
   (65 cases) of head injury with Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 6.
   Patients with initial GCS scores of 3 did not benefit from brain
   hypothermia treatment, but with GCS 4, 5, and 6, clinical benefit was
   observed. As clinical signs, memory, intelligence, and personality were
   not much disturbed in the brain hypothermia-treated group.}},

   availability were either offered or withheld in separate aquaria and the
   response in burrowing depth measured. Individuals burrowed more deeply

   vary according to the threat of predator attack. In a laboratory
   experiment we simulated predatory attack on individual amphisbaenians of
   the species Blanus cinereus, and specifically examined the effects of
   temperature (warm vs, cold) and predation threat (low vs. high) on
   escape decisions. Amphisbaenians showed significantly longer episodes of
   an alternative anti-predator behaviour on the soil surface (coiling)
   when the predation threat was high and when the temperature was low. The
   time to burrow until half of the body was buried was significantly
   longer when the temperature was low and was significantly shorter when
   the threat was high. The variations observed in anti-predator behaviours
   may reflect the choice of the optimal response under each circumstance,
   taking into account the estimated predation risk, which is dependent on
   the characteristics of the initial attack, and potential burrowing
   performance, which is dependent on body temperature.}},

Volume = {{123}},

Pages = {{497-505}},
Abstract = {{Age and size at metamorphosis are two important fitness components in
   species with complex life cycles. In anurans, metamorphic traits show
   remarkable phenotypic plasticity, especially in response to changes in
   growth conditions. It is also possible that the perception of risk
   directly determines changes in larval period and the size of metamorphs.
   This study examines how the perception of predation risk affects the
   timing of and size at metamorphosis in common frogs (Rana temporaria). I
   raised tadpoles at two risk levels (fish-conditioned water or
   unconditioned water) crossed with the availability or lack of food at
   night (all tadpoles had food available in the day). Tadpoles reacted to
   chemical cues from predatory fish by decreasing activity. A novel
   behavioural result was a predationXfood interaction effect on refuge
   use, which also accounted for most of the predator main effect:
   predation risk only caused increased refuge use in the night-starved
   treatment. Despite these behavioural modifications, the perception of
   predation risk did not affect growth rate and mass at metamorphosis in a
   simple way: the effects of food regime on growth and size at
   metamorphosis were dependent on the level of predation risk as revealed
   by significant predationXfood interaction effects. Tadpoles who had food
   withheld at night metamorphosed at the smallest size, suggesting a
   negative relationship between size at metamorphosis and refuge use.
   Tadpoles raised in fish-conditioned water had longer larval periods than
   those in unconditioned water, but these differences were significant
   only if food was available at night. These results conflict with the
   hypotheses that tadpoles should reduce their larval period or growth
   rates (and hence metamorphose at a smaller size) as the risk of
   predation increases. In contrast to predation risk, food availability
   strongly affected the length of the larval period: night-starved
   tadpoles metamorphosed relatively early with or without fish stimulus.
   Thus, early metamorphosis resulted from periods of low food
   availability, but not from a heightened ``perceived risk{''} of
   predation. This example counters the hypothesis of acceleration of the
   developmental rate (which shortens the time to metamorphosis) as a
   mechanism to escape a risky environment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Several studies have shown that hostility, as measured by the

   undertaken to examine associations between hostility and cardiovascular
   risk factors representing the metabolic syndrome in 1081 older men who
   participated in the Normative Aging Study. Methods: Subjects included
   men who completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in
   1986 and who participated in a subsequent laboratory examination within
   1 to 4 years. Total and subscale Ho scores were computed, and
   associations with anthropometric data, cigarette smoking, dietary
   information, serum lipids, blood pressure, and fasting glucose and
   insulin levels were examined. Results: The total Ho score was positively
   associated with waist/hip ratio, body mass index, total caloric intake,
   fasting insulin level, and serum triglycerides. The Ho score was
   inversely related to education and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   concentration. Path analysis also suggested that the effects of
   hostility on insulin, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol were mediated by its effects on body mass index and
   waist/hip ratio, which, in turn, exerted their effects on lipids and
   blood pressure through insulin. Conclusions: The results are consistent
   with those of prior research and also suggest that, in older men,
   hostility may be associated with a pattern of obesity, central
   adiposity, and insulin resistance, which can exert effects on blood
   pressure and serum lipids. Furthermore, effects of hostility on the
   metabolic syndrome appear to be mediated by body mass index and
   waist/hip ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Honest sexual signalling requires that the level of advertisement
   reveals mate quality. In the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus, females base their mate choice mainly on the intensity of the
   males' red breeding coloration. Different results have, however, been
   obtained on the relationship between red breeding coloration and
   physical condition. In this study, the relationship was curvilinear in a
   natural population, with males in good and poor condition (measured as
   lipid content) having larger red areas than males of intermediate
   condition. By manipulating food intake and thus male condition prior to
   breeding, I further show that poor condition can induce an increase in
   signalling effort. This effect was further strengthened when the
   predation cost of signalling was increased by exposing the males to
   predators. This suggests that the reason for the high signalling effort
   of males in poor condition is their low probability of future
   reproduction and thus lower cost of signalling in terms of loss of
   future reproductive opportunities. Males in poor condition signal as a
   terminal effort and take larger risks and invest more in current
   reproduction than males in good condition. Finally, I discuss whether an
   effect of decreasing residual reproductive value on signalling effort
   could result in the breakdown of the honesty of the signal. (C) 1999 The

Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{245-271}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The process of domestication involves adaptation, usually to a captive
   environment. Domestication is attained by some combination of genetic
   changes occurring over generations and developmental mechanisms (e.g.,
   physical maturation, learning) triggered by recurring environmental
   events or management practices in captivity that influence specific
   biological traits. The transition from free-living to captive status is
   often accompanied by changes in availability and/or accessibility of
   shelter, space, food and water, and by changes in predation and the
   social environment. These changes set the stage for the development of
   the domestic phenotype. Behavioral development in animals undergoing
   domestication is characterized by changes in the quantitative rather
   than qualitative nature of responses. The hypothesized loss of certain
   behavior patterns under domestication can usually be explained by the
   heightening of response thresholds. Increases in response frequency
   accompanying domestication can often be explained by atypical rates of
   exposure to certain forms of perceptual and locomotor stimulation.
   Genetic changes influencing the development of the domestic phenotype
   result from inbreeding, genetic drift, artificial selection, natural
   selection in captivity, and relaxed selection. Experiential
   contributions to the domestic phenotype include the presence or absence
   of key stimuli, changes in intraspecific aggressive interactions and
   interactions with humans. Man's role as a buffer between the animal and
   its environment is also believed to have an important effect on the
   development of the domestic phenotype. The domestication process has
   frequently reduced the sensitivity of animals to changes in their
   environment, perhaps the single-most important change accompanying
   domestication. It has also resulted in modified rates of behavioral and
   physical development. Interest in breeding animals in captivity for
   release in nature has flourished in recent decades. The capacity of
   domestic animals to survive and reproduce in nature may depend on the
   extent to which the gene pool of the population has been altered during
   the domestication process and flexibility in behavioral development.
   ``Natural{''} gene pools should be protected when breeding wild animals
   in captivity for the purpose of reestablishing free-living natural
   populations. In some cases, captive-reared animals must be conditioned
   to Live in nature prior to their release. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

   General activity was very high on entry to the lairage pen. Drinking and

Abstract = {{The size of an individual is a key feature influencing and determined by
   a species' life history and ecology. Here, I consider how life-history
   plasticity within a single species can influence the outcome of food web
   interactions along a productivity gradient. An individual can either
   reproduce early but remain susceptible to predators throughout its life
   (strategy 1) or delay reproduction and grow to a predator-invulnerable
   size refuge (strategy 2). At low productivity, strategy 1 is favored
   because the probability of growing to a size refuge is low compared to
   the probability of being eaten. Here, the system is consumer controlled,
   and predators have large effects on the food web. At high productivity,
   strategy 2 is favored because high food availability increases the
   probability of prey attaining size refuge before being eaten.
   Consequently, the system becomes less consumer controlled, and predators
   have weaker effects on food web dynamics. At intermediate productivity,
   either strategy 1 or strategy 2 can be favored, depending on the initial
   conditions of the system. Field and laboratory experiments with a common

   Atlantic salmon, we directly tested the hypothesis that relative growth
   rates should be correlated with willingness to risk exposure to a
   predator. We used size-matched transgenic and control salmon in two
   experiments where these fish could either feed in safety, or in the
   presence of the predator. The first experiment constrained the predator
   behind a Plexiglas partition (no risk of mortality), the second required
   the fish to feed in the same compartment as the predator (a fintie risk

   consumption that were approximately five times that of the control fish
   and rates of movement approximately double that of controls. Transgenic
   salmon also spent significantly more time feeding in the presence of the
   predator, and-consumed absolutely more food at that location. When there
   was a real risk of mortality, control fish almost completely avoided the

Abstract = {{Birds that range over a large area will have a greater mass-dependent

   change in winter mass and amount of food eaten in conjunction with the
   distance that blackbirds travelled to a randomly sited mobile feeder.
   Blackbirds that travelled shorter distances (per trip and in total) and
   less often to the feeder had the highest mass midwinter relative to
   their spring mass. Blackbirds with a higher mean mass midwinter also
   travelled, on average, shorter distances to the feeder. The distance an

   independent of food supply because distances actually increased at the

   h after lights-on (group C, n = 12). We examined the effects on
   locomotor, feeding and drinking activity, body mass, and food intake.
   Treatment did not affect daily locomotor, feeding, or drinking activity.
   Distribution of activity over the light period was affected: group B and
   C showed more activity above the feeder and water container outside the
   feeding time, and showed a large bout of locomotor and feeding activity
   at the start of this period. Both overall weight gain and gross energy
   intake (CEI) were highest in group A and lowest in group C. Distribution
   of food intake throughout the daily feeding period was affected: group B
   and C consumed more food during the first part of the feeding period
   than group A. Daily GEI in group C was influenced by fasting duration
   prior to feeding and by time of food availability. We suggest that young
   quail adjust their feeding behaviour in response to their instantaneous
   energy needs. This effect is modulated by time of food availability:
   food arriving later in the day led to higher intake levels.}},

Abstract = {{It is now widely accepted that obesity develops by way of genetic
   mechanisms conferring specific dispositions which interact with strong
   environmental pressures. It is also accepted that certain dispositions
   constitute metabolic risk factors for weight gain. It is less well
   accepted that certain patterns of behaviour (arising from biological
   demands or environmental influences) put individuals at risk of
   developing a positive energy balance and weight gain (behavioural risk
   factors). Relevant patterns of behaviour include long-lasting habits for
   selecting and eating particular types of foods. Such habits define two
   distinct groups characterized as high-fat (HF) and low-fat (LF)
   phenotypes. These habits are important because of the attention given to
   dietary macronutrients in body-weight gain and the worldwide epidemic of
   obesity. Considerable evidence indicates that the total amount of
   dietary fat consumed remains the most potent food-related risk factor
   for weight gain. However, although habitual intake of a high-fat diet is
   a behavioural risk factor for obesity, it does not constitute a
   biological inevitability. A habitual low-fat diet does seem to protect
   against the development of obesity, but a high-fat diet does not
   guarantee that an individual will be obese. Although obesity is much
   more prevalent among KF than LF, some HF are lean with BMI well within
   the normal range. The concept of `different routes to obesity' through a
   variety of nutritional scenarios can be envisaged, with predisposed
   individuals varying in their susceptibility to different dietary inputs.
   In a particular subgroup of individuals (young adult males) HF and LF
   displayed quite different profiles of appetite control, response to
   nutrient challenges and physiological measures, including BMR, RQ, heart
   rate, plasma leptin levels and thermogenic responses to fat and
   carbohydrate meals. These striking differences suggest that HF and LF
   can be used as a conceptual tool to investigate the relationship between
   biology and the environment (diet) in the control of body weight.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Research has linked eating disturbances with behavioral
   impulsivity. Little is known, however, about whether eating disturbances
   and aggressive behavior have a tendency to co-occur in the same girls.
   This article assesses the eating disturbance-aggressive behavior
   association and then examines the extent to which these factors confer a
   risk on drug use and attempted suicide. Method: Survey data were
   gathered from 3,630 girls in grades 6 through 12 in the upper Midwest.
   Girls responded anonymously to questions regarding binge eating and
   purging, dietary restriction, aggressive behavior, drug use, and
   attempted suicide. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the
   unique contribution of demographic variables, eating disturbances, and
   aggression on drug use and attempted suicide. Results: Eating
   disturbances were significantly associated with aggressive behavior.
   Girls who endorsed binge eating and purging or dietary restriction had
   odds of aggressive behavior 2 to 4 times higher than girls who did not
   endorse these items. Logistic regression revealed that eating
   disturbances and aggressive behavior were significantly associated with
   both drug use and attempted suicide. Conclusions: Eating disturbances
   are significantly associated with aggressive conduct in adolescent

   Food-limited H. helluo travelled further than satiated H. helluo, and

Abstract = {{During the course of ontogeny, odonates switch from being aquatic larvae
   to being terrestrial adults. Ontogenetic niche shift theory proposes
   that such shifts are adaptive and have evolved to maximize a growth rate
   (size) to mortality rate ratio. Individuals should therefore switch from
   one niche to the other at an optimal size or state. Since the majority
   of odonates are seasonal breeders, the extent to which the switch is
   optimal will depend upon the time and the resources available during
   postembryonic development. We collected a cohort of larvae that varied
   in how close they were to eclosion and reared them on either a
   high-nutrition or a low-nutrition diet. We then determined the relative
   influence of both time and nutritional constraints on survival and
   development rate, as well as the body size, size-corrected flight muscle
   mass and fat reserves of individuals at eclosion. Damselflies in both
   high- and low-nutrition treatments responded to a short development
   period by developing faster and reducing their body size, but did not
   change their proportional investment in fat reserves and flight muscle.
   Reduced larval nutrition resulted in decreased body size, flight muscle
   mass and fat reserves at eclosion. However, it had no effect on survival
   to eclosion, or development rate. We discuss these results in terms of

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Prey often respond to predator presence by increasing their use of
   refuges. However, unfavorable thermal conditions in refuges might entail
   physiological costs for an ectothermic prey. Thus, the decision of when
   to come out from a refuge should be optimized by considering the
   expected fitness effects of diminution of predation risk with time, but
   also by considering the cost of the loss of time spent at optimal body
   temperature maximizing physiological functions. The model of Ydenberg
   and Dill describes the trade-off between risk and cost for a prey
   fleeing to a refuge. We present a special case of this model to predict
   how emergence time from the refuge in lizards or other ectotherms should
   vary as a function of risk of predation and thermal costs of refuge use.
   The analyses of the variation in emergence time from a refuge of Lacerta
   monticola lizards in the held under two different predation risk levels
   supported the predictions of the model. As predicted, time spent in the
   refuge tvas longer when the threat of the initial attack had been
   higher, and therefore the subsequent diminution of risk was slower, but
   only when lizards emerged at the same place where they hid. When initial
   body temperature was high, some lizards decreased emergence time by
   emerging from a different place. In addition, the effects of thermal
   costs were more relevant in the highrisk situation. Time spent in the
   refuge under high risk increased when thermal conditions of the refuge
   were more similar to thermal conditions outside (i.e., physiological
   costs of refuge use were lower). We conclude that optimization of
   refuge-use strategies might help lizards cope with changes in predation
   risk without incurring excessive physiological costs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{172-179}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of South Africa's principal tourist attractions is the
   opportunity to encounter Africa's large mammals in the wild. Attacks by
   these mammals can be exceptionally newsworthy with potentially
   deleterious effects on tourism. Little is known about the risk of injury
   and death caused by wild mammals to visitors to South Africa's nature
   reserves. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of fatal
   and nonfatal attacks on tourists by wild mammals in South Africa and to
   ascertain avoidable factors, if any.
   Methods: Commercial press records covering all South African Newspapers
   archived at the Independent Newspapers' central library were
   systematically reviewed for a 10-year period, January 1988 to December
   1997 inclusive, to identify all deaths and injuries to domestic and
   international tourists resulting from encounters with wild mammals in
   South Africa. All of these incidents were analyzed to ascertain
   avoidable factors.
   Results: During the review period seven tourists, including two students
   from Thailand and a German traveler, were killed by wild mammals in
   South Africa. Three of the four deaths ascribed to lions resulted from
   tourists carelessly approaching prides on foot in lion reserves. A
   judicial inquiry found that the management of a KwaZulu-Natal Reserve
   was culpable for the remaining death. Tourist ignorance of animal
   behavior and flagrant disregard of rules contributed to the two
   fatalities involving hippopotami. The unusual behavior manifested by the
   bull elephant responsible for the final death, resulted from discomfort
   caused by a dental problem to this pachyderm. During the same period
   there were 14 nonfatal attacks on tourists, including five by hippo,
   three by buffalo, two by rhino, and one each by a lion, leopard, zebra
   and musth elephant. Only the latter occurred while the visitor was in a
   motor vehicle. Tourist ethological naivete and failure to determine the
   experience of trail guides prior to travel, resulted in inadvertent
   agonistic behavior, unnecessary risk-taking and avoidable injury.
   Conclusions: This retrospective study has shown that attacks on tourists
   by wild mammals in South Africa are an uncommon cause of injury and
   death. Sensible precautions to minimize this risk include remaining in a
   secure motor vehicle or adequately fenced precincts while in the
   vicinity of large mammals, rigidly observing nature reserve
   instructions, never approaching animals that appear ill, malnourished,
   displaying aggressive behavior traits or female wild mammals with young,
   and demanding adequately trained and experienced game rangers when
   embarking on walking trails. Any behavior that might be construed as
   antagonistic and which could provoke an attack by large mammals should
   be avoided (e.g., driving directly at a lion). Visitors need to be
   informed of classic signs of aggression, in particular in elephants,
   which will allow timely avoidance measures to be taken. The
   risk-enhancing effect of excessive alcohol intake is undesirable in the
   game reserve setting, as is driving at high speed after dusk in areas
   where hippos graze. Local advice on personal safety in wildlife reserves
   and the credentials of trail guides should be obtained from lodge or
   reserve management, tourism authorities or the travel industry prior to
   travel to game reserves.}},

   These are hygienic conditions for the animal behaviour and the necessary

   The role of vaccinations in disease eradication prog rams becomes more

Abstract = {{Ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata) have been implicated in mortality of eggs
   and chicks of the beach-nesting Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) whose
   Atlantic Coast populations are listed as threatened. Through observation
   and experimentation, we investigated the interactions between ghost
   crabs and plovers on Wild Beach, a Piping Plover nesting area on
   Assateague Island, Virginia. This site has a high abundance of ghost
   crabs and historically low hedging success compared to adjacent areas
   with fewer crabs. We observed encounters of crabs with plover eggs,
   chicks, and adults in the field, but never predation. In staged
   encounters of crabs with eggs and chicks (using hatchery reared quail as
   plover surrogates), we were unable to elicit predatory behavior either
   on the beach or in the lab. We conclude that although instances of ghost
   crab predation on Piping Plover eggs and chicks occur, they are rare and
   cannot account for the high mortality frequently reported on beaches
   where ghost crabs are abundant. Adult plovers behave toward crabs as if
   they were dangerous to eggs and chicks, and their young broods in the
   study area did not forage along the foreshore. Hence, ghost crabs may
   increase mortality indirectly. Frequent responding to crabs by parents
   may attract more deadly brood predators. Brood nutrition may suffer as
   adult plovers direct chicks away from areas where forage is reportedly
   richer but crabs are abundant, such as the foreshore. Nutrient intake
   may be further reduced on more southerly breeding grounds where high
   temperatures on backshores force chicks to stop foraging and take
   shelter during mid-day. Although high mortality cannot be attributed
   directly to predation by crabs, it may be due to factors that covary
   with crab abundance, such as high temperature, behavioral responses of
   adult birds, and poor forage.}},

Abstract = {{Context Several observational epidemiological studies report an
   association of pregnancy and obstetric complications with development of
   antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in offspring. However, the
   precise nature and timing of the hypothesized biological insults are not
   known.
   Objective To test whether severe maternal nutritional deficiency early
   in gestation is associated with risk for ASPD in offspring.
   Design and Setting Retrospective cohort study. From October 1944 to May
   1945, the German army blockaded food supplies to the Netherlands,
   subjecting the western Netherlands first to moderate (official food
   rations, 4200-6300 kJ/d) then to severe (<4200 kJ/d) nutritional
   deficiency. The north and south were subjected to moderate nutritional
   deficiency only.
   Participants Dutch men born in large urban areas in 1944-1946 who were
   given psychiatric examinations for military induction at age 18 years (N
   = 100 543) were classified by the degree and timing of their prenatal
   exposure to nutritional deficiency based on their birthdate and
   birthplace.
   Main Outcome Measure Diagnosis of ASPD by psychiatric interview at time
   of medical examination for military induction, using the International
   Classification of Diseases, Sixth Revision (ICD-6).
   Results Men exposed prenatally to severe maternal nutritional deficiency
   during the first and/or second trimesters of pregnancy exhibited
   increased risk for ASPD (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR], 2.5; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.5-4.2). Third-trimester exposure to severe
   nutritional deficiency and prenatal exposure to moderate nutritional
   deficiency were not associated with risk for ASPD.
   Conclusions Our data suggest that severe nutritional insults to the
   developing brain in utero may be capable of increasing the risk for
   antisocial behaviors in offspring. The possible implications of these
   findings for both developed countries and developing countries, where
   severe nutritional deficiency is widespread and often exacerbated by
   war, natural disaster, and forced migration, warrant study.}},

   financial, and sometimes psychological, burden. Women often pursue
   thinner bodies despite already being at a healthy weight. This pursuit
   is motivated primarily to enhance appearance. The ideal body portrayed
   in the media has stabilized in thinness, but it is becoming increasingly
   tubular, i.e., taller with slimmer hips and thicker waist. This ideal is
   presented to adult and adolescent women in their popular magazines, and
   to little girls with their dolls. Exercise is promoted as an optimal
   means to achieve the ideal physique. Young American women tend to
   idealize an athletic body shape, especially with upper-body muscularity.
   This shape can be attained only through sustained exercise and
   upper-body strength training. Hi,oh-level exercise may be a precursor to
   eating disorders. Women who exercise to excess, who are highly
   preoccupied with weight, and who are characterized by perfectionism and
   an obsessive compulsive personality are at risk for eating disorders.
   When body weight and shape are kept in perspective and realistic goals
   are set, the physical, psychological, and financial costs of achieving
   or maintaining a healthy weight may be minimized.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recently, a small predatory beetle, Trechisibus antarcticus
   (Carabidae), was accidentally introduced onto the island of South
   Georgia, sub-Antarctic.
   2. From the presumed site of introduction the beetle is invading the
   coastal lowland area, building up high densities locally in the
   tussock-forming grass Parodiochloa flabellata.
   3. In the coastal area the endemic detritivorous/herbivorous beetle
   Hydromedion sparsutum (Perimylopidae) is common, especially in and
   beneath the tussocks.
   4. The first three, out of six, larval instars of H. sparsutum are
   easily taken prey by the carabid.
   5. In sites colonized by the carabid, total abundance and the ratio
   between larval and adult numbers of H. sparsutum are far lower, and its
   adult body size clearly larger, than in comparable sites where the
   carabid is absent.
   6. Two hypotheses are proposed for explaining the increase in adult body
   size of H. sparsutum: (i) the increase is a direct effect of predation:
   selection by the predator favours large hatchlings and/or larvae with a
   high growth rate; and (ii) the increase is an indirect effect of
   predation: by lowering the density of H. sparsutum, predation has
   increased its per capita food supply, enabling a higher growth rate and
   a larger adult body size.
   7. A food addition experiment in a carabid-free site showed availability
   of high quality food to be insufficient for sustaining the initial
   larval population.
   8. In the laboratory, females from the predator-infested sites produced
   larger eggs and hatchlings than females from the carabid-free sites, but
   mass specific growth rates of the larvae were not higher.
   9. Field and laboratory data give stronger support to the food
   hypothesis than to the size selectivity hypothesis.}},

Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The rapid response of animals to changes in predation risk has allowed
   behavioral ecologists to learn much about antipredator decision making.
   A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that
   it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so
   readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that
   temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of
   allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk
   situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its
   greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief
   and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort
   to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an
   increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations.
   However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to
   decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations
   as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in
   low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as
   much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions
   hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent
   behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also
   suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are
   maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief ``pulse{''} of
   high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator
   behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Variation among bird species in growth rates is traditionally attributed
   to differences in energy availability and developmental mode. However,
   the extent and form of competition among siblings for limited food
   resources may also be an important determinant. Kin-selection-based
   models of intrabrood competition suggest that nestling growth rates
   should be highest in those species in which siblings are likely to be
   less genetically related to one another (half-sibs rather than
   full-sibs). We test this novel prediction using the frequency of
   multiple paternity as an index of average sib relatedness within broods.
   As predicted, we find a significant positive association between the
   rate of multiple paternity within broods and nestling growth rates.
   Furthermore, this holds true when we control for the effects of
   variation in other factors that may be associated with variation in
   growth rate, such as body size, brood size, mating system and the form
   of parental care. We suggest, therefore, that variation in growth rate

Abstract = {{The response of Chaoborus to biomanipulation-induced changes in fish
   community structure was studied in two small south-central Ontario lakes
   which had similar physical and chemical characteristics. The
   biomanipulation involved: (a) three years (1991-1993) of
   pre-manipulation characterization of the food webs in two lakes with
   very different food web structures (Ranger Lake was dominated by
   piscivores and Mouse Lake had no piscivores), (b) removal of
   approximately 90 \% of the piscivores from Ranger Lake and their
   addition to Mouse Lake, and (c) three years (1994-1996) of
   post-manipulation characterization of the resulting changes in food web
   structure. The analysis presented here focuses on behavioural changes in
   Chaoborus, with specific reference to changes in Chaoborus density and
   migration patterns. At Ranger Lake, during both the pre- and
   post-manipulation phases of the experiment, the absolute density of
   Chaoborus (C. albatus, C, punctipennis, C. trivittatus and C, flavicans)
   varied little, remaining at or near 150 individuals m(-3). At Mouse
   Lake, densities were more than twice as high, and although inter-annual
   variability was also much higher, there were no significant pre- to
   post-manipulation changes in density, suggesting that changes in fish
   community structure had little direct influence on Chaoborus standing
   stocks. At Ranger Lake, diel migration patterns remained constant
   through the entire experimental period (1991-1996), but at Mouse Lake,
   there were clear changes in migratory behaviour. At Mouse Lake, during
   the pre-manipulation years (1991-1993), all four Chaoborus species
   migrated to the sediments during the day and ascended to the epilimnion
   at night. Post-manipulation, all four species remained in the water
   column during both the night and the day. Given that direct effects of
   fish on Chaoborus densities were not obvious, we suggest that changes in
   behaviour may have been mediated by the indirect effects of kairomones
   exuded by fish. Our data suggested that changes in Chaoborus migratory
   behaviour were non-linear and that the boundary in fish densities that
   elicited full diel migrations, lay between 700 and 2,400

Abstract = {{We report on the responses of wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus) to a reduction in predation risk from red foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) in a predator removal experiment in montane Australia.
   Specifically we tested whether rabbits in two sites with reduced fox
   numbers moved further from refuge than rabbits in two sites with
   abundant foxes. We then compared diet quality by analysing stomach
   contents, gut morphology and age-specific body mass to determine if
   release from predation risk enables rabbits to access higher quality
   food and hence attain higher body mass and condition.
   During spotlighting on three quarterly surveys in 1994-1995, rabbits in
   fox removal sites were observed, on average, three times further from
   refuge compared to rabbits at sites with foxes. However, this freedom to
   forage far from cover did not translate into a higher quality diet.
   Analysis of the nitrogen and neutral-detergent fibre content of stomach
   samples taken from a shot sample of rabbits at their peak densities
   after fox removal showed no differences in short-term diet quality of
   male or female rabbits due to fox removal. In contrast, analyses of gut
   morphologies, which reflect long-term fibre intake, suggested that
   rabbits in removal sites fed on a diet higher in fibre and hence of
   lower quality. This was possibly due to the large increases in rabbit
   density associated with fox removal. Despite this, male rabbits in fox
   removal sites were heavier for their age, had longer intestines, and
   heavier stomach and gut contents. We suggest that rabbits in fox removal
   sites compensated for the lower quality diet by increasing intake which
   enabled them to maintain higher age-specific body mass but only because
   predation risk was reduced. This result highlights the untenable link
   between resource limitation and predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how parental provisioning and nestling departure

   are reluctant provisioners and should be increasingly likely to
   terminate or reduce provisioning of their single nestling as it matures.
   For the nestling, remaining in the nest presents a risk of losing mass
   (if the parent does not provision) but also a possibility of additional
   provisioning. As the nestling matures and becomes increasingly capable
   of independence, the benefits of remaining in the nest decrease and
   nestlings should be increasingly likely to fledge. Nestlings also should
   be more likely to fledge when the expectation of additional provisioning
   is low. Data on parental provisioning (based on growth increments) and
   nestling departure were consistent with our hypothesis. Older and
   heavier nestlings had smaller growth increments than younger and lighter
   nestlings, suggesting that parents were reluctant to provision old and
   heavy nestlings. Older and heavier nestlings also were increasingly
   likely to fledge. We hypothesized that nestlings might use the intensity

Abstract = {{Using juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, we tested predictions
   arising from dynamic optimization models of foraging under predation
   risk. Coho juveniles from two size groups raised in the laboratory were
   individually fed varying food rations. Their willingness to risk
   Predation was measured as the time to resume foraging after presentation
   of a predator model. Small fish (mean weight 1.5 g) resumed feeding
   earlier than larger fish (3.5 g) as predicted by dynamic models under
   summer photoperiod but not under autumn photoperiod. Contrary to
   predictions, larger fish did not increase risk taking and small fish
   decreased risk taking between summer and autumn treatments. Food ration
   significantly influenced time to resume feeding only in small coho. A
   simple mechanistic model we proposed to explain feeding motivation under
   risk as a function of body size and prior growth rate was not sufficient
   to explain observed variation in risk taking. This study suggests that
   coho salmon use photoperiod and their own body size as cues for
   long-term, state-dependent adjustments of feeding behaviour. The lower
   risk taking of larger fish is probably an example of asset protection,
   whereby larger animals accept less predation risk to protect their
   greater accumulated fitness value. The decrease of risk taking in small

Abstract = {{We document and interpret microgeographic variation in life history
   traits of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain

   history stages (adults, embryos, and hatchlings), in costs of
   reproduction, and in reproductive frequencies. Remarkably, these
   differences all seem to result from a minor divergence in nest-site
   characteristics, Female water pythons use two main types of nest sites:
   those with relatively low, variable temperatures (especially hollows
   within paperbark root systems on the edge of the floodplain) and those
   with higher, constant temperatures (burrows dug by large varanid lizards
   in the higher, drier ridges similar to 2 km away). ``Cool{''} nests
   delayed reproduction and reduced survival rates of hatchlings in at
   least one year. Females ovipositing in ``cool{''} nests remained with
   the clutch throughout the 2-mo incubation period, whereas they deserted
   the clutch within a few days of laying in warmer nests. Most
   egg-attending females did not feed. Hence, ``cool{''}-nesting females
   were emaciated by the end of incubation, and many died from starvation
   or predation; surviving females required two years to replenish their
   energy reserves before producing another clutch. In contrast,
   ``hot{''}-nesting females had higher rates of survival, and most could
   reproduce again the following year. Most females showed strong nest-site
   fidelity in successive clutches, but some moved between ``hot{''} and
   ``cool{''} nest sites. We have previously shown that the incubation
   thermal regime also affects developmental rates and hatchling phenotypes
   (shape and behavior). Thus, nest-site selection is a phenotypically
   plastic character, which although superficially trivial, engenders
   significant microgeographic variation in a wide range of life history

   same habitat, or they may occur in different habitat patches; in the
   latter case, they cannot be encountered simultaneously. Unlike earlier
   analyses of these diet problems, here we consider the risk of mortality
   when foraging and allow risk to differ between habitats. Optimal time
   allocation strategies and the resultant functional responses are
   calculated for both one- and two-habitat situations. Mortality risk can
   substantially change the forager's time allocations and, consequently,
   its functional responses. Increasing mortality risk in both habitats
   proportionally can increase use of the habitat that has the greater
   risk. Time allocation often responds in a non-monotonic fashion to
   changes in the density of a particular food. As a result, functional
   responses may decrease with increasing food abundance over one or more
   ranges of abundance. Experimental findings on the response of
   grasshopper foraging to the risk of spider predation are compared with
   the theory. Finally, the possible indirect interactions between the food
   species in this simple food web are discussed.}},

   women with eating disorders had significantly lower birth weights and
   lengths than control children. There were no differences observed in
   childhood temperament or mothers' satisfaction with children's

   appears to be problematic from pregnancy through the toddler years and
   has various manifestations from low birth weight, to difficulties with
   breast feeding to detached and noninteractive mealtimes. Although these

Abstract = {{When novel behaviour patterns spread through animal populations,

Abstract = {{The wolf spider, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz), varies foraging patch
   residence time in the presence of different sensory cues from prey, even

   information to determine foraging patch sampling duration. In a series
   of two-chambered artificial foraging patches, I tested 26 S. ocreata
   once as immatures, and again as adults, under two hunger states
   (satiated and 7 days without food). Patches varied in the type of
   sensory information provided by live prey (crickets) as follows: visual
   cues alone; vibratory cues alone; combined visual/vibratory cues; and
   control (no prey). Without feeding in patches, the type of sensory
   stimuli available from prey strongly affected patch residence time, with
   spiders using primarily visual rather than vibratory cues. Hunger level
   as a main effect had no influence on residence time, but hunger state
   did mediate the importance of visual or vibratory information.
   Significant age- and sex-related differences in patch residence time in
   the presence of different sensory cues were found. These data suggest

   60\% of their time in vigilant or nest guarding behaviour during
   incubation. Parental roles were not defined as sharply during the

   young at only 54\% of the rate of females. Vigilance and nest watching
   were still primarily male duties. Male and female behaviour did not vary
   with the pair's combination of experience (e.g. experienced-experienced
   versus inexperienced-inexperienced in previous-current breeding season,
   respectively) during either phase of reproduction, but experienced males
   were more vigilant during incubation and fed young relatively more than
   inexperienced males. Experienced females were also more efficient
   foragers. Although behaviour did not differ among the four combinations
   of pair experience, inexperienced pairs none the less lost the most
   young to starvation and predation. Consequently, inexperienced pairs
   fledged one less nestling per nesting attempt than did pairs with at

   one experienced breeder substantially improved a pair's reproductive

   small fish, with fish decreasing their responses to food-deprivation
   treatments more strongly with increasing body length than to predation
   treatments. This may explain our observation that large fish emerged
   later from a refuge than small ones and spent shorter times outside the
   refuge. The key role of differential responses to food deprivation was
   further illustrated by the finding that the relative weight loss of

Abstract = {{The trophic role of ciliates in microbial food webs has often been
   considered to be either bacterivore, herbivore or predatory. In general,
   single species have been assigned to only one trophic level, although
   early publications have already pointed to omnivorous feeding in many
   different groups of ciliates. However, the knowledge on the quantitative
   aspects of ciliate food preferences is scarce up to now The aim of this
   study was to quantify food selectivity with the help of different
   fluorescently labeled potential prey organisms offered to the omnivorous
   filter-feeding ciliate Stylonychia mytilus as a model organism.
   Different fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) and algae (FLA), and
   inert fluorescent particles (FP) were offered in feeding experiments and
   evaluated with the help of epifluorescence microscopy. In addition,
   different live-stained fluorescent ciliates (FLCi) were offered as
   living prey. A vital staining method for obtaining FLCi is described.
   The results of this study showed a selective ingestion of different
   ciliates as well as a clear selection between different algae. Bacteria
   and FP were ingested, but negatively selected. There was a variability
   in the food preference regarding different-sized cells by Stylonychia
   mytilus indicating ontogenetic differences in feeding habits. Young
   daughter cells were not able to ingest the largest prey items. Feeding
   rates of Stylonychia were highest during the first twenty minutes of the
   experiments and reached a plateau after 60 min. Capture efficiency for
   ciliate prey was 70\% at the beginning and declined to a value of about
   30\% after 30 min. Such behavioural patterns may significantly
   overestimate feeding rates of ciliates determined by short-term
   experiments. Food concentration was shown to have strong effects on
   ciliate ingestion rates leading to a clearly detectable functional
   response. Various factors influencing the feeding behaviour of
   filter-feeding ciliates and their significance in grazing experiments
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the Kruger National Park, male lions, Panthera lee, acquire most of
   their food by hunting rather than scavenging. This study, the most
   intensive to date of male lion ecology, showed that in savanna
   woodlands, with high buffalo, Syncerus caffer, densities, male lions
   were frequent and successful hunters. The main prey species of all male
   group types, but particularly nonterritorial males, was buffalo: By
   contrast, females preyed more frequently on the most abundant
   medium-sized ungulates, such as wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and
   zebra, Equus burchelli. Thus intraspecific prey selection separation was
   based primarily on intersexual and, to a lesser extent, social
   differences. Furthermore, both nonterritorial males and pride females
   located their favoured prey, buffalo and medium-sized ungulates,
   respectively, more often than other prey. We investigated the influence
   of several ecological variables on the socioecology of male lions,
   particularly as we had determined that territorial males spent little
   time with their pride females and tended to hunt by themselves in their
   respective male coalitions. Further analysis showed that in a range of
   ecosystems in southern and eastern Africa the proportion of time
   territorial males spent with, and thus scavenged from, their pride
   females was strongly influenced by vegetation structure, and therefore
   probably by the assemblage of available ungulates. In open systems,
   territorial males were, therefore, likely to be encountered with pride
   females, whereas in more wooded areas they were likely to be encountered
   away from their pride females. We suggest that this is because
   vegetation structure influences food/prey availability and hunting
   success and influences territory maintenance and/or cub defence. (C)

Abstract = {{Several novel cyclic MSH analogs were synthesized, and their binding

   substance (HS024) that showed about 20-fold selectivity and very high
   affinity (K-i = 0.29 nM) for the MC4 receptor. HS024 (cyclic
   {[}AcCys(3),Nle(4),Arg(5),D-Nal(7),Cys-NH211] alpha-MSH-(3-11)) has a
   29-membered atom ring structure that includes an Arg in position 5.
   HS024 was found to antagonize an alpha MSH-induced cAMP response in
   cells expressing the human MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5 receptor DNAs. HS024
   also caused a dose-dependent increase in food intake, with a maximum
   response (4-fold increase) at a l-nmol dose injected
   intracerebroventricularly in free feeding rats. We also tested SHU9119,
   a previously described nonselective MC receptor antagonist, and found
   HS024 and SHU9119 to have similar potencies for increasing food intake,
   although SHU9119 appeared to induce more serious side-Effects. HS024
   increased the food intake of free feeding rats to levels comparable to
   those in food-deprived rats, indicating that blockade of the MC4
   receptor is a highly effective way to increase feeding. Moreover, we
   tested the effects of intracerebroventricular injections of HS024 in
   elevated plus-maze and open-field experiments on rats. In these tests,
   HS024 did not appear to affect emotionality or locomotor activity,
   suggesting that the MC4 receptor does not mediate the anxiogenic-like

Abstract = {{Avian long-distance migration involves the storage and expenditure of
   very large fuel loads. Birds may double in weight before take-off on
   flights of many 1000 km, and they may lose half their body mass over the
   subsequent few days that such trips take. Recent studies indicate that
   in addition to the storage and depletion of fat, the muscles and belly
   organs also undergo considerable changes in size in the course of such
   migrations. Such intraindividual and repeatedly reversed changes in
   stores and organ sizes represent a class of phenotypic plasticity called
   `phenotypic flexibility'. Using preliminary comparative data for
   different populations of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica, and
   several other shorebird species adding variation to the migration
   strategies sampled (Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Ruff Philomachus
   pugnax, Red Knot Calidris canutus and Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius
   tahitiensis), the thesis is developed that the size of the organs
   carried during take-off represent evolutionary compromises between their
   functions during the storage, flight and post-arrival phases of
   migration. In all cases fat-free tissue along with fat is deposited
   during fuel storage, but the proportions vary a great deal between
   similarly sized species. Just before departure on long-distance flights,
   exercise organs (pectoral muscle and heart) tend to show hypertrophy and
   nutritional organs (stomach, intestine and liver) tend to show atrophy.
   Reductions in nutritional organs appear most pronounced in (sub-)
   species that are about to overfly barren oceans with few or no
   opportunities for emergency landings. Migrant birds seem to show a great
   deal of adaptive flexibility, and the study of this flexibility may shed
   light on (presently unknown) physiological mechanisms as well as on
   correlated ecological constraints on bird migration.}},

Abstract = {{Life history characteristics of sea urchins can be used to evaluate the
   potential of species for aquaculture. The important life history
   characteristics for this evaluation can be separated into those
   affecting production of biomass and maintenance. These result from three
   primary life history strategies. First, species in environments that are
   unstable or with high predation and with high food availability should
   have high production and low maintenance. Second, high production and
   moderate maintenance and a potential for phenotypic plasticity should
   occur in species in environments that are stable with low predation and
   high food availability. Third, those in environments that are stable or
   with low predation and with low food availability should have low
   production and high maintenance. Tripneustes, Strongylocentrotus, and
   Arbacia are probable representative genera, respectively, of these life
   history strategies. Species in the first category would be most
   appropriate for aquaculture using production as the criterion. The
   consumption by humans of certain species of sea urchins in the past can
   be related to their accessibility and palatability, and does not
   necessarily indicate their suitability for aquaculture. Knowledge of

Abstract = {{n-Butyl acetate, a common industrial solvent, was selected by the US EPA
   as a chemical of concern for neurotoxicity as part of the Multisubstance
   Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic potential of
   n-butyl acetate was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats using a
   functional observational battery, motor activity, neurohistopathology,
   and schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB) as indicators of
   neurotoxicity. Animals were exposed to concentrations of 0, 500, 1500,
   or 3000 ppm of n-butyl acetate for 6 hours per day for 65 exposures over
   14 weeks. Functional observational battery and motor activity values for
   ad libitum-fed male and female rats were measured during Weeks -1, 4, 8,
   and 13. SCOB testing of food-restricted animals, using a multiple fixed
   ratio/fixed interval schedule, was conducted daily prior to each
   exposure to maintain the operant behavior; the data from Weeks -1, 4, 8,
   and 13 were evaluated for evidence of neurotoxicity. Transient signs of
   sedation and hypoactivity were observed only during exposure to the 1500
   and 3000 ppm concentrations. The only signs of systemic toxicity were
   reduced body weights for the 3000 ppm ad libitum-fed groups and
   occasionally for the female 1500 ppm ad libitum-fed group. No evidence
   of neurotoxicity was seen during the functional observational battery
   examinations. Motor activity for the 3000 ppm male group was
   significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) higher than for the control
   group only during Week 4. No significant differences were observed among
   groups for Weeks 8 and 13. No significant differences in motor activity
   values were observed for female rats. No significant differences were
   seen in operant behavior at any test vapor concentration. Microscopic
   evaluations of sections from the brain, spinal cord (cervical and lumbar
   regions), dorsal and ventral spinal roots, dorsal root ganglia, sciatic
   nerve, and tibial nerve of animals in the control and 3000 ppm groups
   did not indicate any treatment-related effects. ln conclusion, there was
   no evidence of cumulative neurotoxicity based on the functional
   observational battery, motor activity, neurohistopathology, and
   schedule-controlled operant behavior endpoints. The data presented here
   are relevant to the neurotoxicity risk assessment of n-butanol due to
   the rapid hydrolysis of n-butyl acetate in vivo. (C) 1998 Intox Press,

Abstract = {{A herbivore faces challenges while foraging-ongoing changes in its
   physiological condition along with variation in the nutrient and toxin
   concentrations of foods, spatially and temporally-that make selecting a
   nutritious diet a vital affair. Foraging behaviours arise from simple
   rules that operate across levels of resolution from cells and organs to
   individuals and their interactions with social and physical
   environments. At all these levels, behaviour is a function of its
   consequences: a behaviour operating on the environment to induce changes
   is itself changed by those events. Thus, behaviour emerges from its own
   functioning-behaviour self-organizes-not from that of its surroundings.
   This ostensible autonomy notwithstanding, no self-organizing system
   (cell, organ, or individual) is independent of its environs because
   existence consists of an ongoing exchange of energy and matter.
   According to this view, the notion of cause and effect is replaced with
   functional relationships between behaviours and environmental
   consequences. Changes in physical environments alter the distribution,
   abundance, nutritional, and toxicological characteristics of plants,
   which affect food preference. Social interactions early in life
   influence behaviour in various ways: animals prefer familiar foods and
   environments, and they prefer to be with companions. Animals in
   unfamiliar environments often walk farther, ingest less food, and suffer
   more from malnutrition and toxicity than animals in familiar
   environments. An individual's food preferences-and its ability to
   discriminate familiar from novel foods-arise from the functional
   integration of sensory (smell, taste, texture) and postingestive
   (effects of nutrients and toxins on chemo-, osmo-, and
   mechano-receptors) effects. The ability to discriminate among foods is
   critical for survival: all problems with poisonous plants are due to an
   inability to discriminate or a lack of alternatives. Animals eat a
   variety of foods as a result of nearing or exceeding tolerance limits
   for sensory and postingestive effects unique to each food. After eating
   any food too frequently or excessively, the likelihood increases that
   animals will eat alternative foods owing to exceeding sensory-,
   nutrient-, and toxin-specific tolerance limits. Cyclic patterns of
   intake of a variety of foods reflect seemingly chaotic interactions
   among flavours, nutrients, and toxins interacting along continua.}},

Abstract = {{Infanticide, the killing of conspecific young, has been documented in
   numerous species of mammals and is considered an adaptive behavioral
   strategy to enhance the reproductive success of the perpetrator. The
   potential benefits of committing infanticide for males are obtaining
   nutritional gain and mating partners, and for females are acquiring
   access to resources such as food and nest sites. Some costs are
   associated with committing infanticide such as additional energy
   expenditure, risk of injury, and exposure to predation. However, the
   major costs associated with infanticide are borne by the victim Female
   and the sire male in loss of fitness. In response to this selection,
   males and females use a variety of counter-strategies to protect their
   young from infanticide.
   We summarize the published accounts and theory associated with
   infanticide and the occurrence of counter-strategies in a variety of
   mammalian groups in order to explain how infanticide may influence
   individual behavior as well as the social systems of mammals. We focus
   on the behavioral strategies used, primarily by females, to deter major
   losses in reproductive success. These strategies include aggression,
   female choice of dominant males, and promiscuity to confuse paternity as
   defense against males, and territoriality, association with kin,
   reproductive suppression, and reproductive synchrony as defenses against
   females. Male counter-strategies are less well known, but intrasexual
   territoriality may in part function as defense against infanticide. The
   costs associated with the different male and female counter-strategies
   are likely to vary, but may include increased energy expenditure,
   exposure to predators and injury for both sexes, as well as increased
   competition for resources, limited mate choice, and postponed
   reproduction for females. We propose that the occurrence of infanticide
   does not only have the potential to affect the behavior of individuals
   (e.g. aggression. spacing and mate choice), but may also have
   consequences for the shaping of mammalian mating systems.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting an `optimal' nest site is believed to be an important
   component of fitness for birds, but paradoxically there is often
   considerable intraspecific variation in nest sites. Few Studies have
   tested whether nest-site selection by birds changes after experience
   with nest predators. Using data collected over 9 years, we examined
   within- and between-year variation in 331 nests of white-tailed
   ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus. We found the first direct evidence for a
   fitness trade-off with amount of cover at the nest; concealed sites were
   less often detected by predators but were more risky for incubating
   hens. Small ptarmigan and those in good body condition used sites with
   less cover, while large ptarmigan nested at higher elevations. Nesting
   success was not related to age or spring body condition. Responses to
   experience with predators were less clear. Successful females tended to
   use less cover the following year, whereas unsuccessful females tended
   to change cover types, but not the amount of cover, in subsequent years.
   Overall, characteristics of nest sites showed strong seasonal patterns,

Abstract = {{Optimal foraging theory predicts that an individual should resort to
   intraspecific kleptoparasitism when this foraging strategy helps to
   maximize its intake rate. Thus aggressor and victim should be foraging
   at lower and higher rates, respectively, than the flock average (intake
   rate maximization). Independent of the maximization principle, moreover,
   an aggressor should attack when its intake rate falls below a threshold
   critical for survival, and select a victim foraging at an intake rate
   high enough to ensure survival (starvation risk minimization). We tested
   both hypotheses using 324 aggressive displacements from feeding sites
   observed in flocks of common cranes, Gills grus, foraging on cereal
   fields. Aggressors attacked cranes feeding at higher rates than average
   birds. The immediate consequences of a successful attack were an
   increase in intake rate for the aggressor and a decrease for the victim.
   The intake rate of the aggressor prior to the attack was lower than both
   the mean intake rate of the flock and the minimum intake rate necessary
   to cover basic metabolic needs. After displacing its victim, the intake
   rate of the aggressor was higher than before the attack and also higher
   than the average intake rate of the flock. The intake rate of the
   aggressor after the attack was not higher than the mean intake rate of
   the flock, however, when the time spent on the attack was included. We
   conclude that cranes used a kleptoparasitic strategy to recover from
   temporary reductions in feeding rate. This was particularly the case

Abstract = {{In the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps (Pisces, Gobiidae), males
   build nests under mussel shells where they care for the eggs until

   of their eggs than males fed with both mussel meat in excess and goby
   eggs. This may suggest that male common gobies cannibalize their eggs to
   obtain energy rather than essential nutrients lacking in other diets.
   Moreover, males ate their whole clutch if it was exceptionally small
   regardless of food treatment, suggesting that males stop investing in
   their clutch if its reproductive value is less;than the cost of guarding
   it. Thus, whole clutch cannibalism and partial clutch cannibalism seem
   to be governed by different factors. Furthermore, poorly built nests
   were associated with starved males, suggesting that nest concealing is
   costly. There was an association between how well the nest was built and
   partial clutch filial cannibalism, suggesting that the appearance of the

Abstract = {{In hedonic theories of motivation, `motivational affective states'

   behaviour, especially in situations where a flexible or learned response
   is more adaptive than a rigid or reflexive one. MASs can be negative leg
   unpleasant feelings of hunger or pain) or positive (eg pleasant feelings
   associated with eating and playing). Hedonic theories often portray
   negative and positive MASs as opposite ends of a one-dimensional scale.
   We suggest that natural selection has favoured negative and positive
   affect as separate processes to solve two different types of
   motivational problems. We propose that negative MASs leg thirst, fear)
   evolved in response to `need situations' where the fitness benefit of an

   threat to survival or reproductive success. We propose that these

   creates the need for action, and that negative MASs can become intense
   and prolonged if the threat to fitness is high and persistent. We
   propose that positive MASs evolved in `opportunity situations' where an
   action (eg playing, exploring) has become advantageous because the
   fitness cost of performing it has declined. We propose that these
   positive MASs occur during, or as a result of the performance of types
   of behaviour which are beneficial for fitness at a variety of times, not
   only when they are required to meet immediate needs; and that the
   pleasure inherent in the behaviour motivates the animal to perform it
   when the cost of so doing is sufficiently low. Some behaviour leg
   eating) can be motivated by both positive and negative affect. Other
   behaviour, such as playing or fleeing from a predator, may be motivated
   largely by positive or negative affect alone. Our hypothesis needs to be
   tested, but we suggest that it corresponds well to common human
   experience.
   The hypothesis provides a basis for predicting whether an aspect of
   animal management is likely to cause strong and prolonged negative
   affect ('suffering', or to prevent animals from experiencing certain
   types of pleasure. This distinction is important for bringing animal
   welfare assessment into line with ethical concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the first discovered gastrointestinal
   hormones and one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain. Two
   types of CCK receptors have been identified: (1) CCK-A receptors are
   mainly located in the periphery, but are also found in some areas of the
   CNS; and (2) CCK-B receptors are widely distributed in the brain. Major
   biological actions of CCK are the reduction of food intake and the
   induction of anxiety-related behavior. Inhibition of feeding is mainly
   mediated by the A-type receptors, whereas anxiety-like behavior is
   induced by stimulating B type receptors. This paper presents new
   findings on the effects of the biologically active CCK agonists, CCK-8S,
   CCK-I, and A71378. The results reviewed suggest that the hypophagic
   effects of CCK are strongly dependent on the experimental design, sex,
   and age of the rats. For example, food intake measured during the night
   or after food deprivation is reduced by CCK-8S in young adult and aged
   rats, whereas, under fixed feeding conditions, CCK-8S does not inhibit
   food intake in young adult rats. The sensitivity to the hypophagic CCK
   effect increases with age in male and female rats; however, female rats
   are less sensitive to the CCK action. Further, using a nongenetic and
   non-stressful model of obesity due to unspecific postnatal overfeeding,
   the satiating effect of moderate CCK-8S doses is weaker in obese than in
   normal rats. Again, the hypophagic effect is more pronounced in male
   than in female obese and normal rats. Considering that aversive
   reactions in rats are markedly influenced by strain and breeding-line
   variations, research results in this area are critically reviewed. It is
   shown that anxiety-like symptoms can only be induced by a selectively
   acting CCK-B agonist, whereas mixed CCK-A and -B agonists and selective
   CCK-A agonists fail to change behavior in anxiety tests. CCK-4 induces
   stable and reproducible anxiogenic-like behavior only in certain rat
   strains. Moreover, CCK-4 effects can be demonstrated in the conflict
   test, in the ultrasonic vocalization test in rat pups, on the elevated
   plus maze, and in the black and white box, but not in the social
   interaction test. CCK has also been reported to modulate memory
   processes. On the one hand, CCK-8S and CCK-4 enhanced habituation to the
   novelty of a hole board. On the other hand, repeated administration of
   CCK-8S did not improve maze performance in aged rats. The literature on
   the behavioral pharmacology of CCK is rife with inconsistency and
   contradiction. The major biological actions of CCK depend on the
   receptor selectivity of the CCK fragments used and on organismic and
   procedural variables. All these variables potentially influence
   behavioral responses in rats. Therefore, in CCK research more attention
   should be paid to the importance of these methodological factors.}},

   daily, more than three days weekly for no apparent reasons. The question
   is whether/in what way daily routines of infants concerned differ from
   normal, infants. Mothers of colicky infants (n =25) and mothers in a
   control group (n=25) record characteristics of the mother/child
   relationship, their assumptions why the child is screaming, care and
   attention they provide and babies' reactions. For seven days the mothers
   kept a diary about the babies' behaviour and worked on questionnaires
   concerning social support received, depressant effects and exhaustion.
   Interviews about the extent of care provided as well as personal
   thoughts and emotions were conducted. The ``colic group{''} formed two
   subgroups: one fulfilling Wessels criteria (Wessel-Koliker; WK), the
   other more conforming with the ``control group{''} babies though mothers
   complained about screaming (Non-Wessel-Koliker; NWK). ``Colic
   group{''}-babies received more attention and care (compared to the
   ``control group{''} babies), attempts to calm them down frequently
   failed and mothers in this group reacted less promptly to their babies'
   screaming. ``NWK-group{''}-mothers strongly lend to attribute the

Abstract = {{Foraging adaptations include behavioral and physiological responses, but
   most optimal foraging models deal exclusively with behavioral decision
   variables, taking other dimensions as constraints. To overcome this
   limitation, we measured behavioral and physiological responses of
   European starlings Sturnus vulgaris to changes in food availability in a
   laboratory environment. The birds lived in a dosed economy with a choice
   of two foraging modes (flying and walking) and were observed under two
   treatments (hard and easy) that differed in the work required to obtain
   food. Comparing the hard with the easy treatment, we found the following
   differences. In the hard treatment, daily amount of work was higher, but
   daily intake was lower. Even though work was greater, total daily
   expenditure was smaller, partly because overnight metabolism was lower.
   Body mass was lower, but daily oscillation in body mass did not differ.
   Feces' caloric density was lower; indicating greater food utilization.
   Energy expenditure rate expressed as multiples of basal metabolic rate
   (BMR) increased during the working period from 3.5 X BMR (easy) to 5.2 X
   BMR (hard), but over the 24-h period, it was close to 2.4 X BMR in both
   treatments. We also found that rate of expenditure during flight was
   very high in both treatments (52.3 W in easy and 45.5 W in hard), as
   expected for short (as opposed to cruising) flights. The relative
   preferences between walking and flying were incompatible with maximizing
   the ratio of energy gains per unit of expenditure (efficiency) but
   compatible with maximizing net gain per unit of time during the foraging
   cycle (net rate). Neither currency explained the results when
   nonforaging time was included. Time was not a direct constraint: the
   birds rested more than 90\% of the time in both treatments.
   Understanding this complex picture requires reasoning with ecological,
   physiological, and cognitive arguments. We defend the role of optimality

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity has primarily been studied in the context of
   adaptation to environmental fluctuations and its underlying genetic
   mechanisms. However, its impact on competition and coexistence has
   rarely been addressed. In this paper we analyzed the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of phenotypic plasticity in diel vertical
   migration of competing, physiologically distinguishable, Daphnia
   populations. We developed a model that evaluates the competitive
   strength of daphnids which are food limited and which face predation.
   Competitive strength is assessed by a population's ability to invade and
   defend a previously established site. Phenotypically plastic individuals
   were assumed to choose an evolutionarily stable migration strategy at
   any time during the invasion process. We found plasticity to increase a
   population's competitive ability and in special cases to support
   coexistence of similar populations. Including community structure in
   analyzing the adaptive Value of phenotypic plasticity reveals aspects
   that are not directly inferable from isolated population models. Hence,
   selection for plasticity may be more widespread than generally expected.}},

Abstract = {{Alimentary restraint, cognitive variable related to eating behavior and
   obesity, is reportedly a valuable predictor for the development of
   therapeutic strategies. This paper addresses the relationship between
   maternal restraint and several psychological variables in their
   daughters (alexithymia, neuroticism, extraversion). From the study of 35
   mother-daughter dyads it can be concluded that daughters of highly
   restrained mothers tend to present high scores in the Restraint scale of
   the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire of Stunkard and Messsick,
   translated into Spanish and validated as Cuestionario de Conducta
   Alimentaria. Daughters of highle restrained mothers present also higher
   scores in the Neuroticism scale of the revised version of the Eysenck
   Personality Questionnaire. Daughters of mothers with low Restraint
   scores are in average higher than those of their mothers, although lower
   than those belonging to daughters of highle restrained mothers. Previous
   observations on the positive correlation between Disinhibition and
   Hunger of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire are confirmed. These

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Background: Approximately 39\% of children aged <5 y in developing
   countries are growth retarded (stunted) and many have poor mental
   development and behavioral abnormalities. Animal research suggests that
   an altered stress response may contribute to the negative outcomes
   following undernutrition.
   Objective: We tested the hypothesis that stunted children have higher
   salivary cortisol concentrations and heart rates and altered behavior
   when compared with nonstunted children when social background was
   controlled for.
   Design: We compared 30 stunted with 24 nonstunted children, all of whom
   were 8-10 y old and lived in the same poor areas of Kingston, Jamaica.
   All subjects were participants in a prospective, longitudinal,
   case-control study of children who were stunted in early childhood. We
   administered a test session (including psychologic and physical
   stressors), measured baseline and response levels of salivary cortisol
   and heart rate, and observed behavior.
   Results: Compared with nonstunted children, stunted children had higher
   salivary cortisol concentrations (P = 0.007), had higher heart rates
   during the psychologic test session (P = 0.03), exhibited enhanced
   cardiovascular responsivity to a physical stressor (P = 0.04), vocalized
   less, were more inhibited, and were less attentive. After birth weight
   or social background and maternal and child intelligence quotients were
   controlled for, the differences in cortisol concentration and
   cardiovascular reactivity remained significant.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that consistent growth retardation
   since early childhood affects physiologic arousal, which, we speculate,
   may contribute to the poor cognitive functioning and immune responses of
   stunted children and the relation between adult short stature and
   increased cardiovascular risk.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have normally considered weaning to be a non-reversible
   event. To determine the validity of this assumption, we interviewed 36
   mothers of toddlers who were living in a poor shanty town of Lima, Peru.
   Data from 32 women were complete and used in this analysis. Mothers
   described their beliefs, practices, and decisions about breastfeeding,
   weaning, and relactation (the reintroduction of breastfeeding after
   weaning). We recorded attempted weaning events if the mother reported
   (1) purposefully not breastfeeding with the intention to wean, or (2)
   carrying out an action that was believed to cause the child to stop
   breastfeeding. Using a constant comparative approach, references to
   child-feeding decisions were coded, categorized, and analyzed. All
   mothers breastfed for at least 12 months; the median duration of
   breastfeeding was 25 months. There were several different patterns of
   child-feeding. Thirteen women never attempted to wean their children or
   had weaned on the first attempt. The majority (n = 19) of women,
   however, attempted to wean their children - some as early as 3 months of
   age - but relactated between less than 1 day and 3 months later. Factors
   that influenced feeding decisions were primarily related to maternal and
   child health, and maternal time commitments. Children were weaned when
   there was a perceived problem of maternal health or time commitments and
   child health was not at risk of deterioration. Mothers postponed weaning
   because of poor child health. The primary reason for relactation was a
   child's negative reaction to weaning (e.g., incessant crying or refusal
   to eat). Personalities of the mother and child were important
   determinants of feeding decisions. These results demonstrate that
   maternal and child factors jointly influence child-feeding decisions and
   that these decisions are easily reversed. As relactation is.culturally
   acceptable, health practitioners should consider recommending
   relactation when children have been prematurely weaned and human milk
   would improve their nutritional and health status. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{265-274}},

Abstract = {{The development and occurrence of anorexia, the voluntary reduction in
   food intake during parasitic infections in animals, is somewhat
   paradoxical and contrary to conventional wisdom and expectation. We take
   the view that its occurrence is an evolved, costly behavioural
   adaptation which serves a function. Five such functional and general
   hypotheses to account for it are developed: (1) anorexia is induced by
   the parasite for its own benefit; (2) food intake decreases to starve
   parasites; (3) the negative effect on the host's energetic efficiency
   during parasitic diseases has a direct effect on food consumption; (4)
   food intake decreases for the purpose of promoting an effective immune
   response in the host; and (5) anorexia allows the host to become more
   selective in its diet, and thus select foods that either minimize the
   risk of infection or are high in antiparasitic compounds. Only
   hypotheses (4) and (5) survive the comparison for consistency with the
   physiological, metabolic and behavioural alterations that occur during
   the development of parasitic infections, and with the rule of generality
   (i.e. account for its occurrence in both protozoan and helminth
   infections). Both surviving hypotheses will need further experimental
   testing for their support or rejection, and such experiments are
   proposed. Also, the advantages and consequences of viewing anorexia
   during parasitic infections within a functional framework are discussed.
   These arise from the recognition that anorexia is a disease-coping
   strategy, part of the mechanism of recognition of parasite invasion by
   the immune system, which leads to a modification of the host's feeding
   behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In the Dutch Hunger Winter at the end of World War II a combination of
   circumstances created the conditions of a natural experiment. Unlike
   other famines, the Dutch famine struck at a precisely circumscribed time
   and place, and in a society able to document the timing and severity of
   the nutritional deprivation as well as the effects on fertility and
   health. Because the Dutch maintained comprehensive military and health
   records, it was possible to compare the incidence of neurodevelopmental
   disorders in adulthood for birth cohorts exposed versus those unexposed
   to prenatal famine. We have conducted several studies guided by the
   hypothesis that prenatal micronutrient deficiencies can cause
   neurodevelopmental schizophrenia or related personality disorders. In
   this paper we shall summarize our previous work and combine the outcome
   data of the different studies. Early prenatal famine was found to be
   specifically and robustly associated with each of three conditions: (1)
   congenital anomalies of the central nervous system, (2) schizophrenia,
   and (3) schizophrenia spectrum personality disorders. We found that the
   greatest increase in the risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorder -
   schizophrenia plus spectrum personality disorder - occurred among males
   born in the famine cities in December 1945 (relative risk = 2.7; 95\%
   confidence interval = 1.5-5.1). Persons born in December 1945 were
   generally conceived at the absolute peak of the famine (March-April

Abstract = {{Fat reserves are an important energy source for animals wintering in
   temperate zones. Long nights, low ambient temperature and often
   unpredictable food all increase the probability of death from
   starvation, and to survive, animals carry energy reserves as fat. Based
   on the assumption that extra weight makes birds more vulnerable to
   diurnal predators, it has been hypothesized that predation risk places
   an upper limit on avian fat reserves. The hypothesis leads to the
   prediction that birds should decrease their mass in response to
   increased risk of predation. We tested this prediction with a resident
   species, the tufted titmouse, Baelophus bicolor. During a 3-day period,
   we presented a taxidermic mount of a sharp-shinned hawk, Accipiter
   striatus (predator treatment) or a mourning dove, Zenaida macroura
   (control treatment) to seven titmice housed individually with food ad
   libitum. Even though vigilance and delay in time to resume foraging were
   significantly higher after exposure to the hawk model, the body mass of
   titmice after exposure to the hawk increased rather than decreased, a
   result opposite to that predicted. In particular, the birds
   significantly increased their evening body mass and mean daily mass gain
   during the treatment period. Our results suggest that risk-dependent
   foraging appears to regulate avian body fat reserves by limiting
   foraging time. When food is unlimited, as in our experiment, birds may
   be able to obtain high energy reserves even while maintaining intense
   vigilance for predators, and under such conditions, the energetic costs
   of flying may control upper level energy reserves. (C) 1998 The

Abstract = {{Like many sexually dimorphic ungulates, bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis,
   form sexually segregated groups. Nursery groups include females, lambs
   and subadult males, while adult males form bachelor groups. Previous
   hypotheses to account for sexual segregation in ungulates have suggested
   sexual differences in energy requirements, predation risk and social
   preferences. I tested the hypothesis that differing nutritional demands,
   due to sexual dimorphism in body size, would lead to different movement
   patterns and time budgets. If ruminating/foraging schedules differed
   according to body size, males and females could not synchronize their
   activities and therefore would segregate by sex. To test this
   hypothesis, I observed a population of marked bighorns. I recorded the
   time males and females spent lying, grazing or walking during 8-14 h of
   focal-animal observations. Initial and final location of groups and
   steps taken per minute foraging were also noted. Females spent more time
   foraging and walking and had longer foraging and walking bouts than
   adult males, but did not differ in numbers of steps taken while
   foraging. Males spent more time lying than females. Subadult males
   switched between nursery and bachelor groups and changed their foraging
   behaviour depending on the type of group they were in. The distance
   moved was on average almost four times greater for female than for male
   groups. I suggest that sexual difference in time budgets and movement
   patterns make it difficult for males and females to stay in the
   same,group and therefore lead to sexual segregation. (C) 1998 The

Abstract = {{Preferences of fish for different types of shoals may influence the

   factors influencing the preferences of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, for
   different shoals in order to shed some light on how information
   transmission occurs. Adult subjects were given a choice between swimming
   with two diverging shoals of conspecifics that differed with respect to
   key characteristics. In six choice experiments, subjects discriminated
   between shoal partners on the basis of: (1) shoal size, subjects
   preferring a shoal of 10 to a single fish; (2) size of shoaling fish,
   small fish preferring small conspecifics rather than an equal number of
   large fish, while large fish showed no preference; (3) local foraging
   experience of shoaling fish, shoals containing fish that had previously
   been repeatedly fed in the experimental tank being preferred to shoals
   with no such experience; and (4) familiarity of shoaling fish, guppies
   preferring familiar rather than unfamiliar conspecifics. No
   discrimination on the basis of colour or hunger was observed. In
   addition, following a shoal to a food site on just three trials allowed
   guppies to learn a route, or food site, preference. Guppies were
   considerably more likely to learn to adopt the behaviour shown by
   members of a shoal of several demonstrators than an alternative
   behaviour shown by a single conspecific demonstrator. The relationship
   between preferences for different shoals and the social transmission of
   information is discussed in the light of these findings. The results
   suggest that shoaling preferences may strongly influence-the social
   transmission of novel foraging information or feeding preferences
   through fish populations, and imply that learned information may diffuse

   in home range size and patchiness of spatial use as hare densities
   peaked and declined, although this was better explained by smaller
   territory sizes due to a growing owl population rather than a direct
   behavioral response to changing food density. Experimental owls on
   food-enriched territories did not show a difference in conventional
   measurements of home-range size and patchiness of spatial use
   compared,vith controls, but the distances of owl locations to treatment
   blocks revealed concentrations of spatial use on experimental hot spots.
   At a larger scale, neither territorial owls nor nonterritorial floaters
   showed a tendency to leave poorer patches and move toward hot spots, and
   the territorial system of Great Horned Owls was largely resistant to
   extreme variations in prey density. The effect of social interference
   between predators has been assumed for several models of predator-prey
   interactions, but empirical evidence has rarely been demonstrated. Our
   results suggest that territorial behavior, in addition to limiting the
   growth of a predator population, also prevents large aggregations of
   predators at an intermediate spatial scale.}},

Abstract = {{We present a model of the survival-maximizing foraging behavior of an
   animal searching in patches for hidden prey with a clumped distribution.
   We assume the forager to be Bayesian: it updates its statistical
   estimate of prey number in the current patch while foraging. When it
   arrives at the patch, it has an expectation of the patch's quality,
   which equals the average patch quality in the environment. While
   foraging, the forager uses its information about the time spent
   searching in the patch and how many prey has been caught during this
   time. It can estimate both the instantaneous intake rate and the
   potential intake rate during the rest of the patch visit. When prey
   distribution is clumped, potential intake rate may increase with time
   spent in the patch if prey is caught in the near future. Being optimal,
   a Bayesian forager should therefore base its patch-leaving decision on
   the estimated potential patch value, not on the instantaneous patch
   value. When patch value is measured in survival rate and mortality may
   occur either as starvation or predation, the patch should be abandoned
   when the forager estimates that its potential survival rate during the
   rest of the patch visit equals the long term survival rate in the
   environment. This means that the instantaneous intake rate, when the
   patch is left, is not constant but is an increasing function of
   searching time in the patch. Therefore, the giving-up densities of prey
   in the patches will also be higher the longer the search times. The
   giving-up densities are therefore expected to be an increasing, but
   humped, function of initial prey densities. These are properties of
   Bayesian foraging behavior not included in previous empirical studies
   and model tests.}},

Abstract = {{We examined predictors of outcome 1 year after completion of a

   DSM-III-R criteria for BN, and who completed the clinical trial, were
   available for follow-up at 1 year. Predictor variables were assessed
   prospectively and partitioned temporally to reflect lifetime history
   (including personality), pretreatment clinical status, and posttreatment
   clinical status. Outcome was based on the frequency of binging and
   purging in the 3 months before assessment based on carefully constructed
   lifechart interviews. A series of stepwise logistic regressions were
   performed to determine independent predictors of 1-year outcome while
   controlling for treatment received. Demographic variables were unrelated
   to treatment outcome. A history of obesity was predictive of poor
   outcome, whereas a history of alcohol dependence decreased the odds of
   poor outcome, High self-directedness on the Temperament and Character
   Inventory (TCI) predicted favorable outcome at 1 year, whereas
   personality disorder symptoms were not predictive. Pretreatment global
   functioning, bulimia scores on the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), and
   the presence of major depression predicted poor outcome. Posttreatment
   binging, food restriction, and urges to binge on a cue reactivity
   assessment predicted poor outcome at 1 year. The character trait of
   self-directedness is a strong predictor of good outcome for CBT, and
   methods to enhance this trait may be worthy of investigation. Low global

   require additional treatment than focused CBT for BN. Our results argue
   for treatment goals that include abstinence from binging and restricting

Abstract = {{We investigated determinants of territory size in White-winged
   Trumpeters (Psophia leucoptera), frugivorous, cooperatively breeding
   birds that defend large, permanent, all-purpose territories in lowland
   Amazonian rain forest. During a 7-mo period, we measured changes in food
   density at a site in Manu National Park, Peru, and conducted full-day
   focal samples on individuals that allowed us to record daily food intake
   of territorial birds. We used data from laboratory analyses on energy
   content of fruit species eaten by trumpeters to calculate a phenology of
   energy content for food available on territories of focal groups, and to
   calculate daily energy intake of focal trumpeters. Additionally, we used
   lab measurements of basal metabolic rate of trumpeters to estimate daily
   energy requirements of wild trumpeters.
   Both census and focal sample data suggested that food availability on
   trumpeter territories varied widely, sometimes greatly exceeding and
   sometimes falling short of the amount that we calculated was necessary
   to meet average daily energy requirements of groups. To determine
   whether trumpeter territory size was related to food density, we
   conducted fruit removals. Every day, we removed an amount of fruit from
   the territory that was equivalent to the amount of fruit ingested daily
   by the focal group during a control period preceding the removal
   experiment. We conducted removal experiments during periods when food
   density on territories appeared to be abundant and also when food
   abundance appeared to be low. Trumpeter food consumption did not change
   when fruit was removed during periods of resource abundance; however,
   when experimental removals were conducted during periods of food
   scarcity, the total energy value of food consumed decreased
   significantly. These results suggest that food abundance on trumpeter
   territories sometimes exceeds and sometimes is close to or below the
   amount needed to meet energy needs of the groups. Based on our data, we
   propose that territory size of White-winged Trumpeter groups reflects
   some minimum size needed to provide the group with a baseline level of
   food intake during seasonal periods of decreased food abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To identify nutritional risk factors for growth failure in

   Design A cohort of 40 infants with BPD was followed up for 7 monthly
   visits after initial hospital discharge. Data on potential risk factors
   were gathered prospectively.
   Subjects/setting Forty infants with BPD were recruited from all 4
   tertiary-level neonatal intensive care units in the Puget Sound area of
   Washington. Exclusionary criteria included congenital or chromosomal
   anomalies, grade IV intraventricular hemorrhage, and drug or alcohol
   exposure in utero.
   Main outcome measures Growth failure defined as weight less than the 5th
   percentile on National Center for Health Statistics growth curves at 2
   or more points in time and a decrease in weight-for-age z score during
   the study period.
   Statistical analyses performed Relative risk of growth failure with
   exposure to each risk factor was determined. The chi(2) test was used to
   measure association between growth and development, and change in z
   scores was used to examine growth patterns.
   Results Growth failure occurred in 8 of 40 infants. Twenty nine of the
   infants experienced a drop in weight-for-age z score from the initial to
   the final study visit. Growth failure was associated with low
   socioeconomic status (relative risk=4.0, 95\% confidence interval=1.3,

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity is adaptive for an organism inhabiting a variable
   environment if the optimal phenotype of a trait that affects fitness
   varies with environmental conditions, and if the organism can perceive
   environmental conditions and respond appropriately. Wilbur and Collins
   have proposed that amphibian larvae might respond adaptively to changes
   in their resource environment. If conditions for growth in the aquatic
   environment deteriorate, then a tadpole should metamorphose earlier and
   smaller than a tadpole under constant high growth conditions. Several
   experiments on a variety of species have tested this prediction, but
   only one demonstrated such a response. That experiment involved Couch's
   spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus couchii) and employed a gradual decrease in
   food level, whereas the others all used an abrupt switch from high to
   low food. The purpose of the present experiment was to examine the
   response of S. couchii to an abrupt change in food level, and to
   determine if the response depended on the level of two other factors,
   density and temperature, that also affect larval development. The
   average effects of the abrupt change in food level were similar to those
   seen in studies on other species: age at metamorphosis was primarily
   determined by the early food regime, and size at metamorphosis was
   determined by food level late in the larval period, suggesting that the
   effect of decreased food depends on how the food change is done.
   However, the response to even an abrupt food change depended on
   interactions with other environmental factors. At high temperature, high
   initial food, and low density, development was very rapid and tadpoles
   switched from high to low food metamorphosed at about the same time and
   size as those at constant high food. In contrast, under high temperature
   and high initial food conditions, but at high density, tadpoles switched
   to low food metamorphosed somewhat earlier and smaller, on average, than
   tadpoles kept at high food. At low temperature, the direction of
   response depended on density: tadpoles metamorphosed much smaller and
   slightly, but significantly, earlier at low density, but smaller and
   later at high density. The developmental response to increased food also
   varied with temperature. Larvae at high temperature metamorphosed
   earlier and larger than those at constant low food. At low temperature,
   larvae metamorphosed larger; but at nearly the same time as their
   counterparts at constant low food. The combination of high density and
   constant low food prevented any tadpoles from metamorphosing at high
   temperature, and allowed relatively few metamorphs at low temperature.
   Under conditions which impose either very rapid or retarded development,
   the opportunity to respond to altered food level may be limited.
   Interactions among environmental factors, therefore, may constrain
   responses to changing conditions, and may even prevent completion of
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining convincing evidence for spatial memory of natural food sources
   in wild animals is hard because the observer rarely knows as much about

   advantage of the scarcity of natural fruit sources in the subtropical
   winter to present a wild group of brown capuchin monkeys with a
   large-scale array of 15 feeding platforms spaced ca 200 m apart. With
   this array, I could control the location, productivity and renewal
   schedule of the major fruit sources used by these animals. Combining an
   independent measurement of their detection held for these platforms with
   the known locations of the platforms, I calculated the expected patterns
   of movement among platform sites by the group under various models of
   `random' foraging. These expected patterns were compared to the actual
   spatial movements of the group. The capuchin group moved significantly
   more often toward closer platforms and in straighter lines than expected
   by any random search model using their observed detection field of 82 m,
   although their behaviour did agree with such models for unrealistically
   large search fields of 225-350 m. I infer that the movements of this

   straight-line movement and a preference for closer platforms are in
   general not convincing evidence for spatial memory unless the detection

Abstract = {{Cannibalism is uncommon in most species despite being taxonomically

   important nutritional and competitive advantages to the cannibal. A
   general, but untested, explanation for why cannibalism is rare is that
   cannibals may be especially likely to acquire pathogens from
   conspecifics, owing to greater genetic similarity among conspecifics and
   selection for host specificity and resistance to host immune defences
   among pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by contrasting the fitness
   consequences of intra-versus interspecific predation of diseased and
   non-diseased prey. We fed cannibalistic tiger salamander (Ambystoma
   tigrinum) larvae diseased conspecifics, healthy conspecifics, diseased
   heterospecifics (a sympatric congener, small-mouthed salamanders, A.
   texanum), or healthy heterospecifics. Cannibals that ate diseased
   conspecifics were significantly less likely to survive to metamorphosis
   and grew significantly less than those that ate diseased
   heterospecifics, but none of the other groups differed. Tiger salamander
   larvae also preferentially preyed on heterospecifics when given a choice

Abstract = {{According to predictions from theoretical models, body mass and the

   lower their body mass and shift their foraging to the afternoons. I
   studied the effect of predator presence on daily mass gain in captive
   yellowhammers, Emberiza citrinella. The birds were tested in unisex
   pairs, one bird being dominant over the other. In the first treatment
   the amount of food was restricted, and the daily pattern of mass gain
   was recorded. The second treatment was identical to the first, but, in
   addition, a stuffed sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was displayed to the
   birds in the morning. Contrary to predictions from some theoretical
   models and other studies, the birds gained weight on days when the hawk
   was shown. Furthermore, the increased foraging happened mainly in the
   first half of the day, which also contradicts predictions from models.
   These results could be explained as a response to interrupted foraging,
   decreasing the probability of the birds acquiring the critical evening
   body mass. Alternatively, the birds increased their body reserves in
   preparation to leave a dangerous situation. Both dominance classes

   pregnanolone (1-10 mg/kg IP) on the intake and microstructure of licking
   for two sucrose solutions (1 and 3\%) in well familiarized nondeprived

   Methods. Participants received eight sessions of CBT and were then
   randomized to either exposure to pre-binge cues (B-ERP), exposure to
   pre-purge cues (P-ERP), or a relaxation training control condition
   (RELAX).
   Results. CBT produced significant clinical change. At the end of the
   behavioural treatments, there were no significant differences across the
   three groups on abstinence (66\% in B-ERP, 45\% in P-ERP and 47\% in
   RELAX), or frequency of bingeing and purging. B-ERP, but not P-ERP,
   significantly reduced anxiety on the cue reactivity assessment, food
   restriction, body dissatisfaction and depression. These differences were
   not maintained at 6-month follow-up. At 12-months, B-ERP was
   independently associated with lower food restriction and better global
   functioning.
   Conclusions. CBT is a highly effective treatment for bulimia nervosa.
   B-ERP was modestly superior to P-ERP at post-treatment; however, the
   advantage did not remain throughout the follow-up interval. ERP for
   bulimia nervosa is an expensive and logistically complicated treatment
   that does not appear to offer any significant additive benefits that are
   proportional to the amount of effort required to implement the
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the number of lifetime mating opportunities and mating
   behaviour of males in two sexually cannibalistic species, the
   Mediterranean, Iris oratoria, and bordered, Stagmomantis limbata,
   praying mantids (Mantodea: Mantidae). Two approaches estimated the
   number of lifetime mating opportunities: direct observations of
   intersexual encounters in the field, and an encounter model. I collected
   behavioural observations, together with ecological data for use in the
   model, over three field seasons. The ecological data included an
   assessment of the feeding condition of S. limbata females in nature; the
   females fed at a level comparable to females maintained on an abundant
   diet in the laboratory. As for the number of mating opportunities,
   individual males of both species encountered two or more females, as
   predicted by the model. I observed no male, however, in more than one
   copulation. This result could reflect individual variation in the times
   and places of sexual activity or an actual low number of mating
   opportunities in the field. Furthermore, a higher percentage of I.
   oratoria males encountered two or more females than S, limbata males, as
   the model indicates. Fewer mating opportunities could lead to greater
   selection upon S. limbata males to ensure paternity at each mating,
   which can explain the longer copulation times observed for S. limbata
   males. I considered two hypotheses about male behaviour in light of the
   number of lifetime encounters with females: male suicide and male
   reduction of the risk of cannibalism. Behavioural observations do not
   strongly support male suicide in either species. Certain male
   behaviours, such as the nature of copulatory position and, in captivity,
   mounting females from the rear, are consistent with the idea that males
   behave so as to reduce the probability that they are cannibalized during
   intersexual encounters. Moreover, male I. oratoria preferentially mount
   well-fed, fecund females in captivity. Taken together, these results
   suggest that the prospect of multiple mating opportunities has
   :influenced male mating behaviour over evolutionary time. (C) 1998 The

   behavioural responses of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and American toad
   (Bufo americanus) tadpoles to both direct and indirect chemical signals

   tadpoles of both species responded strongly to water conditioned with
   Anax nymphs by decreasing foraging rates, becoming immobile, and moving
   away from the stimulus. The responses to water conditioned with starved
   Anax versus Anax that fed on conspecific tadpoles did not differ
   significantly; these results suggest that tadpoles rely primarily on
   direct signals to detect odonates. Rana did not respond to water
   conditioned with conspecific tissue extracts, while Bufo responded with
   behaviours that were indistinguishable from those of tadpoles exposed to
   Anax-chemicals. In a field experiment, the responses of R. sylvatica
   tadpoles to Anax chemicals were similar to those of tadpoles observed in
   the laboratory. Collectively, our data indicate that tadpoles of both
   species use chemical cues to assess predation risk from other community
   members. Tadpoles can selectively distinguish members who pose a threat,
   and only evacuate food patches or reduce foraging rates when in danger.
   These behaviours appear to be adaptive and are consistent with the

Abstract = {{When animals reproduce, does energy for the brood come from stored
   reserves (from food eaten months or years before), or from food eaten
   during the current reproductive season? Variation in the duration of
   energy storage prior to reproduction is an important, but
   little-studied, axis of life history variation. We experimentally
   manipulated the availability of resources to females of a long-lived
   viviparous lizard (Eulamprus tympanum, Scincidae) in the first year of a
   two-year study to assess the relative importance of current food intake
   vs, stored reserves as sources of energy for breeding. Females given
   greater access to high temperatures (and hence, to resources) in the
   laboratory amassed larger caudal energy stores than did females with
   lesser opportunities. Energy intake during gestation slightly influenced
   offspring size, but the magnitude of energy stores prior to ovulation
   had a more dramatic effect: females with larger caudal energy stores
   produced much larger litters in the following year. Growth rates of
   females were unaffected by basking treatments or by reproduction in
   either year, but females that reproduced in the second year showed a
   large concomitant decrease in caudal energy stores compared to females
   that did not reproduce, indicating a large energetic cost of
   reproduction. Hence, reproductive output within this species can be
   influenced by resource availability over 12 months prior to
   reproduction, and simple comparisons of reproductive output with current
   resource availability may fail to detect the ways in which
   phenotypically plastic life history traits are influenced by
   environmental features. In addition to an appropriate temporal
   framework, models of resource allocation should also incorporate the
   possible roles of physiological and morphological constraints (e.g.,
   maternal inability, in some species, to modify post ovulation
   reproductive expenditure) and trade-offs with other life history
   currencies (e.g., decrements in maternal survival due to high relative
   clutch masses). The time lag between resource acquisition and
   expenditure may have significant consequences for a population's
   demographic response to shifts in resource availability or predation
   pressure (via tail autotomy). Finally, this study illustrates the way in
   which thermal aspects of the environment can influence life history
   phenotypes in ectothermic vertebrates with long-term energy stores.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of early juvenile sablefish, Anoplopoma
   fimbria (Pallas), and their behavioral responses to changing food and
   temperature conditions were examined in laboratory experiments. Although
   field collections have suggested that juveniles are obligate residents
   of the neuston, laboratory experiments on diel movements indicated the
   potential for downward movement during the day, when activity levels
   were high and active foraging would be likely. The relationship of
   downward movement to fish size (small vs. large juveniles), prior
   feeding success (high vs. low rations) and thermal structure of the
   water column (isothermal vs. varying intensities of thermal
   stratification) were tested. Thermal stratification inhibited downward
   movement, with sablefish displaying clear avoidance of cold water even
   when the thermal gradient was moderate (12 degrees C top layer and 8
   degrees C bottom layer). However, sablefish could be induced to swim
   downward into cold water if food was introduced beneath the thermocline.
   Across all temperature treatments, occurrence in cold water
   significantly increased when food was present. Increasing the sharpness
   of the thermal gradient (top layer = 12 degrees C, bottom layer = 8, 6,
   4 or 2 degrees C) did not affect the percentage of time spent in cold
   water, but did shorten the maximum time an individual would spend
   beneath the thermocline. Movement into cold water constituted a
   potentially lethal risk for juvenile sablefish; dives beneath the
   thermocline that exceeded 60 s resulted in loss of equilibrium and
   immediate death for small fish moving from 12 to 2 degrees C water.
   Thus, sablefish displayed behavioral trade-offs between food acquisition
   and the physiological risk of cold temperatures, similar to previous
   studies documenting balancing of foraging behavior and predation risk.
   Behavioral responses to thermal stratification were modified by fish
   size and hunger level, with larger juveniles and those held on low
   rations spending more time in cold water. These behavioral responses
   correspond with the high feeding requirements necessary to maintain the
   naturally rapid growth rates of this species and the transitions in
   habitat associated with different life history stages. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The efforts in optimizing feeding conditions of food producing animals
   in the past were focussed primarily on promoting performance and/or the
   products' quality (MEYER 1997). In spite of great success in this
   direction various risks occure due to the conflict between the increased
   requirements on the one hand and the species typical demands on the
   other (for example: need of roughage as well as of concentrates with
   high energy and nutrient density in ruminants). Especially in feeding
   high yielding dairy cows the conflict is obvious: Even in the case, that
   high amounts of concentrates are fed it becomes more and more difficult
   to meet the energy requirement when the milk yield exceeds 40 kg milk
   per day (FLACHOWSKY a. LEBZIEN 1997). A negative energy balance is
   accompanied by a forced predisposition for ketosis and infertility
   (KRUIP 1996).
   Insufficient proportions of roughage in those rations predispose the
   animals for rumen acidosis and associated problems (health of claws
   etc.) as well as for displacement of abomasum. Thereby in feeding high
   yielding dairy cows there is only the choice between different risks due
   to the fact that the feed intake capacity did not increase to the same
   extent as the milk production did. In fattening calves the use of
   roughage tin Germany required by law) is on debate in this direction
   (necessary to avoid disturbances in the behaviour). Further problems in
   feeding animals according to their species typical demands are related
   to the established conditions of housing, feeding and water supply
   (risks of mechanization and automatization due to potential
   disfunction). The gene rally increased feeding intensity results - for
   example in poultry - in a higher frequency of skeleton diseases; the
   more and more specialized pig production (separate units for piglet
   production, rearing units, fattening units) is accompanied by increased
   changes in diets and techniques of feed and water supply, to that the
   animals have to be accustomed. too.
   The science of animal nutrition gets more and more involved in questions
   on the species depending requirements that guarantee a physiological
   development of the animal, health and normal behaviour. There is an
   increased need to create and evaluate parameters that can be used for
   characterization animals' well-being related to different feeding
   strategies. Without any doubts it is a special task to veterinary
   nutritionists to point out risks, problems, conflicting aimes when the
   feeding intensity is forced continuously. The slogan,,back to nature{''}
   is too simple and does not correspond to the complexity of efforts which
   are suitable and necessary to meet animals` energy and nutrient
   requirements as well as demands of animals' welfare. Eventually it is
   helpful to remember sometimes the limits set up by the biology and
   physiology when feeding intensity or techniques are on debate.}},

Abstract = {{For many benthic fish species, initial settlement patterns are dependent
   on the supply of larvae to nursery grounds, and recent work on flatfish
   population dynamics indicates that larval supply may influence
   recruitment. After the larvae arrive on the nursery grounds, selection
   of an appropriate substratum is necessary to maximize their subsequent
   growth and survival. This paper describes the results of experiments
   undertaken to determine the behavioural responses of settling plaice,
   Pleuronectes platessa, to the presence of food and predators. Reared
   plaice larvae were starved for 24 h, transferred to aquaria and the
   proportion of time spent on the sediment was recorded in four
   treatments: no food, benthic food, pelagic food, and benthic + pelagic
   food. The food supply consisted of newly hatched Artemia as pelagic food
   and meiofauna extracted from natural sediment as benthic food. Settling
   behaviour was evident for late stage 3b larvae but there was no effect
   of food supply on time spent on the sediment. Stage 4b and early stage 5
   larvae spent significantly more time on the bottom in the food
   treatments than in the no-food treatment. No differences could be
   established between food treatments. In another experiment, with the
   potential predator Crangon crangon as stimulus, stage 4b and early stage
   5 larvae spent significantly more time on the bottom when predators were
   absent than when predators were present. Behavioural preferences were
   also studied to establish if benthic food and potential predators, C.
   crangon, influenced habitat selection. Newly metamorphosed plaice (mean
   TL 13 mm) were given a choice of sediment with and without food and in a
   separate experiment, a choice of sediment with and without predators.
   Plaice spent significantly more time on a sediment with benthic food
   than on one without food and on st sediment devoid of predators than on
   one with predators. The habitat selection experiments showed that food
   supply and predators can influence distribution patterns on a small

Abstract = {{Over the past half century, a methodology has been used to investigate

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have not fully resolved the state-dependent

   abnormalities.
   Methods: Seventy-eight unmedicated patients with major depressive
   disorder were stratified into abnormal and normal subgroups on the basis
   of pretreatment sleep study results. Two prospectively defined types of
   sleep variables were studied: those expected to be traitlike or state
   independent (type 1) and those predicted to be reversible or state
   dependent (type 2).
   Results: The type 1 sleep disturbances (reduced rapid eye movement
   latency, decreased delta sleep ratio, and decreased slow wave sleep
   {[}in percentage]) were stable, as predicted, across time. A composite
   measure of type 2 disturbances (based on rapid eye movement latency,
   sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement density) improved
   significantly, although a minority of patients in remission had

Abstract = {{It has been observed that susceptibility to many degenerative diseases
   increases concurrently with industrialization and rising living
   standards. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that specific
   environmental and dietary factors may be important, caloric intake alone
   (as reflected in body size) may account for much of the differential
   risk observed among diverse human populations. it has been suggested
   from animal studies that caloric intake may be the primary effector for
   many hormonal, metabolic, physiologic, and behavioral responses that
   coordinate reproductive strategy to apparent availability of food. When
   caloric intake is excessive, particularly at critical developmental
   stages, physiologic priorities are set for body growth and fecundity
   rather than for endurance and longevity. The converse occurs during
   periods of famine, thus increasing the probability that sufficient
   individuals survive to restore the population when conditions improve.
   Calorically restricted rodents have significantly longer reproductive
   and total life spans than their ad libitum-fed controls and exhibit a
   spectrum of biochemical and physiologic alterations that characterize
   their adaptation to reduced caloric intake. These include reduced
   stature, hypercorticism in the absence of elevated adrenocorticotropic
   hormone levels, increased metabolic efficiency, decreased mitogenic
   response coupled with increased rates of apoptosis, reduced inflammatory
   response, induction of stress proteins and DNA repair enzymes, altered

   function. The overall profile of these changes is one of improved

   radiation-and chemically induced cancers in experimental animals. It may
   also explain the significantly higher thresholds of acute toxicity
   observed when calorically restricted rodents are exposed to certain lest

Abstract = {{In the ponerine ant Ectatomma ruidum, workers displaying outside
   activities belong to, at least five behavioral categories, including
   namely hunters. When faced with small and numerous prey, hunters
   specialize into two behavioral sub-categories: stingers, which stay in
   the hunting site and kill prey in serial, and transporters which perform
   numerous single-loaded trips to the nest. Seven colonies showing
   different sizes (24 to 350 workers) were studied. Although the number of
   both categories of hunters gradually increases with colony size, me
   proportions of stingers (23\%) and transporters (77\%) remain relatively
   stable. In young foundations and small colonies, a more in depth study
   of the emergence of the behavioral specialization of the first stinger
   among predators indicates a gradually differentiation during
   sociogenesis for developmental colony stages corresponding to 15-22
   workers. By a temporary removing of all individuals specialized in
   stinging behavior, we showed that some of the transporters can
   differentiate into stingers, securing the efficiency of the predatory
   behavior. The behavioral differentiation of a given hunter into stinger
   or transporter depends both on individual characteristics
   (specialization and activity levels, previous experience, decision
   making) and on social characteristics (behavior of cooperating
   individuals, task competition, colonial starvation state). Relationships
   between collective performances and individual capacities allow to
   explain the important flexibility of the predatory behavior of E. ruidum
   and, more generally, of its foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Visalberghi and Fragaszy {[}Animal Behaviour 49:1089-1095, 1995] have
   shown that social influences affect acceptance of novel foods. However,
   little is known about the temporal. course on which such influences act
   (e.g., for how long they persist and for how many encounters they are
   effective). To explore this issue, 11 adult tufted capuchins were
   observed during ten successive encounters with eight unfamiliar foods
   (phase 1, in which subjects were tested in social or individual
   condition) and ten more encounters 6 months later (phase 2, in which all
   subjects were tested in social condition). A total of 680 observational
   sessions were carried out. Results show that during the first five
   encounters in phase 1, capuchins ate more when they encountered these
   foods in the presence of their groupmates than if they encountered them
   alone. Thereafter, during the second five encounters of phase 1, foods
   were consumed equivalently whether presented to monkeys socially or
   individually. In phase 2, the foods were consumed equivalently
   regardless of the previous circumstance of their presentation (social or
   alone). In phase 2, consumption was similar to that scored in a previous
   study for familiar foods {[}Visalberghi \& Fragaszy, Animal Behaviour
   49:1089-1095, 1995]. We conclude that 1) foods remain unfamiliar to
   capuchins only for the first few encounters, 2) social facilitation of
   consumption of unfamiliar foods is of limited duration, and 3)
   individuals consumed equivalent amounts of an unfamiliar food when they
   repeatedly encountered it alone or in the presence of groupmates. These
   results caution those who interpret similar feeding habits in primate

Abstract = {{The effects of food restriction on predation risk-taking behavior were
   studied in juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, during the period
   before seawater migration in the spring. A radiographic technique
   enabled the study of individual food intake in a safe and risky food
   patch before and after exposure to a piscivorous predator. The study
   revealed a significant increase in food intake and specific growth rate
   in the weeks following deprivation, resulting in compensatory growth and
   a recovery of the weight loss caused by dietary restriction. The
   increase in food intake resulted from a change in risk-taking behavior.
   Following a period of diet restriction, the fish habituated faster after
   predator exposure, and the proportion of fish in the risky patch was
   significantly higher than before deprivation. Deprived fish took greater
   shares of the group meal compared with control fish, and the pattern of
   the individual share of the group meal after food restriction indicated
   a change in the social hierarchy. This study indicates that risk-taking
   behavior is state dependent and changes temporarily to compensate for a
   period of food restriction. The results are discussed in terms of
   trade-offs between food and risk in a period leading up to an

   vasopressin in the rat}},
Journal = {{BIOGENIC AMINES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{367-385}},
Abstract = {{Arginine-vasopressin (AVP), a mammalian neuropeptide, has been
   postulated to function as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. There is
   clinical evidence that, apart from its role in affective illness, AVP
   may be involved in anxiety syndromes as well. The present study
   investigated the putative anxiogenic effect of intracerebroventricularly
   (i.c.v.) AVP administered in rats, using well validated animal models of
   anxiety, including the open-field, elevated plus-maze, social
   interaction and feeding latency in a novel environment tests.
   Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as the standard
   anxiogenic agent for comparison. In addition, the effect of AVP was
   assessed on rat brain tribulin activity in terms of endogenous monoamine
   oxidase (MAO) A and B inhibition. Tribulin has been shown to be an
   endocoid marker of anxiety and stress. AVP (100, 200 and 500 ng/rat,
   i.c.v.) produced a dose-related decrease in ambulation and rears, and an
   increase in immobility and defaecation, in the open-field test. These
   doses of AVP produced a dose-related decrease in the number of entries
   and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, reduced
   social interaction in paired rats and increased the latency to feed in
   an unfamiliar environment in food-deprived rats. A qualitatively similar
   behavioural response was induced by PTZ in all the test parameters. AVP
   and PTZ increased rat brain tribulin activity, the increase in the MAO A
   inhibitor component being more marked than that on the MAO B inhibitor
   component, consonant with earlier studies with several anxiogenic agents
   and anxiety during addictive drug withdrawal in rats. The findings
   indicate that AVP exhibits an anxiogenic effect, unlike the earlier
   reported anxiolytic effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), its
   physiological antagonist, in rats. The anxiogenic effects of AVP (200
   and 500 ng/rat, i.c.v.) and PTZ were inhibited by the benzodiazepine
   anxiolytic, lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the selective
   dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist, pimozide (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited
   only the anxiogenic effect of AVP. The results of the present study
   indicate that AVP induces significant anxiogenic response in rats which
   may be dopamine-mediated, like its antidiuretic effect in this species.
   AVP and ANP have contrary effects on water homeostasis and may be
   involved in the syndrome of acute water intoxication seen in psychiatric
   patients. The present investigations suggest that this postulate may
   hold relevance in view of the opposite effects of AVP and ANP on
   behaviour.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-94}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A major objective in behavioural and evolutionary ecology is to
   understand how animals make decisions in complex environments.
   Examinations of animal behaviour typically use optimization models to
   predict the choices animals ought to make. The performance of animals
   under specific conditions is then compared against the predicted optimal
   strategy. This optimization approach has come into question because
   model predictions often do not match animal behaviour exactly. This has
   led to serious scepticism about the ability of animals to exhibit
   optimal behaviour in complex environments. We show that conventional
   approaches that compare observed animal behaviour with single optimal
   values may bias the way we view real-world variation in animal
   performance. Considerable insight into the abilities of animals to make
   optimal decisions can be gained by interpreting why variability in
   performance exists. We introduce a new theoretical framework, called
   `multi-objective optimization', which allows us to examine
   decision-making in complex environments and interpret the meaning of
   variability in animal performance. A multi-objective approach defines
   the set of efficient choices animals may make in attempting to reach
   compromises among multiple conflicting demands. In a multi-objective
   framework, we may see variation in animal choices, but, unlike
   single-objective optimizations where there is one `best solution', this
   variation may represent a range of adaptive compromises to conflicting
   objectives. An important feature of this approach is that, within the
   set of efficient alternatives, no choice can be considered to yield
   higher fitness, a priori, than any other choice. Thus, variability and
   optimal behaviour may be entirely consistent. We illustrate our point
   using selected examples from foraging theory where there is already an
   optimization program in place.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-37}},
Abstract = {{To test the importance of predators and food availability in determining
   patterns of aggregation and movement in the urchin Tetrapygus niger, we
   studied the behavioral responses of animals with different body sizes
   under laboratory conditions. Experiments were carried out on a square
   platform in tanks with circulating water. Twelve sea urchins of three
   size ranges were placed following a uniform spatial distribution on the
   platform and maintained in the presence or absence of: (a) one predator
   (the fish Pinguipes chilensis or the asteroid Meyenaster gelatinosus),
   or (b) food (fronds of the brown kelp Lessonia nigrescens). The
   experiments were followed with a video camera. The movement patterns of
   the sea urchins, the number and size of aggregations, and the dispersion
   patterns were quantified. To determine the importance of aggregation as
   a defensive mechanism, artificial aggregations of large sea urchins were
   created on the platform in the presence or absence of predators.
   Behavioral responses were followed and analyzed as described above.
   Individuals of T. niger recognize the presence of predators, and respond
   with increased mobility (e.g., number of sea urchins moving or average
   speed of movement; i.e., escape responses) but do not increase the
   number or size of aggregations. Moreover, the increased mobility of sea
   urchins would account for the random spatial distribution of individuals
   at the end of the experiments with predators. The escape responses were
   specially marked in the presence of the starfish M. gelatinosus. In this
   case, the aggregations were unstable, suggesting that the aggregations
   of T. niger would not have a protective function against this starfish.
   By contrast, sea urchins aggregated in the presence of food. It is
   concluded that the generation of aggregations in this species would be
   more related to feeding patterns (or to other factors related to spatial
   heterogeneity; e.g., substrate topography) than to responses to
   predators. The escape behavior of sea urchins to starfish is also
   described.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory predicts that organisms can increase their
   fitness by helping or not harming relatives, and many animals modify
   their behavior toward kin in a manner consistent with this prediction.
   Morphogenesis also may be sensitive to kinship environment, particularly
   in species where certain individuals facultatively develop structures
   that can be used against conspecifics as weaponry. We tested this
   hypothesis by examining whether and how consanguinity affected the
   probability that a structurally distinctive carnivore phenotype, which
   is opportunistically cannibalistic, would be produced in plains
   spadefoot toad tadpoles (Spea bombifrons) and southern spadefoot toad
   tadpoles (S. multiplicata). For tadpoles of S. multiplicata, individuals
   were significantly more likely to express the carnivore phenotype in
   mixed sibship groups than in pure sibship groups. For tadpoles of S.
   bombifrons, individuals were significantly more likely to express the
   carnivore phenotype when reared alone than in pure sibship groups. Both
   outcomes were independent of food availability or sibship specific
   differences in size or growth rate, and waterborne chemical signals from
   nonkin were sufficient to trigger expression of the carnivore phenotype.
   Our results suggest that morphogenesis may be responsive to kinship
   environment in any species or population that occurs as multiple,
   environmentally induced forms (polyphenism) that differ in their ability
   to help or to harm others.}},

Abstract = {{More than 250 studies, covering 29 Northern and five Southern Hemisphere
   countries, have been published on the birth seasonality of individuals
   who develop schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Despite
   methodological problems, the studies are remarkably consistent in
   showing a 5-8\% winter-spring excess of births for both schizophrenia
   and mania/bipolar disorder. This seasonal birth excess is also found in
   schizoaffective disorder (December-March), major depression (March-May),
   and autism (March) but not in other psychiatric conditions with the
   possible exceptions of eating disorders and antisocial personality
   disorder. The seasonal birth pattern also may shift over time, Attempts
   to correlate the seasonal birth excess with specific features of
   schizophrenia suggest that winter-spring births are probably related to
   urban births and to a negative family history. Possible correlations
   include lesser severity of illness and neurophysiological measures.
   There appears to be no correlation with gender, social class, race,
   measurable pregnancy and birth complications, clinical subtypes, or
   neurological, neuropsychological, or neuroimaging measures. Virtually no
   correlation studies have been done for bipolar disorder. Regarding the
   cause of the birth seasonality, statistical artifact and parental
   procreational habits are unlikely explanations. Seasonal effects of
   genes, subtle pregnancy and birth complications, light and internal
   chemistry, toxins, nutrition, temperature/weather, and infectious agents

Abstract = {{Previous work has established a number of sex-related deficits in immune
   function, behavior, and endocrine responses to stress in the offspring
   of dams exposed to ethanol. To examine the potential role of maternal
   glucocorticoids as a mediator of these sexually dimorphic effects in the
   fetus, we examined the influence of prenatal alcohol exposure in the
   presence or absence of maternal glucocorticoids on fetal plasma
   corticosterone (CORT) production. An additional question to be addressed
   by these studies was whether maternal adrenalectomy could eliminate the
   known inhibition by ethanol of the prenatal surge of plasma testosterone
   in male fetuses.
   Pregnant dams were adrenalectomized (ADX) or sham-adrenalectomized on
   gestational day (G) 7 and placed on a liquid diet containing 35\%
   ethanol-derived calories or pair-fed an isocaloric control diet
   throughout the experiment. On G18, G19, and G21, plasma levels of CORT,
   testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured in male
   and female fetuses and their mothers. Ethanol administration
   consistently increased maternal plasma CORT levels but did not
   significantly alter CORT levels in the fetus. Maternal ADX resulted in
   compensatory increases in fetal CORT levels that were lower in fetuses
   of ADX dams on alcohol, suggesting a direct effect of ethanol on fetal
   pituitary-adrenal activity. There were no significant sex differences in
   fetal plasma CORT levels in response to ang of these manipulations.
   A novel surge of maternal plasma DHEA was found on G19 that was absent
   in plasma from ADX dams. In spite of the absence of a surge on G19,
   plasma DHEA levels of ADX dams rose from very low levels at G18 to
   levels on G21 that were significantly higher than in Sham dams. A normal
   testosterone surge was observed in male fetuses on G18 and G19 from
   sham-adrenalectomized dams administered the pair-fed diet. However, this
   surge was greatly attenuated in males administered ethanol and also in
   male fetuses from ADX dams. These results reveal a direct inhibitory
   influence of ethanol on fetal CORT secretion as well as on the prenatal
   testosterone surge in males. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the
   presence of a surge of DHEA in the pregnant rat. Overall, these data
   suggest that there is a critical adrenal factor in the rat that
   regulates the maternal surge of DHEA on G19 and the prenatal
   testosterone surge of male fetuses on G18-19.}},

Abstract = {{It is well recognised that although nutritionally breast milk is the
   optimal food for babies, there are a number of caveats to this, based on
   the consequences of the modem lifestyle. Here we have considered ways in
   which the young breast fed child may be exposed to various environmental
   and medical contaminants which might cause adverse reactions and to
   which he/she may not otherwise be exposed. These substances are divided
   into four different areas: (i) medication taken by the mother; (ii)
   exposure to possibly addictive drugs taken by the mother; (iii) exposure
   to pollutants mainly from the maternal diet or as the result of her
   occupation; (iv) viruses. The infant who consumes breast milk may be
   exposed to a variety of chemicals which may have untoward effects on
   his/her immediate health and temperament and future development.
   Potentially hazardous substances ingested by the breast fed infant
   include medicaments (or their metabolites) that may have been ingested
   by the mother, potentially addictive common neurotoxicants such as
   nicotine, caffeine and alcohol, illicit drugs such as heroin and
   cocaine, and pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and
   dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). There is a paucity of good
   information on which to base reliable estimates of the harm that this
   may cause the child. Although breast feeding is known to protect against
   bacterial infection, a number of viruses are excreted in the breast milk
   which may infect the child asymptomatically (e.g. cytomegalovirus,
   Epstein-Barr virus) and which are not known to be harmful, as well as
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) excretion which, in contrast, does
   appear to increase the risk of the child becoming infected. Balancing
   the risk of infection to the child born to an HIV infected mother,
   results in the proposition that known HIV positive women in developing
   countries (where the risk of gastrointestinal infection is high) should
   continue to breast feed but those in the developed world (where the risk
   of gastrointestinal infection is lower) are better advised to bottle
   feed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory experiment was conducted in order to explore the

   box, Their initial manipulative actions, performed when exposed to the
   box in a subsequent test, were compared with those of naive control
   subjects (non-observers). The observers showed less exploratory

   strong tendency to use the demonstrated opening technique in the initial
   test phase. This initial preference disappeared in the course of five
   test sessions and the observers converged towards the simpler,

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether college athletes are at greater risk for
   maladaptive lifestyle and health-risk behaviors than their nonathletic
   peers and to identify high risk taking groups by gender, sport, and
   other identifiers.
   Design: Multicenter, cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Seven major geographically represented collegiate institutions
   in the United States.
   Participants: A total of 2,298 college athletes and 683 randomized
   nonathlete controls completed a confidential survey questionnaire
   between the summer of 1993 and winter of 1994, assessing lifestyle and
   health-risk behaviors over the previous 12 months.
   Main outcome measures: Self-reports of lifestyle behaviors and health
   risks in the following areas: motor-vehicle safety, substance abuse,
   sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, mental health, cancer
   prevention, nutrition, exercise and general preventive health issues.
   Results: Athletes demonstrated significantly higher risk-taking
   behaviors (p < 0.05) than their nonathlete peers in the following areas:
   less likely always to use seatbelts; less likely always to use helmets
   with motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles: more often drive as a passenger
   with a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs: greater quantity
   and frequency of alcoholic beverages; greater frequency of smokeless
   tobacco and anabolic steroid use; less-safe sex; greater number of
   sexual partners; less contraceptive use: and more involvement in
   physical fights. Female athletes reported a higher prevalence of
   irregular menses, amenorrhea, and stress fractures compared with female
   nonathletes. Male athletes had more risk-taking behaviors than did
   female athletes (p < 0.05), and athletes in contact sports demonstrated
   more risk-taking behaviors than did athletes in noncontact sports (p <
   0.05). Athletes with one risk-taking behavior were likely to have
   multiple risk-taking behaviors (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: College athletes appear to be at higher risk than their
   nonathletic peers for certain maladaptive lifestyle behaviors. Athlete
   subgroups at highest risk include male athletes and athletes
   participating in contact sports. Athletes at risk for one high-risk
   behavior demonstrated an increased risk for multiple risk-taking
   behaviors. Preventive health interventions deserve further study to
   determine strategies for risk reduction in high-risk groups.}},

Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1805-1815}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models for the evolution of inducible anti-predator defenses
   predict that there should be fitness costs associated with the defense,
   otherwise it should be permanent. Thus, in the absence of predators and
   with limited resources, defended individuals are expected to be
   outcompeted by individuals lacking the costly defense. Crucian carp,
   Carassius carassius, increase in body depth in response to chemical
   stimuli from piscivorous fish, and the deeper body constitutes a
   morphological defense against gape-limited piscivores. Here, we have
   performed a field experiment investigating effects of population density
   on the relative competitive performance of shallow-bodied and
   deep-bodied crucian carp. We assigned groups of six individually marked
   fish (the `'focal'' individuals) of either morph into enclosures with
   either low or high crucian carp density, and monitored changes in body
   mass, length, and body depth of these fish for 4 mo. In addition, we
   determined sex, and final liver and gonadal mass, of all focal fish.
   At high population density, there was a reduction in food resources
   (zooplankters), which resulted in reduced gonad mass, reduced
   gonadosomatic indices, and reduced growth in fish of both morphs.
   Unexpectedly, the relative allocation to livers was higher at high
   density. There was no difference in body mass gain between morphs at the
   low density, whereas at the high density shallow-bodied fish gained
   twice as much body mass as deep-bodied fish. Hence, when predators were
   absent and food resources were limited, deep-bodied individuals suffered
   a substantial cost when competing with shallow-bodied conspecifics.
   This study verifies the theoretical prediction that an inducible defense
   results in fitness costs in the absence of predators. Further, as we
   found no measurable disadvantage of the deep-bodied morphology at high
   food availability but a strong disadvantage under intense competition
   for food, our results also demonstrate the importance of relating
   defense costs to levels of intraspecific competition.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed how a consumer should simultaneously trade-off search speed

   are considered. In the analyses, consumers were allowed to co-ordinate
   activity or behave independently in relation to other consumers. The
   ESS-analysis of the game ensures that no mutant can invade the system.
   The independent activity was found to be optimal in all analyses, while
   the co-ordinated activity was only optimal at full activity where the
   two activity strategies coincided. The model showed that consumers
   should change activity to account for predation risk. Activity generally
   decreased with predation risk. Concerning the energetic aspects, both
   activity and search speed were important to account for the reproductive
   output. The functional responses influenced the optimum activity and
   search speed of consumers and predators. In general, the optimum
   behaviours showed complex non-linear responses in relation to the
   resource and the consumer density. A predator type II functional
   response had profound impacts on the properties of the optima, the

Abstract = {{Previous research showed that pigs reared in substrate-impoverished
   conditions performed a smaller proportion of their total behavioural
   repertoire in their home pens (showed lower behavioural diversity), than
   pigs reared in substrate-enriched conditions. This study examined
   whether these differences were the result of fundamental changes in
   behavioural organisation. A T-maze task was used to test the hypothesis
   that substrate-impoverished pigs are prone to develop fixed, unvarying
   behaviour which may underlie their reduced behavioural diversity. They
   were predicted to be poorer at reversing previous response patterns in
   the maze, and less able to alter their behaviour in response to a novel
   (distracting) stimulus. Female pigs were housed singly for five months
   in substrate-impoverished pens with bare concrete floors (N = 10) or
   substrate-enriched pens with straw and other foraging material (N = 10).
   The pigs were then trained to negotiate a T-maze to reach a food source.
   There were no differences in responses to a distracting stimulus in the
   start arm of the maze but, contrary to expectation, substrate-enriched
   pigs were less able to change their behaviour when the route to food was
   switched. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported. During training
   trials, substrate-enriched pigs moved fairly rapidly to the food while
   substrate-impoverished pigs spent more time investigating the maze;
   their motivation to `explore' the maze appeared to override their
   interest in food. The rapid, food-directed behaviour of the
   substrate-enriched pigs probably became more fixed and routine-like than
   the more exploratory behaviour of the substrate-impoverished pigs. The
   apparent importance of exploration to pigs reared in
   substrate-impoverished environments suggests that such conditions
   provide inadequate stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{A widely held idea regarding information processing in the brain is the

   to a specific stimulus. This work presents a novel method of
   characterizing this supposed activity using a hidden Markov model. This
   model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity
   of behavioural processes. In our study the process in hand was the
   simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex
   of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the
   behavioural mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding
   collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data
   into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state
   dependence of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair
   of cells. Thus, this cross-correlation depends on the network state of
   activity and not on local connectivity alone.}},

Abstract = {{We tested for effects of temporal and spatial variation in;prey density

   (1989-1994) of two subdivided populations of adders, Vipera berus,
   inhabiting two groups of islands (Angskar and In-Fredeln) in the Baltic
   Sea to estimate, compare, and model survival and capture probabilities,
   and to test for effects of time, locality, sex, and vole density on
   survival, using the computer program SURGE. TO quantify variation in
   prey availability among years and localities we trapped field voles,
   Microtus agrestis, the primary prey of adders, every year from 1989 to
   1993 on the islands where we captured snakes. We found that vole
   densities showed large fluctuations among years at In-Fredeln but
   remained relatively low throughout the study period at Angskar. Annual
   survival probabilities of adders varied in a nonparallel manner through
   time between localities and ranged from 0.36 to 1.00, with a mean of
   0.72 across years and localities. Survival did not differ between males

   voles in one of the two populations (In-Fredeln), suggesting that
   starvation may have been an important source of snake mortality in some
   years, or that physiological stress resulting from food shortage may
   render individuals more susceptible to predators and diseases. Adders at
   In-Fredeln also grew faster and were in better body condition when vole
   density was high than when it was low. Inter-island movement rates of
   adders ranged from 0 to 29\% among years but were not correlated with
   vole density, suggesting that the relationship between snake survival

Abstract = {{Trophic cascades are regarded as important signals for top-down control
   of food web dynamics. Although there is clear evidence supporting the
   existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important
   dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct
   population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby
   decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels.
   Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level
   effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in
   response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced
   feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of
   herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two
   mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of
   herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We
   created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued,
   and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then
   systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at
   behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms.
   At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk
   spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts
   in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the
   grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider
   treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was
   significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders,
   indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects.
   At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments
   decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the
   existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation
   spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again
   indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory
   to risk effects. We conclude that indirect effects resulting from
   antipredator behavior can produce trophic-level effects-that are similar
   in form and strength to those generated by direct predation events.}},

Abstract = {{Caenorhabditis elegans uses a variety of attractive olfactory cues to
   detect food. We show here that the responses to olfactory cues are
   regulated in a dynamic way by behavioral context and the animal's
   previous experience. Prolonged exposure to an odorant leads to a
   decreased response to that odorant, a form of behavioral plasticity
   called olfactory adaptation. We show that starvation can increase the
   extent of olfactory adaptation to the odorant benzaldehyde; this effect
   of starvation persists for several hours after the animals have been
   returned to food. The effect of starvation is antagonized by exogenous
   serotonin, which induces many of the same behavioral responses in C.
   elegans as are induced by food. Starvation also inhibits recovery from
   adaptation to a different odorant, 2-methylpyrazine, thus enhancing
   olfactory memory. In addition to its effects on adaptation, starvation
   modulates olfactory discrimination in C. elegans; starved animals
   discriminate more classes of odorants than fed animals. Increased
   olfactory discrimination is also seen in the adaptation-defective mutant
   adp-1(ky20). These various forms of behavioral plasticity enhance the
   ability of starved animals to respond to novel, potentially informative

   traits has been attributed to changes in climate, duration of breeding
   season, predation, and food limitation. I use a phylogenetic approach to
   show that life histories are closely associated with breeding elevation
   in extant cardueline finches. Finches at high elevations had smaller
   clutches, fewer broods, and longer incubation periods. Neither food
   limitation nor nest predation appear to readily account for this strong
   elevational variation in cardueline life histories. However, juvenile
   survival may be greater at higher elevations as a result of prolonged
   parental care and shorter natal dispersal and can potentially compensate
   for reduced fecundity in high-elevation finches.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of recent theoretical interest, few field studies have
   addressed the links between individual behavioral decisions and
   population distribution. This work analyzes the foraging behavior of
   individuals and the spatial distribution of a population of blue tits
   (Parus caeruleus) just before the main breeding season, when blue tit
   foraging was not affected by central-place or flocking behaviors. The
   study was carried out in open helm oak Quercus ilex woodlands (dehesas)
   that are patchy for canopy-foraging birds because of the scattered
   arrangement of trees. Residence time on each tree was not correlated
   either with previous flight time or with prey abundance in trees. Flight
   distances between trees were larger than average distances estimated ill
   random samples of holm oaks taken close to foraging birds. Trees were
   not selected by birds on the basis of their expected energy costs and
   rewards. Bird abundance was not related to food availability in trees or
   to tree size across dehesas. However, bird abundance was strongly
   correlated with tree density and with the availability of tree holes for
   nesting, to the extent that the proportion of tits matched the
   proportions of both tree abundance and hole abundance across study
   plots. Overall, neither the behavior of individuals nor the distribution
   of the population of blue tits corresponded with food resources, which
   appeared superabundant; instead, tits appeared to behave and be
   distributed according to the distribution of structural resources such
   as trees and tree holes for nesting.}},

Title = {{Free food or earned food? A review and fuzzy model of contrafreeloading}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1171-1191}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animals will work (e.g. lever press) for `earned' food even though
   identical `free' food can easily be obtained from a nearby dish. This
   phenomenon, called contrafreeloading, appears to contradict a basic
   tenet of most learning, motivation and optimal foraging theories; namely
   that animals strive to maximize the ratio of reward, or benefit, to
   effort, or cost. This paper reviews the factors that have been found to
   affect the level of contrafreeloading, to try to explain the behaviour.
   In experiments involving intensive training, contrafreeloading may be
   explained on the basis of secondary reinforcement and/or differential
   exposure to the alternative food sources. However, contrafreeloading
   also occurs without prior training. Contrafreeloading declines with
   increasing hunger and with increases in the effort required to obtain
   the earned food: it also has an inverted-U relationship with the degree
   of stimulus change associated with the earned food. A fuzzy logic model
   is developed to predict the outcome of interactions between these
   factors. The model successfully simulates previous empirical findings
   and provides novel, testable predictions. It is argued that
   contrafreeloading does not contradict reinforcement theory, provided
   that the sensory reinforcement obtained from stimuli associated with the
   earned food is also taken into account. A functional explanation of why
   such stimuli are reinforcing, and of contrafreeloading itself, is based
   upon the advantage of gathering information for animals living in
   changing environments (i.e. an information primacy model). Animals work
   for earned food in order to update their estimate of a currently
   sub-optimal food source because, in the longer term, it may
   unpredictably become the optimal place to feed. Contrafreeloading is
   therefore a behaviour that, under natural conditions, is adaptive. (C)

Abstract = {{The efficacy of cardiovascular risk-reduction programs has been
   established. However the extent to,which risk-reduction interventions
   are effective may depend on adherence. Noncompliance, or non-adherence,
   may occur with any of the recommended or prescribed regimens and may
   vary across the treatment course. Compliance problems, whether occurring
   early or late in the treatment course, are clinically significant, as
   adherence is one mediator of the clinical outcome. This article, which
   is based on a review of the empirical literature of the past 20 years,
   addresses compliance across four regimens of cardiovascular risk
   reduction: pharmacological therapy, exercise, nutrition, and smoking
   cessation. The criteria for inclusion of a study in this review were:
   (a) focus on cardiovascular disease risk reduction; (b) report of a
   quantitative measure of compliance behavior; and (c) use of a randomized
   controlled design. Forty-sis studies meeting these criteria were
   identified A variety of self-report, objective, and electronic
   measurements methods were used across these studies. The interventions
   employed diverse combinations of cognitive, educational, and behavioral
   strategies to improve compliance in an array of settings. The strategies
   demonstrated to be successful in improving compliance included
   behavioral skill training, self-monitoring, telephone/mail contact
   self-efficacy enhancement, and external cognitive aids. A series of
   tables summarize the intervention strategies, compliance measures, and
   findings, as well as the interventions demonstrated to be successful.

Abstract = {{A 5-yr field study examined the ways in which prey abundance can
   influence the reproductive rates of predators. Water pythons (Liasis
   fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain in tropical Australia prey
   almost exclusively on dusky rats (Rattus colletti). Rat numbers varied
   dramatically among years of the study. Feeding rates of pythons were
   highest when rats were abundant, and the snakes were in good condition
   (mass relative to body length) at these times. The proportion of adult
   female pythons that reproduced in a given year was also tightly linked
   to rat abundances. However, reproductive output per litter (offspring
   size, and fecundity relative to maternal body size) was unaffected by
   prey availability, perhaps because of high fecundity-independent costs
   of reproduction. Instead, female pythons reproducing in `'good'' years
   were in better condition after oviposition.
   These data support an energy-limitation model for snake reproduction,
   whereby prey availability determines predator reproductive output, but
   the relationship between the two variables is complex. The degree to
   which prey availability influences feeding rates of pythons and the
   degree to which feeding rates influence body condition depend crucially
   on snake body size (due to size-related shifts in foraging abilities and
   metabolic costs). Thus, a given prey abundance translates into different
   energy reserves for different-sized predators. Also, females delay
   reproduction until they can gain enough energy for a large clutch of
   eggs, and reproductive output per litter does not then increase with
   additional energy availability. Such nonlinearities in predator
   responses to prey availability may be widespread.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that food supplementation for the generalist

   Cannibalism in these cohorts did not differ between food levels.

Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{450-458}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The study objectives are: (1) to examine and compare patterns
   of covariation of a wide range of health behaviors among adolescent boys
   and girls; (2) to determine whether eating behaviors are part of a
   larger construct of health-related behaviors and to identify the
   behaviors with which they share underlying similarities; and (3) to
   determine whether youth engaging in other health-compromising behaviors
   are at risk for unhealthy eating.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey,
   a classroom-administered questionnaire, completed by 36,284 adolescents,
   in grades 7-12 from 1986-87.
   Results: Among boys, factor analysis revealed five factors: (1)
   risk-taking behaviors, (2) school-related behaviors, (3) `'quietly''
   disturbed behaviors (e.g., frequent dieting, self-induced vomiting,
   suicide attempts), (4) health-promoting behaviors; and (5) exercise.
   Eating behaviors loaded on the construct of health-promoting behaviors
   with brushing teeth and seat belt use. Among girls, four similar factors
   emerged; however, exercise loaded on the construct of health-promoting
   behaviors. Therefore, eating behaviors loaded with brushing teeth, seat
   belt use, and exercise among girls. Logistic regression analyses,
   controlling for sociodemographic and personal variables, revealed that
   boys and girls engaging in health-promoting behaviors were less likely
   to have unhealthy eating behaviors, while those engaging in quietly
   disturbed behaviors, risk-taking behaviors, and problematic school
   behaviors were more likely to have unhealthy eating behaviors.
   Conclusions: Eating behaviors appear to be part of a health-promoting
   behavioral construct and should not be viewed in isolation from other
   behaviors. Although eating behaviors do not appear to be part of the
   `'problem behavior syndrome,'' youth engaging in a wine range of
   health-compromising behaviors are at risk for unhealthy eating;
   emphasizing the need to target high-risk youth with health promotion

Abstract = {{This study explored how baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, in a desert
   population trade off foraging and predation risk in patterns of habitat
   use. Four hypotheses were proposed and tested; that habitats are used on
   the basis of (1) availability, (2) foraging rewards (following the ideal
   free distribution), (3) foraging rewards modified by the constraints of
   nocturnal predation risk (partial trade-off) or (4) foraging rewards
   modified by the constraints of continuous predation risk (full
   trade-off). Food availability in each habitat was quantified through
   quadrat surveys describing stem density, plant part availability and
   nutrient availability (protein and energy) of key plant foods per unit
   area. Predation risk in each habitat was evaluated using measures
   describing the relative threat of attack and capture by both leopards,
   Panthera pardus, and lions, Panthera lee; attack risk was determined on
   the basis of habitat visibility and predator ambush distances, while
   capture risk was calculated using a simple model incorporating predator
   and prey velocities, habitat visibility and nearest refuge distance.
   Patterns of baboon behaviour were assessed for adult males and females
   in four groups through day-follows and instantaneous sampling. The
   baboons did not use habitats directly in proportion to their
   availability in the group's ranging area (in contrast to hypothesis 1).
   Nor did patterns of habitat use match those expected on the basis of the
   ideal free distribution, either during all activities (hypothesis 2) or
   during feeding (hypothesis 3). Instead, the baboons spent less time
   feeding in the high-risk food-rich habitat but more time feeding in the
   low-risk relatively food-poor habitat. Baboons also preferred low-risk
   habitats in other activities, where during resting and grooming all
   habitats were avoided except the safest (where key food species were
   absent). These results support hypothesis 4. Deviations from these
   patterns by a unimale group indicate that male reproductive strategies
   may also play a role in habitat selection. (C) 1997 The Association for

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Crucian carp Carassius carassius show great phenotypic plasticity in
   individual morphology and physiology, and strong variation in population
   density in different fish communities. Small fish with shallow bodies
   and large heads are typical in overcrowded monospecific fish communities
   in small ponds, whereas deep-bodied, large fish are found in larger,
   multispecies lakes. Crucian carp are especially vulnerable to predation
   by piscivorous fish and their greater relative body depth in
   multispecies fish communities has been proposed to be an induced defence
   against size-limited predation, and hence to be an adaptive feature.
   Data are presented here on the two divergent body forms in field
   populations in eastern Finland, together with results of laboratory
   experiments on predator effects on morphology and physiology (growth,
   respiration, heart rate). The deep body can be achieved in a few months
   by introducing a low population density of shallow-bodied fish into a
   food-rich environment with no piscivores. In the laboratory, both the
   presence of piscivores (chemical cues) and enhanced food availability
   increased the relative depth of crucian carp, but only to a modest
   extent when compared to natural variation. It is concluded that the
   deep-body form of crucian carp in the low density populations of
   multispecies fish communities is the normal condition. Reproduction in
   monospecific ponds results in high intraspecific competition, low growth
   rate and a stunted morphology. According to pilot tests, the mechanism
   behind the predator effect in the laboratory might be a behavioural
   reaction to chemical cues (alarm substances/predator odour) causing
   changes in energy allocation: predator-exposed crucian carp adopt a
   `hiding' mode with decreased activity (less swimming, lower respiration
   and heart rate) and with higher overall growth. Whether, and to what
   extent, this predator-induced mechanism works in nature is unclear. (C)

Abstract = {{Baboon, Papio cynocephalus, populations show a circumscribed range of

   daughter troops that result if fission occurs. Both the Drakensberg and
   the Amboseli populations were adequately described by the model and it
   is concluded that the distribution of troop size in both populations is
   governed by fission in the manner proposed by Dunbar (1992, Behav. Ecol.
   Sociobiol., 33, 35-49). The model also indicates that, relative to
   Amboseli, the probability of fission in the Drakensberg is very high,
   with all troops of more than 28 members eventually splitting. The
   hypothesis that low food availability accelerates fission in mountain
   baboons through the decreased foraging efficiency of larger troops was
   tested, Troops of a wide range of sizes allocated very similar amounts
   of time to foraging, foraged with the same efficiency, and travelled
   approximately the same distances to do so. It is concluded that fission
   in mountain baboons, being exacerbated neither by predation nor by
   inefficient foraging, may be caused directly by the inability of
   individuals to service social relationships in growing troops in the
   face of small amounts of time available for social interaction. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{This study tested whether female red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius
   phoeniceus, acquire non-genetic, material benefits from copulating with
   multiple males. In this population, females solicit extra-pair
   copulations, primarily from males defending adjacent territories on the
   same breeding marsh. Results of a feeder experiment revealed that
   females that copulated with an extra-pair male were allowed to feed on
   his territory, but females that remained faithful to their social mates
   were actively excluded from foraging on neighbouring territories. Males
   discriminated between faithful and unfaithful social mates. Females that
   engaged in extra-pair copulations were prevented from foraging on their
   social mate's territory significantly more often than females that did
   not. Measurement of neighbouring male responses to a mounted nest
   predator, a black-billed magpie, Pica pica, revealed that males were
   also significantly more aggressive towards a predator at a nest on a
   neighbouring territory if they had copulated with the breeding female
   than if they had not. These findings provide a possible explanation for
   results of Gray (1997, Anim. Behav., 53, 605-623), which showed that
   fledging success was significantly higher for females that engaged in
   extra-pair copulations than for females that did not, because
   depredation rates were significantly lower in clutches laid by females
   that had engaged in extra-pair copulations, and starvation rates tended
   to be lower in broods containing extra-pair young. This study is the
   first to demonstrate that females can benefit materially as well as
   genetically by copulating outside their pair bond and illustrates the
   need for manipulative tests to understand fully the reproductive
   strategies of individuals in populations where social relationships
   often do not reflect genetic relationships. (C) 1997 The Association for

Abstract = {{The damaging effects of fear on a number of performance indicators in
   poultry and other farm animals are becoming increasingly recognised.
   More specifically, there is growing evidence for a negative association
   between growth and fearfulness (an underlying behavioural
   characteristic). The present study examined this putative relationship
   in Japanese quail from two genetic fines that had been selected over
   several generations for low (LBW) or high (HBW) body weight at 4 weeks
   of age and in those of a non-selected control (CON) line. HEW quail were
   substantially heavier than LEW ones at 31 days of age (197 and 34 g,
   respectively), with CON birds occupying an intermediate (104 g)
   position. Birds were observed individually and once only between 26 and
   32 days of age in one of three putative tests of fear. Quail of the LEW
   line showed greater avoidance of a conspicuous novel object placed near
   the home cage and longer tonic immobility fear reactions, and they
   vocalized and struggled later and less often during brief mechanical
   restraint than did the HEW quail. Quail of the control line generally
   showed intermediate responses. Plasma corticosterone concentrations
   following mechanical restraint were greater in LEW quail than in CON or
   HEW ones. Consideration of the intra-individual correlations between
   behavioural and adrenocortical responses to restraint suggested that the
   nature of the relationship was labile and that it was sensitive to the
   background genome. Collectively, the present findings demonstrated that
   underlying fearfulness was greater in quail that had been genetically
   selected for low rather than high body Height. The present results
   thereby support the hypothesis that fearfulness and growth are
   negatively associated. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the effects of several aspects of
   transportation (movement to a novel environment, reduced space allowance
   and deprivation of food and water) on the behavioural and physiological
   responses of red deer. In two experiments conducted in winter and
   summer, two groups of five adult male castrated red deer (housed at a
   space allowance of 2.7 m(2) per deer) were subjected to either 3- or 6-h
   treatment periods (without food and water) at a reduced space allowance
   (0.9 m(2) per deer). The effect of ambient temperature (9 degrees C, 13
   degrees C and 20 degrees C) was also examined in the winter experiment.
   In both experiments, each of the two groups was subjected to one
   treatment combination per week, in a random order. The deer lost live
   weight during treatment periods, although the rate of loss decreased
   with time. In Experiment 1, there was a significantly larger increase in
   sodium concentration at the end of 6-h treatments than after 3-h
   treatments (1.73 versus 0.30 mmol l(-1), P < 0.05), although other
   measures of dehydration were not affected by either the length of
   treatment period or the ambient temperature. Neither plasma NEFA
   concentration nor plasma cortisol concentration were significantly
   affected by treatment periods. Proportionately more time was spent
   standing and moving during treatment periods, while less time was spent
   lying and grooming (all P < 0.05). Behavioural changes during treatment
   periods were short-lived, as all activities had returned to (or
   approached) baseline levels by 3 h after the treatment periods. In
   Experiment 1, a greater proportion of time was spent moving at the two
   higher temperatures, and there was more pen-directed activity during
   longer treatment periods (P < 0.05). There were only minor
   between-experiment differences, suggesting that seasonality was not a
   major influence on the animals' responses. It is concluded that any

Abstract = {{The polychaete worm Serpula vermicularis (Serpulidae) filter feeds at

   While in its tube, a worm is safe but cannot feed. Thus. hiding has a
   lost-opportunity cost. We show that this cost can be substantial, given
   that food in the natural habitat appears in pulses, and good feeding
   conditions may not last long or recur frequently. We expect that a
   worm's hiding time will be sensitive to the lost-opportunity cost, and
   we present data ft-om a series of experiments that support this
   prediction. The worms seem able to track relatively short-term changes
   in food availability, and some evidence suggests that they assess food
   availability on a relative basis, comparing current feeding conditions
   to those recently experienced. Hiding and other types of cryptic
   behavior are common antipredator tactical and animals may commonly
   adjust the durations of such behaviors to current benefits and costs

   subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg DZP or of the dissolution Vehicle
   from postnatal day (P) 2 to 21. Learning and memory were tested in
   P60-P70 rats on 5 consecutive days in a T maze and an eight arm maze
   while anxiety and reaction to novelty were tested in a 2 compartment box
   with a 2 step staircase on one side. Social behavior was evaluated in a
   condition of restricted access to food. LCMRglcs were measured at P60 by
   the quantitative autoradiographic {[}C-14]deoxyglucose method. In the T
   maze, when performed without delay between the 2 trials, the rate of
   alternation was significantly lower in DZP than in vehicle-exposed rats
   on the first 2 days of testing and similar in both groups on days 3-5.
   In the procedure with a 30 s intertrial delay, the rate of alternation
   was similar in DZP and vehicle-treated rats on all days of testing. In
   the eight arm maze, DZP-treated rats were more active, i.e. entering
   more arms per min than control animals. The number of arms entered
   before the first error was lower on day 1 and higher on day 3 in DZP
   compared to vehicle-exposed rats. In the 2 compartment box, DZP-treated
   rats crossed more often the lower step of the staircase and spent more
   time than controls on the 2 steps of the staircase while control rats
   made more rearings than DZP-exposed rats in the well protected corner of
   the box. LCMRglcs were decreased by early DZP exposure in several
   cortical regions, mammillary body, septum and dorsomedian caudate
   nucleus; in conclusion, an early chronic DZP treatment induces an
   increase inactivity only a delay but no impairment in learning and leads
   to a decrease in the level of anxiety and emotionality leading to an
   active response to novelty. These quite subtle behavioral changes are
   accompanied by discrete metabolic changes and probably reflect the state
   of hyperactivity/hyperarousal of these animals which could result from a
   change in the distribution, the sensitivity and/or function of GABA-BZD

Abstract = {{In reflecting upon insecticides and their use, it is easy to dwell on
   their well-documented problems as environmental pollutants and nontarget
   toxicants. Yet very few chemical industries have been as responsive or
   as innovative as the agrochemical companies in providing society with
   new and novel compounds that have allowed us to produce and protect the
   high quality food and fiber necessary to feed and clothe an ever
   increasing human population. Given the effectiveness and wide-spread use
   of insecticides, it was naive not to have envisioned the environmental
   impacts that these chemicals have caused. Nevertheless, the impacts of
   insecticide use have resulted in a much more complete and rigorous
   understanding of the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of environmental
   contaminants, their environmental fate and degradative processes, and an
   increased insight on mechanisms leading to acquired drug tolerance and
   resistance. Such understanding would certainly not have been possible
   without the explicit structure-activity relationships provided by
   insecticidal chemicals. The availability of homologous series of
   insecticidal analogues, toxic and nontoxic insecticidal enantiomers, and
   radiolabeled insecticides have provided us with invaluable tools in the
   elucidation of how insecticides bind receptors and ultimately produce
   their toxic response. Pesticide science owes a debt of gratitude to the
   agrochemical industry for making these compounds readily available to
   environmental researchers and academic scientists alike.
   In this review, I examine the mode of action studies of three
   structurally dissimilar insecticides on the nervous system. These
   insecticides are DDT, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon that acts as a
   nerve toxin by modifying the kinetics of voltage-dependent ion channels
   associated with the neurolemma; deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethrin
   analog that acts in a similar fashion as DDT; and azinphosmethyl, a
   phosphorodithioate organophosphate that acts as nerve toxin by
   competitively inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (Fig. 1). The activity of
   these insecticides are assessed using three functional assays: (i) the
   enhanced release of neurotransmitters from isolated presynaptic nerve
   terminals; (ii) the behavioral and mortality responses of the ciliate
   organism, Paramecium; and (iii) the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
   associated with azinphosmethyl resistance in Colorado potato beetle. In
   each case, I summarize our findings in terms of the future benefit that
   they may provide. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Polygyny appears to be beneficial for males, yet comprises less than
   20\% of all pair bonds formed by male willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus.
   This study tested whether polygyny was costly to males. Polygynous males
   defended larger territories than monogamous and unpaired males and were
   more likely to be adults than males of other pairing status. Pairing
   status changed throughout the life of some males. Naturally polygynous
   males were in better body condition in the early part of the breeding
   season than other male types, and unpaired territorial males had the
   lowest condition. Naturally polygynous males had a tendency to lose the
   least amount of body mass over the season. Naturally polygynous and
   monogamous males had larger combs than males of other pairing status.
   Polygynous males had higher reproductive success, similar survival and
   similar future reproductive success compared with monogamous and
   unpaired territorial males. Even in years of high clutch predation, and
   accounting for higher levels of extra-pair paternity in the clutches of
   polygynous males, naturally polygynous males were more successful than
   other male types. A group of experimentally polygynous males (i.e. they
   became polygynous because of a male removal experiment) had similar
   reproductive success to naturally polygynous males, but lower overwinter
   survival than other male types. These results suggest that naturally
   polygynous males were older and `better' than other males and this
   allowed them to defend larger territories and attract more than one
   female. Males that became polygynous only as a result of our experiment,
   however, appeared to suffer costs from this increased breeding effort.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Trophic breadth may be correlated with behavioural and functional
   versatility or flexibility (Liem 1984), such that species with limited
   diets would be predicted to be less versatile or flexible in their
   feeding capabilities than would trophic generalists. The relationship
   was examined between the trophic breadth of a species and the degree to
   which muscle activity is influenced by prey type in two species of
   pufferfishes: Chilomycterus schoepfi, a specialist on hard-shelled prey,
   and Sphoeroides nephalus, a generalist predator. It was predicted that
   the specialist would show a decreased ability to alter its motor pattern
   in response to prey type and an increased amount of motor-pattern
   variability when feeding on different prey.
   2. Electromyographic recordings of five feeding muscles were made from
   five individuals per species feeding on four prey types that differed in
   their hardness and escape abilities. Muscle-activity duration, relative
   onset and integrated rectified area were analysed for prey capture and
   manipulation behaviours for each prey type,
   3. Prey-type effects on mean motor-pattern variables for capture were
   limited to one of 14 variables in each species. Prey effects on buccal
   manipulation were not significant for any of the 14 variables for C.
   schoepfi, but S. nephalus exhibited prey effects for seven out of 14
   variables. No differences in motor-pattern variation were found for the
   strike, but-species differed significantly in overall motor-pattern
   variability during buccal manipulation; C. schoepfi, the dietary
   specialist, exhibited greater motor variability than S. nephalus, the
   dietary generalist.
   4. The results therefore support a direct relationship between the
   trophic breadth of a species and its functional versatility for buccal
   manipulation. In contrast, prey capture was a relatively stereotyped
   behaviour for both species, as few prey-type effects were found.}},

Abstract = {{Many passerines wintering in temperate regions rely on their energy
   reserves for survival during periods when foraging is not possible.
   Excessive fat reserves, however, increase body mass and thus reduce
   agility and speed in flight, imposing a survival cost when the bird
   tries to escape from predators. If fat reserves reflect a trade-off
   between starvation and predation risks, the size of reserves could be
   expected to vary with the perceived level of predation risk. The
   hypothesis that increasing the relative risk of predation results in
   decreased body mass was tested experimentally using captive
   greenfinches, Carduelis chloris. Greenfinches show winter fattening and
   take flight when disturbed and are therefore suitable for testing the
   hypothesis. The perceived predation risk, a stuffed predator moved in
   the birds' environment, resulted in lower body mass. Handling the birds
   had the same effect. These results support theoretical predictions and
   some field data regarding the adjustment of body mass to variation in
   the predation risk. They further suggest, in line with other studies,
   that birds are able to change body mass in response to proximate
   factors.

Abstract = {{Classical software reliability research has tended to focus on
   behavioral-type failures which typically manifest themselves as
   incorrect or missing outputs. In real-time software, a correct output
   which is not produced within a specified response time interval may also
   constitutes a failure. As a result, response time failures must also be
   taken into account when real-time software reliability is assessed.
   Response-time requirements can be stated in a hard or a soft form, The
   latter form is often preferred wizen the quality of service offered is
   of concern. fn a number of real-time applications, the responses to a
   particular stimulus are highly state dependent and, therefore, the
   response time requirements must be predicated on state.
   This paper considers the case where the detection of response times
   failures is done by a separate unit which observes the inputs and
   outputs of the target software. Automatic detection of such failures is
   complicated by state dependencies which require the unit to track a
   target's state as well as the elapsed times between specified stimulus
   and response pairs. A novel, black-box approach is described for
   detecting response time failures and quality of service degradations of
   session-oriented, real-time software.
   The behavior of the target software is assumed to be specified in a
   formalism based on the notion of communicating extended finite state
   machines. The response time failure detection unit, implemented
   independently of the target software, interprets a formal model derived
   directly from the target's requirement specifications. The model is used
   both to track the state of the target and to determine when to start and
   stop time interval timing measurements. Measurements of multiple
   response time intervals may occur simultaneously. The approach was
   evaluated on the call processing program of a small telephone exchange
   Some results of the evaluation are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined whether gender differences in health
   behaviors can be partly explained by gender differences in avoidant
   coping. One-hundred and thirty-three college undergraduate students
   responded to a coping questionnaire to assess cognitive avoidance. In
   addition, participants completed measures of health -behaviors.
   Generally women scored higher than men on self-care, vehicle safety, and
   drug avoidance, but not on physical exercise and healthy nutrition.
   Women exhibited lower cognitive avoidance than men. Gender differences
   in vehicle safety and drug avoidance were due to men who scored high on
   cognitive avoidance. Considering the nature of the different health
   behaviors examined, it is conceivable that some are more instrumental
   than others with respect to self-enhancement. For instance, reckless
   driving and excessive alcohol consumption may be perceived as
   self-enhancing by highly avoidant men.}},

Abstract = {{Species differ greatly in the breadth of their environmental

   explore how in the same collection of habitats some species may be
   limited by trade-offs to occupying only one habitat, while other species
   may face no trade-off between habitats and therefore be able to
   generalize in their habitat use. Food web interactions define the
   available niches within a habitat. Changes in food web structure cause
   some niches to be lost and replaced by other niches as one moves between
   habitats. Species occupying these niches will have more limited habitat
   distributions. However, other niches may be available in the food web
   structures of multiple habitats, and species occupying these niches will

Abstract = {{1. In this study we investigated sources of variation in growth rate and
   survival in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara.
   2. We conducted two experiments to identify factors that explain the
   pattern of geographic variation of life-history traits in this species.
   In the first experiment, we raised hatchlings from two French
   populations of L. vivipara, located at low (150 m) and high (1400 m)
   altitudes, under identical laboratory conditions. The hatchlings grew at
   the same rate when experiencing the same environmental conditions
   irrespective of their origin. This finding suggests that the observed
   differences in growth rate between these two populations of L. vivipara
   are driven by environmental factors (e.g. thermal environment) rather
   than genetic divergence. Although we did not find any genetic difference
   between populations, we found some evidence of within-population
   variation in growth rate.
   3. In a second experiment, we raised hatchlings from the high altitude
   population in outdoor enclosures located at low and high altitudes. The
   site where hatchlings were raised had a large impact on both growth and
   survival. Lizards located in the low altitude site grew faster and had a
   higher mortality rate than lizards located in the high altitude site.
   These findings are consistent with the observed differences in growth
   and survival between the natural populations inhabiting the two
   localities,
   4. In spite of the low statistical power of the models used to detect
   the family x environment interactions, we found a marginally significant
   interaction for survival (P = 0.054), which suggests that phenotypic
   plasticity of this trait may have some degree of genetic variance.
   5. Finally, we did not find any evidence for a genetic correlation
   between growth and survival in the high altitude population. This
   suggests that the observed phenotypic trade-off between the two traits
   may arise from environmental constraints (e.g. more active lizards have
   higher growth rates but also have higher risks of predation).
   6. Overall, our findings emphasize that environmental factors may play a
   major role in shaping patterns of life-history association in L.
   vivipara, and in explaining geographic variation of life histories.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, tests of risk-sensitive foraging involve observing a
   subject's choices of alternative prey types differing in some
   combination of mean and variance of expected foraging gain. Here, we
   consider the problem of risk-sensitive foraging when there is a single
   prey type. We observed worker bumble bees (Bombus occidentalis) foraging
   in an array of artificial 2-flower inflorescences. After visiting the
   bottom flower in an inflorescence and obtaining a reward of some size,
   the bee decides whether to visit the top flower or to move to a new
   inflorescence (a patch departure). Here, risk-sensitive behavior is
   expressed as the forager's choice of patch departure threshold (PDT) of
   reward obtained in the bottom flower. We measured the PDTs of bees whose
   colony energy stores (and therefore energy requirements) had been
   manipulated (Enhanced or Depleted). Simulations led us to predict that
   shortfall-minimizing bees should decrease their PDTs when their colony
   energy reserves were depleted, relative to when the reserves were
   enhanced. Bees did not use a strict patch departure threshold, but
   instead the probability of departure varied with nectar volume in the
   bottom flower. Colony energy stores did affect patch departure behavior,
   but this effect was confounded by the order in which manipulation of
   colony reserves was applied, Further, simulations of observed bee patch
   departure decisions did not produce behavior expected if the decisions
   were based on shortfall-minimization. We conclude that a bee's decision
   of when to leave an inflorescence is not predicted by a static
   shortfall-minimizing model. Our results also implicate an important
   interaction between learning and foraging requirements. We review
   risk-sensitivity in bees, and discuss why risk-sensitive foraging may be
   adaptive for bumble bees.}},

   concerned with modelling the risk-sensitive behaviour exhibited by an

   that, in maximising survival probability, risk-averse behaviour is much
   more important than risk-prone behaviour. I also argue that animals in
   the laboratory will continue to use rules which are adapted to food
   sources which change over time. A model of environmental change is
   investigated. This model predicts that a consequence of change is that
   less risk-prone behaviour than that predicted by standard models is to
   be expected in laboratory studies. The need to learn about a stochastic
   food source in a changing environment is predicted to further reduce the
   incidence of risk-prone behaviour. It is difficult to learn about highly
   variable food sources. This is shown to lead to risk-aversion even when
   the optimisation criterion is maximisation of mean long-term rate of
   food gain.

Abstract = {{We compare the (relative) abundance of life phases {[}juveniles (JU),
   initial phase (IF) and terminal phase (TP) fish], social categories
   (territorial and group adults), and fish following alternative mating
   styles, in three local populations of the protogynous reef herbivore,
   Sparisoma viride, on the fringing reef of Bonaire (Netherlands
   Antilles). In order to determine the adaptive significance of variations
   in social organization, they are related to the density of conspecifics
   and other herbivores and to the availability of food, shelter and mating
   sites. The most striking difference is the high abundance of JU and
   group fish at one location (Playa Frans) and the total absence of group
   fish at another (Red Slave). These differences are coherent with a
   gradient in population density, total herbivore density, scarid grazing
   pressure, and reproductive output, all of which are highest at Playa
   Frans and lowest at Red Slave. Exposure to waves and currents shows an
   inverse trend. The differences in the relative abundance of territorial
   fish can be explained by the concept of economic defendability, which is
   reduced at higher population density. In a life history context, small
   TP group males represent `bachelors' that sacrifice current reproduction
   for better future prospects. As predicted by life history theory, early
   sex change is promoted at sites where the future rewards are higher
   (higher spawning rates of large TP males) and where the costs incurred
   during the bachelor phase are reduced (more spawning opportunities for
   group TP males). At Red Slave an alternative male mating style
   ('streaking') appears to be promoted by the lack of a refuge for group
   TP males and by a dense gorgonian canopy, allowing IP males to reside
   inside territories. We conclude that most observed differences in
   population structure can be considered adaptive in an ecological and in
   a life history context. Population density is a major factor in both
   contexts. Analysis of the variability in adult density in relation to JU
   density and the availability of food and shelter indicates that the S.
   viride populations at Bonaire are not totally controlled by stochastic
   processes. Considering the small spatial scale and the high dispersal of
   the planktonic embryos and larvae, the observed variability in
   behavioural and life history traits of S. viride points to a high degree

Abstract = {{This study examines the behavioral responses of larvae of the American
   toad, Bufo americanus, to the presence of an invertebrate predator,
   larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius. In particular, we examine whether
   responses to predators are categorical ones to some threshold level of
   predation risk or alternatively whether the responses are adjustable
   depending on the level of predation risk. If the responses are graded,
   does the response vary according to what cues about predation risk are
   available to prey? Because avoiding predation can incur costs in terms
   of resource acquisition, does food availability affect the responses of
   toad larvae to their predators? Finally, because predation risk is a
   function of body size, we also examined whether the response to predator
   presence was affected by size of toad larvae. We addressed these
   questions by measuring the activity levels and habitat use of toad
   larvae in the presence and absence of predators while manipulating
   predator density, whether the predators had fed, food availability, and
   larval toad size. In an additional experiment, we also measured activity
   and movement speed of toad larvae when we manipulated food availability
   and predator density. We found that toad larvae were less active as
   predator density increased and as food availability increased. Small
   toad larvae were more sensitive to the presence of predators than were
   large larvae. Although toad larvae did reduce activity by 35\% in the
   presence of fed predators as opposed to unfed predators, the result was
   not statistically significant. Toad larvae did avoid predators, but the
   level of avoidance could not be shown to vary with predator density,
   food availability, or body size. However, there was a borderline effect
   of predator feeding status. Movement speed was not significantly related

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural responses are of increasing
   interest in the behavioural sciences. There could be enormous benefits
   for animal husbandry if a test could be developed that would identify
   categories or types of individuals unlikely to cope with subsequent
   challenges. The present study compared the behavioural responses of two
   series of 16 groups (n = 6 or 7 gilts) under four different
   circumstances: Situation 1, an open field with a novel stimulus (bucket
   or human); Situation 2, individual access to food for 15 min after a
   20-h period of food deprivation; Situation 3, competition for food after
   food deprivation; Situation 4, general activity and feeding behaviour in
   a group over a 24-h period. Situations 1 and 2 were assessed four and
   three times over a 2- and 1-week period, respectively. Both showed high
   levels of consistency in the behavioural responses of the gilts.
   Principal component analyses were used to reduce the number of variables
   per test situation and facilitate measurement of consistency across test
   situations. The amount of variation explained by the first component was
   generally more than twice that explained by any subsequent components.
   The only significant correlation between factor scores calculated from
   the first components was found between Situations 1 and 2 in the first
   series. None of the calculated factor scores showed bi- or multimodal
   distributions. We conclude that, whilst over a short period of time
   gilts respond consistently to a specific challenge, they do not display
   the same consistency when challenged in a different context. This lack
   of inter-situation correlations, plus the absence of multimodal
   distributions, fails to support the view that behavioural `types' of

Abstract = {{The influence of moonlight on the foraging behaviour of the scorpion
   Buthus occitanus israelis was observed. In contrast to their visual
   predators, most scorpions use air and surface vibrations to locate their
   prey. Therefore, moonlight is not likely to have a direct effect on the
   scorpions' foraging behaviour, but rather an indirect effect through
   changes in risk from predation or changes in prey availability. Adult
   scorpions were less active on moonlit nights than on dark nights, and
   adults that were active on full moon nights tended to ambush under
   bushes. Juveniles, however, did not seem to alter their activity as a
   response to moonlight. Mass-to-size ratios of adult scorpions foraging
   on moonlit nights were significantly lower than those of scorpions
   foraging on dark nights, suggesting that scorpions that forage in bright
   moonlight are individuals with relatively low energy reserves. The
   results are consistent with the hypothesis that risk of predation is
   higher during periods of bright moonlight. It is suggested that the
   scorpions use environmental factors such as illumination and humidity as
   proximal cues, to evaluate levels of predation risk and food
   availability. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{In the hatchery environment, there is no selection by predators against
   risky foraging behaviour and excessive aggressiveness. Consequently,
   hatchery-reared trout should have a higher competitive ability and a
   less pronounced antipredator response than wild trout. Growth hormone
   increases the energy demand and thereby the feeding motivation of an
   animal. Therefore, growth hormone injections should reduce the
   antipredator response and promote competitive ability. Both hatchery
   selection and growth hormone injection consistently reduced antipredator
   behavioural responses in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the
   presence of a trout predator. However, neither hatchery selection nor
   growth hormone had any effect on dominance or quantity of contested food
   consumed, whereas both hatchery selection and growth hormone injection
   promoted growth. RNA levels were increased by growth hormone, and
   hatchery-reared trout had lower RNA levels than wild trout. The presence
   of the predator increased RNA levels in the trout independent of strain
   and treatment. Our study suggests that antipredator behaviour, growth
   rate, and resource allocation patterns in brown trout change rapidly as
   a consequence of hatchery selection and that similar changes in
   antipredator behaviour can be induced by increasing GH levels. Thus,
   released or escaped hatchery-reared fish or fish with manipulated growth

Abstract = {{Facultative paedomorphosis in salamanders occurs when larvae respond to
   varying environmental conditions by either metamorphosing into
   terrestrial metamorphic adults or retaining their larval morphology to
   become sexually mature paedomorphic adults. Several hypotheses have been
   proposed for the evolutionary maintenance of this environmentally
   induced dimorphism, but few data are available to assess them
   adequately. We studied a montane population of the tiger salamander,
   Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum, and measured the adult growth rate and
   body condition across three growing seasons to assess the relative costs
   and benefits of each morph. Metamorphic adults grew more than
   paedomorphic adults in terms of snout-vent length across years and in
   weight within years. Dietary analyses and foraging experiments revealed
   some of the proximate factors that may underlie these differential
   growth patterns. Across all prey, metamorphs had significantly higher
   biomass and calories per stomach sample than paedomorphs. Metamorphic
   diets primarily consisted of the fairy shrimp Branchinecta coloradensis,
   whereas paedomorphic diets contained a variety of benthic and
   terrestrial invertebrates. Foraging experiments revealed that both
   morphs are more successful at capturing fairy shrimp relative to other
   prey types and both show high electivity toward this prey. However,
   fairy shrimp occurred only in non-permanent ponds and thus are
   inaccessible to paedomorphs, which can survive only in permanent ponds.
   Paedomorphs also experience higher levels of intraspecific competition
   with large larvae in permanent ponds than metamorphs do in non-permanent
   ponds. Thus, metamorphs obtain a growth advantage over paedomorphs by
   foraging in non-permanent ponds that contain fairy shrimp and have
   reduced intraspecific competition. These results suggest that
   paedomorphs should have decreased fitness relative to metamorphs,
   primarily because metamorphs can move into the best habitats for growth.
   The net fitness effect of morph-specific differences in dispersal depend
   on whether there are trade-offs with other life history traits.
   Nonetheless, because the relative benefit of metamorph dispersal will
   change with environmental conditions in permanent ponds and the
   surrounding habitat, the relative fitness payoff to each morph should
   track changes in the environment. Thus, facultative paedomorphosis may
   be maintained in part by variable, environmentally-specific fitness
   payoffs to each morph.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the organisation of behaviour, the responses to chemical

   (a) odour of a predator elicited an increase in locomotion; (b) odour of
   food also elicited an increase in locomotion; (c) odour resulting from
   snail predation (a signal of availability of an empty shell) elicited
   brief grasps of the shells of other crabs and (d) the odour of

   Individual crabs differed significantly in their tendencies to respond

   strongly to other cues. Those responding to one shell-related cue (snail

   Combinations of cues yielded examples of both summation of inputs (rate

   inhibition of the responses to one input by the detection of the second
   odour (brief grasps typical of the response to snail odour were
   eliminated by addition of predator odour). Responses to conspecific

Abstract = {{Optimum reproductive efficiency of farmed deer is often constrained by
   apparent maladaptation of wild cervids to a given farm environment or
   components of that environment. Seasonal breeding amongst forest-fringe
   species of northern temperate origin (e.g. red deer, fallow deer)
   benefits the species within its natural range, but often creates
   misalignment in southern temperate zones between the high nutritional
   demands of lactation in summer and the earlier peak of pasture
   production and quality occurring in spring. This can lead to increased
   calf mortality, decreased calf growth rates and depressed dam
   liveweights. Much emphasis has been placed on manipulating either
   pasture production patterns or the timing of birth to create better
   synchrony between the two. The latter largely involves artificial
   manipulation of the timing of conceptions (e.g. melatonin treatment),
   but there may also be options for genetic selection of deer for earlier
   calving patterns. Tropical cervid species farmed in temperate
   environments can exhibit either a seasonal reproduction (e.g. chital
   deer) or autumn-wintering calving patterns (e.g. rusa deer), leading to
   high mortality of neonates (hypothermia, predation) under uncontrolled
   breeding management. However, there are simple management options to
   synchronise and shift calving patterns to better align tropical species
   to temperate environments.
   The effects of chronic and acute stress on reproductive efficiency of
   farmed deer are often discussed but seldom demonstrated. Many farmed
   deer populations exhibit high pregnancy rates (i.e. > 90\% females
   pregnant), indicating robust reproductive physiology and general
   habituation to the farmed habitat. Low reproductive rates of pubertal
   red deer hinds in some herds may be partly indicative of the effects of
   chronic stress, although other factors such as social facilitation and
   nutrition cannot be discounted.
   While species of cervids that are used for farming generally display a
   high degree of behavioural plasticity, the farm environment and
   associated management practices may impinge on important components of
   the social environment. Thus, practices such as controlled breeding
   (e.g. single-sire mating) and confinement during calving may have
   effects on reducing overall reproductive potential by disrupting social
   processes (e,g. dam-calf bonds). This highlights the paucity of
   knowledge on the complexities of cervid behaviour and their implications
   in both wild and farmed deer.}},

   The extent of prey morphological transformation and therefore the

   cost which may be a significant part of the whole cell budget, at least
   when food is in short supply. Not only the morphological transformation
   but also the maintenance of the anti-predator phenotype were
   energetically costly for Euplotes, the cost being proportional to the
   defence level. The morphological transformation was affected by the kind
   of food (algae) provided to the prey. Ciliates fed Chlorogonium

Abstract = {{Two fundamental questions in the study of cooperatively breeding birds
   are (1) do auxiliaries increase the reproductive success of a flock, and
   (2) if so, how? This paper addresses these questions in the
   white-throated magpie-jay, Calocitta formosa. This social corvid was
   studied for three consecutive breeding seasons in Santa Rosa National
   Park, Costa Rica. Detailed information was gathered on 16 breeding
   flocks attending a total of 56 active nests. Auxiliaries were divided
   into three classes depending on their residency patterns and relative
   contributions to the breeding effort. The influence of auxiliaries was
   examined on eight measures of nesting success, and on five factors that
   influence reproductive outcome in this population: (1) onset of first
   laying, (2) predation, (3) hatching failure, (4) clutch desertion and
   (5) starvation. The results support three major conclusions. First,
   helpers directly enhanced nesting success at every stage in the nesting
   cycle. Second, all helpers did not help equally. Flock size alone bore
   no relationship to nesting success, but both the number of full-time
   helpers and helper score (a weighted measure of auxiliary contributions)
   were significantly related to reproductive outcome. Third, helpers
   increased breeding success by hastening the onset of first laying,
   reducing predation on eggs and chicks, and decreasing hatching failure;
   helpers did not affect the incidence of clutch desertion or chick
   starvation. These findings provide strong quantitative support for the
   anti-predator hypothesis and provide the first unequivocal evidence that
   helpers can enhance nest success by increasing hatchability. (C) 1996

   piglets. Piglets risk being crushed if they are underneath the sow as
   she lies down, but they may benefit from staying close to the sow by
   improving their access to teats during nursings and by increasing milk
   production. The prediction was tested that piglets with relatively low
   weight gains, and thus in greatest need of energy or nutrients, would
   spend more time in close proximity to the sow and therefore assume a
   higher mortality risk from crushing. Piglets (N = 138 from 17 litters)
   were highly variable in birth weight, weight gain, and the amount of
   time they spent in the risky area underneath a standing or sitting sow.
   As predicted, piglets that had gained less weight spent more time in
   this risky area. The relationship held both within and between litters,
   and was largely because poor-gaining piglets spent more time actively
   nuzzling the sow's udder, an activity that may increase milk production
   of a teat. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

   studies on the behavioural responses of early life stages of walleye
   pollock, Theragra chalcogramma to key environmental factors including

   the behaviour of individual fish depends on the integration of a
   continually changing hierarchy of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
   with the relative importance of a specific factor varying with ontogeny
   and over time and space. The broad range of responses displayed by early
   life stages suggests that behaviour plays an important role in
   determining the consequences of environmental variability on walleye

Abstract = {{The effects of reduced food availability on the behavior of juvenile
   walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma were examined in laboratory
   experiments designed to test for potential energy-conserving responses.
   Groups of juvenile fish were held on 1 of 6 ration treatments ranging
   from ad libitum to near starvation, and then vertical distribution and
   activity levels were quantified in a 2.5 m deep water column under
   isothermal and thermally stratified conditions. Stratification resulted
   in a general shift to the upper, warmer layer in the 2 experiments
   employing a sharp thermocline at mid-depth, but the occurrence of fish
   in the colder bottom layer varied with different ration treatments.
   Movement into cold water increased in intermediate ration groups
   compared to high ration groups. Since reduced temperatures should reduce
   metabolic costs, this behavior is consistent with our hypothesis that
   food deprivation should invoke energy-saving behaviors. However,
   activity levels increased for fish held on intermediate rations,
   suggesting that the greater movement into cold water was a corollary
   result of increased searching for food. Fish in the lowest ration
   treatments had decreased activity levels, but also decreased their
   movement into cold water when a sharp thermocline was present, negating
   potential bioenergetic benefits. In the third experiment, there was a
   gradual thermal gradient from surface to bottom rather than a sharp
   thermocline. Temperatures associated with vertical positions of the fish
   were determined. In this experiment, clear energy-conserving responses
   to temperature were displayed by food-deprived fish; the average
   temperatures occupied by fish on starvation rations were 3 to 4 degrees
   C colder than those of the higher ration groups. Based on the high Q(10)
   for metabolic rates of juvenile pollock, these reduced temperatures
   potentially conferred energy savings of up to 34\%, relative to the
   metabolic expenditures of fish on high rations. The contrast in behavior
   for the lowest ration groups between sharply stratified and gradually
   stratified conditions suggested that the severity of the temperature
   gradient influenced the fishes' ability to take advantage of cold water
   as an energetic refuge. The behavior of fish in the laboratory was
   consistent with prior observations in the Bering Sea, where juvenile
   walleye pollock remained in surface waters if food availability was
   high, but initiated vertical migration into deeper, colder water with
   reduced prey densities. Results of this study demonstrated a broad
   flexibility in the behavioral mechanisms used by walleye pollock to deal
   with declining food levels. The initial response to food limitation was
   increased activity, indicative of greater searching behavior. With
   extended food deprivation, a switch to energy-conserving behavior was
   evident. The temperature responses of fish experiencing severe food
   limitation provided support for a bioenergetic hypothesis of diel
   vertical migration.}},

   of colony members(4,6) with the prediction that caste ratios should vary
   with environmental factors such as predation, competition and food
   availability. However, because it has been difficult to manipulate
   experimentally the environmental factors believed to influence optimal
   caste ratio, demonstration of adaptive caste distribution has remained
   elusive(7-10). Here we show that colonies of the ant Pheidole pallidula

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that endogenous opioid systems (i.e.

   mediated reductions in pain sensitivity, or, more appropriately,
   nociceptive sensitivity (latency of a foot-lifting response to a 50
   degrees C thermal surface), are evident in laboratory mice, Mus musculus
   domesticus, exposed to biting flies. Similar opioid-mediated reductions
   in pain sensitivity (opioid analgesia) are also seen after exposure to a
   variety of other natural stressors such as the threat of predation.
   Here, we demonstrate that brief (30-min) exposure of male mice to stable
   flies, Stomoxys calcitrans, significantly and synergistically augments
   either the concurrent or subsequent (60 min after fly exposure)
   analgesic effects induced by exposure to a predator (cat odour). These

Abstract = {{Laboratory rats, like many other animal species, transport food, Their
   behavior is influenced by factors such as food size, the time required
   to eat, travel distance, travel difficulty, and the availability of
   cover, etc. Recent versions of optimal foraging theory suggest that
   species that display such behavioral patterns do so in order to minimize
   risk to predation while at the same time maximizing food gain.
   Nevertheless, it is not clear that this explanation applies to rats, nor
   is it easy to investigate this problem in a laboratory. The results of
   the present study on urban feral rats show that their food handling
   behavior is similar to that of domestic rats, The results also suggest
   that food carrying can serve defensive as well as communicative
   functions, Aggression around food sources was high, Smaller rats always
   carried food and some large rats infrequently carried food, suggesting
   that the food carrying by smaller, subordinate rats may help them avoid
   conspecific aggression. The rats also vigorously attempted to steal food
   that was carried home by conspecifics. This result suggests that food
   carrying can redistribute food resources and inform conspecifics about
   food availability, The results demonstrate the utility of multilevel
   behavioral analysis and also demonstrate that for rats, food transport
   has functions other than predator avoidance, including avoidance of
   conspecific aggression and communication about food availability. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examines the non-lethal effects of an odonate predator (Anax
   junius) on the competitive interactions among several size classes of

   estimated the effects of both large and small bullfrogs (Rana
   catesbeiana) on themselves, on each other, and on small green frogs (R.
   clamitans) in the absence and non-lethal (caged) presence of Anax. The
   presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small
   bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had
   positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large
   bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship
   of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass
   competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much
   greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax
   significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small
   bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the
   small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax.
   Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across
   experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes
   in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of
   the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had
   substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this

   effects in the study of ecological communities; Our results also
   illustrate the futility of attempting to partition the effects of
   competitors and predators, as both competitors and the non-lethal
   presence of predators significantly affected growth rates and death by
   starvation of small larvae. Finally, our results illustrate how
   individual behavioral responses may be translated to community and

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, have
   strong effects on the activity, habitat use, social interactions and
   mating dynamics of a stream-dwelling water strider, Aquarius remigis
   (family Gerridae, hence, gerrids). In nature, however, stream pools
   often contain not just sunfish and water striders, but also smaller fish
   such as minnows. Here, we used factorial experiments in seminatural
   streams to document the direct and indirect effects of sunfish and
   fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, on water strider survival and
   behavior. Sunfish, minnows and gerrids all consume surface prey (here,
   crickets); thus these three species are potential food competitors.
   Sunfish eat minnows. Accordingly, the presence of sunfish caused minnows
   to increase their schooling behavior and shift their activity from the
   surface toward the bottom substrate. The presence of sunfish was also
   associated with an increase in the number of missing gerrids, whereas
   minnows caused relatively little gerrid disappearance. Most
   interestingly, the presence of minnows decreased the effect of sunfish
   on gerrid disappearance rates; that is, minnows apparently had an
   indirect positive effect on water strider survival. We suggest that this
   indirect positive effect reflects the fact that minnows are alternative
   prey for sunfish. The effects of sunfish and minnows on gerrid mortality
   explained the influence of these fish on gerrid behavior. Sunfish caused
   decreases in male gerrid activity, female availability, mating activity,
   mating frequency and mating duration. Larger males had a mating
   advantage over smaller males only in pools with sunfish and no minnows.
   Sunfish also caused a borderline significant decrease in the large
   female mating advantage. These results were all observed in previous
   studies and can be viewed as adaptive responses to predation risk. These
   patterns were not consistent with the expected effects of sunfish as
   food competitors with water striders. In contrast, minnows had
   relatively Little influence on water strider behavior and the few
   significant effects were the opposite of those of sunfish. Minnows
   caused increases in female activity and in mating duration, a decrease
   in the large male mating advantage and an increase in the large female
   mating advantage. These patterns fit the view that minnows caused an
   increase in gerrid hunger, i.e., that minnows acted as food competitors
   with gerrids. Finally, planned contrasts against controls showed that,
   in the presence of both sunfish and minnows, water striders showed no
   significant behavioral responses to fish (i.e., gerrid behavior in pools
   with sunfish and minnows did not significantly differ from behavior in
   fishless pools). The most likely mechanism explaining this pattern is a
   dilution of sunfish predation risk due to the presence of minnows
   serving as alternative prey for sunfish.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major goals of an ecomorphological analysis is to correlate
   patterns of interspecific differences in morphology with patterns of
   interspecific differences in ecology. Information derived from
   functional morphological studies may provide a mechanistic framework
   supporting the correlation, but the move from a correlational
   relationship to a causal relationship requires experimental evidence
   that the interspecific morphological differences create performance
   differences and therefore ecological differences. The goal of this study
   was to examine ecomorphological relationships in the diets of cottid
   fishes (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae) from the northeastern Pacific by
   using functional classifications of predators (based on their mode of
   attack) and of prey (based on their anti-predator defenses). The
   proposed ecomorphological relationships were tested by examining capture
   success among the cottids in attacks on prey with different escape
   abilities. As predicted on functional morphological grounds, both
   multivariate and univariate analyses indicated that the gravimetric
   importance of `elusive prey' (i.e. fishes, shrimp, mysids, and octopods)
   was greater in cottid species with a larger relative mouth size.
   Supporting a causal link between morphology and ecology, performance
   tests indicated that larger-mouthed cottids had significantly higher
   capture success on Heptacarpus shrimp than did smaller-mouthed species.
   As predicted, there were no differences in capture success among
   predators regardless of their attack style or ecomorphological patterns
   in attack on crabs (Cancer and Petrolisthes spp.) when the crabs were
   presented on a sand surface (i.e. `easy prey'). Several difficulties
   still exist when trying to apply a functional group approach to
   ecomorphology. These include the behavioral plasticity of the predators,
   the confounding factor of evolutionary history in identifying correlated
   ecomorphological features, multiple morphological solutions to common
   functional problems, the limitations of traditional dietary studies
   during extremes of prey abundance, and an inadequate understanding of
   the anti- predator defenses of most prey, including modifications that

Abstract = {{Although adolescence is most commonly associated with risk-taking
   behaviour, mortality due to poverty-related conditions is high among
   black African children aged 10 - 14 years, This paper describes a study
   carried out in October 1991 to assess the physical health status of 860
   underprivileged pupils aged 10 - 14 years in Standards 3 - 5 at three
   schools in New Crossroads, near Cape Town, Data on nutritional status,
   age at menarche, blood pressure, eyesight, physical abnormalities,
   injuries and use of hospitals were obtained. The response rate was 90\%,
   Of all the children, 7,2\% were below the 5th percentile weight-for-age.
   The proportion of boys (13,1\%) below the 5th percentile weight-for-age
   was significantly higher than that of girls (3,7\%). Of all the
   children; 19,5\% were below the 5th percentile height-for-age. The
   proportion of boys (24,4\%) below the 5th percentile height-for-age was
   also significantly higher than that of girls (16,7\%). The average age
   at menarche was 13 years, similar to that (12,8 years) reported for the
   UK. In 5\% of the children, the diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mmHg
   and the findings show some increase with age. Red Cross War Memorial
   Children's Hospital accounted for 30,9\% of hospital attendances.
   `Chest' complaints (19,5\%) were frequent reasons for consultations,
   while 15,2\% of the children reported being injured, with car accidents
   (16,0\%), fractures (27,5\%) and burns (20,6\%) being the most common
   injuries. It is suggested that the provision of a 24-hour day hospital
   will ease the load on the referral hospital, i.e. Red Cross War Memorial
   Children's Hospital. Social policy aimed at a safer environment will
   reduce the number of injuries and related physical disability.}},

Abstract = {{Background Numerous psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to play
   a role in coronary heart disease. However, existing studies have yielded
   inconsistent results.
   Methods and Results The relations between type A personality as well as
   suppressed versus expressed anger and risk of nonfatal myocardial
   infarction (MI) were studied in 340 patients and 340 age-, sex-, and
   community-matched control subjects. Subjects were interviewed at home to
   assess behavioral and medical cardiovascular risk factors, and fasting
   blood samples were obtained. Type A personality was associated with
   nonfatal MI in crude matched-pair analysis (OR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.12 to
   2.20; P=.008). Adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors
   (including treated hypertension, body mass index, treated diabetes,
   family history of premature MI, physical activity, smoking, alcohol,
   total calories per day, and saturated fat) did not substantially change
   the magnitude of the point estimate, although the finding was no longer
   statistically significant (OR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 0.97 to 2.09; P=.069).
   Further adjustment for lipids, including total cholesterol, total HDL,
   its subfractions (HDL(2), HDL(3)), LDL, LDL, and triglycerides, markedly
   attenuated the association (OR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.90; P=.687), an
   effect due almost entirely to HDL cholesterol. Suppressed anger was
   positively but not statistically significantly associated with increased
   risk of MI in crude matched-pair analysis (OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 0.98 to
   1.81; P=.065), in analysis adjusted for behavioral and medical
   cardiovascular risk factors (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.78; P=.193),
   or after adjustment for lipids (OR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 1.82;
   P=.695).
   Conclusions These findings suggest a possible association of type A but
   not suppressed anger with risk of nonfatal MI that may be mediated by
   alterations in HDL cholesterol level. If decreases in HDL are not in the
   same causal pathway, then the apparent association between type A
   personality and risk of MI is due to confounding, principally by HDL.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the ubiquity of omnivory in nature, its consequences for
   population dynamics have received little attention from theoretical and
   experimental ecologists. Having three direct consumer-resource links,
   three indirect numerical links, and a potential for indirect effects
   mediated by size structure and/or behavioral flexibility, a
   three-species omnivory system may exhibit complex population dynamics.
   In 2 x 3 m field enclosures in the littoral zone of a lake, I
   manipulated the dominating native benthivorous fish (greater than or
   equal to 2yr-old perch, Perca fluviatilis, omnivorous top consumer) and
   the dominating native benthic invertebrate predators (Sialis lutaria,
   Megaloptera, and odonates, intermediate consumers) in three gradients:
   increasing densities of perch in the near absence of Sialis and
   odonates, and increasing densities of Sialis and odonates in either the
   presence or absence of perch. The densities of their common prey (mainly
   chironomids) were left unmanipulated. Macroinvertebrate abundance,
   biomass, and size structure, as well as gut contents of perch and Sialis
   were sampled monthly over a 3-mo summer period.
   In the absence of perch, the experimental gradient of Sialis densities
   remained unchanged over time. In the presence of perch, Sialis decreased
   by about half at high initial densities, but remained unchanged at low
   initial densities. Perch also had a negative effect on odonates. In the
   near absence of Sialis and odonates, perch had a strong, negative effect
   on chironomids. Compared to enclosures without perch, chironomid
   abundance was strongly reduced at the lowest perch density, but leveled
   off with further increases in perch density. Sialis and odonates did not
   affect chironomid abundance when perch were absent. In contrast,
   chironomid abundance was positively affected by Sialis and odonates when
   perch were present. The overall effect of perch on chironomid abundance
   in the presence of Sialis and odonates was negative.
   The combined predatory and competitive effects of perch on Sialis and
   odonates raise the issue how Sialis and odonates coexist with perch. The
   lack of effect of perch on Sialis and chironomids at low densities of
   these prey suggests that prey refuges contribute significantly to their
   persistence in natural systems. The indirect positive effect of Sialis
   and odonates on chironomids indicates density dependence in per capita
   interaction coefficients and is most likely to be explained by a
   behavioral response of perch or chironomids to Sialis and odonates. I
   suggest that the theoretical and empirical investigation of model
   systems (such as three-component omnivory systems), which are
   sufficiently simple to be analytically and experimentally tractable, but
   still display a richness of common indirect effects, will contribute to
   our understanding of the dynamics of more complex food webs. Their study
   will benefit from experimental manipulations of more than one population
   at more than two densities.}},

Abstract = {{Animal welfare, or well-being, is a social issue with ethical,
   scientific, political, and aesthetic properties. Answering questions
   about the welfare of animals requires scientific definition, assessment,
   solutions, and public acceptance. With respect to the actual well-being
   of the animal, most issues are centered on how the animal `'feels'' when
   managed within a specific level of confinement, during special
   agricultural practices (e.g., tail docking, beak trimming, etc.) and
   handling. Questions of this nature may require exploration of animal
   cognition, motivation, perception, and emotional states in addition to
   more commonly recognized indicators of well-being Several general
   approaches have emerged for solving problems concerning animal
   well-being in intensive production systems: environmental, genetic, and
   therapeutic. Environmental approaches involve modifying existing systems
   to accommodate specific welfare concerns or development of alternative
   systems. Genetic approaches involve changing the behavioral and(or)
   physiological nature of the animal to reduce or eliminate behaviors that
   are undesirable within intensive system. Therapeutic approaches of a
   physical (tail docking, beak trimming) and physiological (drug and
   nutritional therapy) nature bring both concern and promise with regard
   to the reduction of confinement stress. Finally, the recent focus on
   commodity quality assurance programs may indirectly provide benefits for
   animal well-being. Although research in the area of animal well-being
   will provide important information for better animal management,
   handling, care, and the physical design of intensive production systems
   there is still some uncertainty regarding public acceptance. The
   aesthetics of modern intensive production systems may have as much to do
   with public acceptance as with science.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of food to fish larvae influences the mean and variance
   of the growth rate in a cohort. At higher food densities, slower
   developing herring, Clupea harengus, larvae in the pre-metamorphic stage
   may co-occur with more developed, post-metamorphic individuals. The
   development of schooling in herring is closely associated with
   metamorphosis. To assess whether the presence of schooling conspecifics
   encouraged the premature development of schooling in larvae, laboratory
   reared larvae (length 29-31 mm) were exposed to wild-caught schooling
   juveniles (length 55 mm) for the duration of the experiment.
   Observations of larvae from the experimental group were carried out for
   37 days and the behaviour of the fish was recorded on video for
   subsequent analysis. These larvae were observed in the presence and
   absence of schooling juveniles with no food in the observation tank, and
   a few minutes and Ih after food was added. The behaviour of these two
   groups (juveniles present and juveniles absent) was compared with that
   of two additional groups (different rearing densities), where the larvae
   had not been exposed to schooling herring. The exposure to schooling
   conspecifics did not affect the degree of interaction among herring
   larvae unless the juveniles were present in the observation tank.
   Consequently, in the presence of a school the larvae seemed to opt for
   the increased protection of the school, regardless of associated
   disadvantages, such as greater competition for food. These findings are
   discussed in relation to larval vulnerability to predators. (C) 1995 The

Abstract = {{The present review focuses on the relation to human behavior and
   development of anthropometric or dietary indexes of mild-to-moderate
   malnutrition. The primary goal of the review is to integrate previous
   research findings with current findings from correlational studies
   conducted over the past decade. From this integration, the following
   conclusions may be drawn: 1) Chronic, mild postnatal malnutrition is
   associated with a variety of cognitive and behavioral deficits across
   the life span. The role of prenatal malnutrition in this process is less
   clear. 2) To understand the role chronic mild malnutrition plays in
   behavior and development, it is necessary to move beyond protein-calorie
   deficits to consider the role of intake of animal source foods and
   specific micronutrients such as iron, zinc and B vitamins. 3) Chronic
   mild malnutrition is embedded in a host of other biological and
   psychosocial risk factors. As a result, chronic mild malnutrition
   appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for producing
   behavioral deficits. 4) The salience of chronic mild malnutrition as a
   risk factor is accentuated when other psychosocial-contextual risk
   factors are also present or when multiple low-level nutrient deficits
   are interacting. Suggestions for future research directions include an
   emphasis on interactions between nutrients and between specific
   psychosocial and nutritional risk factors; the ways in which individual
   (e.g., gender) or cultural characteristics can moderate nutrition
   development relations; and a broader range of populations, such as

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have shown that:
   1) A chronic 10 month daily administration to rats of the benzodiazepine
   (BDZ) receptor antagonist, flumazenil (FL; 4 mg/kg in drinking water),
   from the age of 13 through 22 months, significantly retarded the
   age-related loss of cognitive functions, as ascertained by the radial
   arm maze tests conducted two months after FL withdrawal.
   2) An equal number of 8 rats died in the control and FL-treated group
   before the behavioral tests were completed and the animals were
   sacrificed; the life span of the FL-treated 8 rats equaled 24.0 (+/-0.6
   SEM) months, while that of the control 8 rats equaled 22.3 months
   (+/-0.7 SEM), and the group difference was marginally significant
   (p=0.04 Mann-Whitney test).
   3) In rats sacrificed 3 months after FL withdrawal and behavioral
   testing, the protective action of FL, relative to age-matched controls,
   was revealed by a significant reduction in the age-related loss of
   neurons in the hippocampal formation.
   4) In the time period of 3 months between the drug withdrawal and
   sacrificing of the animals, stress experienced by the aging rats during
   behavioral testing, related to excessive daily handling of the animals
   and partial food deprivation to motivate them to perform in the radial
   arm maze, apparently had excitotoxic effects on the hippocampal neurons,
   as indexed by the presence of 30\% neurons in a state of moderate
   pyknosis found both in the FL group and the age-matched controls. In the
   6 months `'young'' control group, the number of pyknotic neurons equaled
   only 3.5\%. It was concluded that the drug withdrawal and stress of
   behavioral testing unleashed the previously FL-controlled age-related
   degeneration. On the basis of these results and the literature, showing
   that the tone of the GABAergic system increases with age, and
   particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the hypothesis of brain aging
   was formulated. It postulates that in mammals, with growing age, and
   prematurely in humans with AD, the increasing tone of the BDZ/GABAergic
   system interferes with antero- and retrograde axonal transport through a
   chronic depolarizing block of preterminal axon varicosities of the
   ascending aminergic and cholinergic/peptidergic systems, which are
   indispensable for normal metabolic/trophic glial-neuronal relationships.
   Such a state leads to discrete anatomic deafferentation of forebrain
   systems, and particularly of the neocortex, where block of the
   anterograde axonal transport results in induction of the cortical mRNA
   responsible for synthesis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta
   APP). The simultaneous block of retrograde transport from chronically
   depolarized preterminal axon varicosities may account for toxic
   accumulation in cortex of the nerve growth factor (NGF) and other
   trophins, without which the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
   degenerate.
   The general pharmacologic profile of FL has been discussed on the basis
   of FL administration to animals and healthy and diseased humans. This
   profile shows that FL:
   1) increases brain metabolic functions;
   2) reduces emotional responses, thereby stabilizing the functions of the
   autonomic system in both humans and animals challenged by adverse
   environmental stimuli;
   3) improves cognitive and coordinated motor functions in both humans and
   animals;
   4) uniquely combines anxiolytic, vigilance and cognitive enhancing, i.e.
   nootropic, properties, which may, in part, stem from FL-induced
   emotional imperturbability (ataraxy);
   5) facilitates habituation of healthy humans and animals to novel but
   inconsequential environmental stimuli, and promotes non-aggressive
   interactions among animals;
   6) in single i.v. doses, and administered chronically to humans, FL has
   antiepileptic actions in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other forms of
   epilepsy characterized by `'spike-and-dome'' EEG patterns; these actions
   are likely to depend on FL's disinhibition of the serotonin system;
   7) administered in single i.v. doses to healthy humans, or chronically
   to 3-4 month-old rats in drinking water, FL causes restless,
   curiosity-driven and non-aggressive exploratory behavior, an effect
   which is probably related to increased brain metabolic functions, which
   in rats is indexed by increased time the animals spend in REM sleep
   without disturbing slow wave sleep EEG patterns.}},

Abstract = {{An individual-based population dynamics model (IBM) was used to examine
   the effect of different behavioral, bioenergetic, and physiological
   assumptions on individual growth and development of the copepod,
   Metridia lucens, in the North Atlantic Ocean. Both intrinsic
   (nutritional condition, feeding history, size) and extrinsic
   (temperature, food resources) factors that might determine individual
   growth and development rates were examined. An advantage of an IBM is
   that it allows for inter-individual variability, and can thereby provide
   an indication of the range of responses that might arise from natural
   variation in environmental conditions. The model is a refinement of an
   earlier model that successfully reproduced the observed stage structure
   and abundance of Metridia pacifica in the sub-arctic Pacific (Batchelder
   and Miller, 1989). Consequently, parameters for the ingestion and
   metabolic functions were set initially to those found appropriate for M.
   pacifica from previous model studies. Extrinsic forcing variables used
   to drive the population model were depth-specific temperature and
   chlorophyll a concentration. The model was run in two modes:
   chronological and individual. In the former mode, the model used
   measured temperature and chlorophyll a data to reproduce the
   life-history timing (phenology) and seasonal stage-structure of a M.
   lucens population measured in the early 1970s from Ocean Weather Station
   India in the North Atlantic. The individual mode was used to examine
   variation in growth caused by inter-individual variability in
   short-medium term starvation and feeding success. Ingestion, growth, and
   development were sensitive to variations in food resources. Factors that
   increased consumption rates, such as more effective searching for high
   chlorophyll layers, or recent starvation resulting in a `'hunger
   response'' in the functional response relation, led to markedly faster
   growth and development rates. Model simulations indicate that
   inter-individual variability in growth dynamics decreased for copepods
   capable of plasticity in the physiological hunger response or more
   effective food-searching behavior. Such searching behavior accentuated
   already existing inter-annual and intra-annual differences in individual
   growth dynamics forced by temperature and food. Conversely, hunger
   acclimation reduced intraannual (seasonal) variability and reduced,
   although only slightly, inter-annual variability in growth dynamics.
   These model results highlight the importance of understanding how
   copepods respond to environmental conditions. Two methods behavioral
   modification and physiological acclimation-by which copepods might
   ameliorate low food conditions, lead to different responses to temporal
   and spatial variability of resources. (C) 1995 International Council for

Abstract = {{To investigate the function of the amygdala following traumatic brain
   injury (TBI), rats were tested on a gustatory neophobia task that is
   sensitive to amygdala and hippocampaI damage. Rats were either injured
   at a moderate level of fluid percussion injury (2.1 atm) or surgically
   prepared but not injured (sham-injury). Seven days after injury (n = 8)
   or sham injury (n = 9), rats were habituated to the testing chamber
   without food items present for 30 min. All rats were then food deprived.
   Twenty-four hours later, rats were placed in the testing chamber for 30
   min and allowed to eat freely from four dishes of different foods: rat
   chow, raisins, potatoes, and cookies. Results showed that injured and
   sham-injured rats did not differ in their ability to find hidden food,
   suggesting that TBI does not produce an enduring impairment of
   olfaction. There was also no difference in the total amount of food
   eaten between injured and sham groups (p > 0.05). The percentage of each
   type of food consumed did differ between the two groups with sham
   controls consuming more familiar food (rat chow) compared to the
   unfamiliar foods (p < 0.01). The injured animals distributed their
   eating evenly among the four foods with no particular preference for any
   one food (p > 0.05). This pattern of eating behavior in injured animals
   is similar to animals that have lesions to both the hippocampus and
   amygdala (Sutherland and McDonald, 1990). Therefore, the results of this
   experiment suggest that, in addition to the hippocampus, the amygdala
   may also contribute to the behavioral changes observed following TBI.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in resource abundance affects population dynamics by altering
   demographic processes and interactions among individuals in the
   population. For small mammals, food is likely to be a critical resource.
   Population densities should vary directly with food abundance, but the
   underlying demographic changes are more difficult to predict. We
   experimentally increased food available to populations of hispid cotton
   rats, Sigmodon hispidus, to examine how rates of recruitment and
   disappearance varied with food abundance. We expected supplemental food
   to increase winter survival and to increase recruitment, perhaps
   advancing the date of first reproduction in the spring. We also thought
   larger behaviorally dominant animals might dominate the point sources of
   supplemental food, altering age or size ratios and producing an excess
   of transient animals.
   Supplemental food increased population densities but did not dampen
   pronounced seasonal fluctuations. Supplemented populations contained
   proportionately more juveniles and small adults than did controls;
   social behavior may have limited increases in numbers of large adults.
   Survival rates did not change; density increases were due to increased
   reproduction and immigration. In supplemented populations, reproductive
   effort by females increased, but the proportion of reproductive females
   decreased. Reproductive females and nonreproductive animals of both
   sexes were less likely to be transients than were reproductive males.
   Transients constituted higher proportions of control populations because
   of successful settlement, primarily by juveniles and small adults, into
   supplemented areas. The strongly seasonal climatic conditions under
   which northern S. hispidus populations exist produce contrasting
   selective pressures which might favor season-specific foraging
   strategies. Our data support a scenario of territorial females and
   wandering males in the reproductive season, with females maximizing
   resource acquisition for production of offspring. During winter, both
   sexes may restrict foraging time (and exposure to predators and weather)
   to the minimum required for survival.}},

Abstract = {{The tropical and subtropical estuarine fish Rivulus marmoratus is known
   for its synchronous, self-fertilizing hermaphroditism. It matures within
   3 mo and can produce eggs throughout the year These features would allow
   a particular strain to quickly colonize refuge such as crab holes in the
   high intertidal zone habitat. However, a high strain diversity has been
   found in the field. In order to explain this observation, we examined
   the phenotypic responses of R. marmoratus to variation in biotic and
   abiotic environmental factors over two consecutive generations and
   employed a modified Euler-Lotka equation to estimate and compare the net
   reproductive rate, R, among strains. We included five strains of R.
   marmoratus and manipulated levels of temperature, salinity, and food for
   the parental generation and levels of food only for the second
   generation. Low temperature (19 degrees C) inhibited sexual maturity,
   precluding any egg production during the entire 6-mo study. For
   individuals kept at high temperature (26 degrees C), salinity and food
   had an interactive effect on time to maturity, body size at maturity,
   and number of eggs produced. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we
   found a significant two-way interactive effect (food levels for the
   parental and the second generations) on the five reproductive traits
   studied in the second generation. When each trait was analyzed
   separately, we found significant three-way interactions for time to
   maturity and total length at maturity.
   We found that the fitness values for each strain varied in different
   environmental combinations (3 salinities x 3 incubation salinities for
   eggs x 2 food levels). However, four of five strains had similar overall
   fitness. Despite a lack of generic variation within each strain, X.
   marmoratus demonstrates considerable phenotypic variation in response to
   environmental changes. This feature and genetic variation among strains
   may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an
   extremely variable and stressful environment.}},

   Surprisingly, densities of mature whelks up to 12 times the average were

   exposure of adult B.plicatilis to P.piscicida as a food resource, alone
   or in combination with the non-toxic green algae Nannochloris and
   Tetraselmis, did not increase rotifer mortality relative to animals that

Abstract = {{1.  Prey-size selectivity of predators can play an important role in
   determining the predators' impact on their prey.  In marine systems, a
   pattern of preference for small-sized molluscan prey is widespread among
   crustacean predators, even though predators are often able to consume
   prey over a wider size range.
   2.  In laboratory tests the blue crab Callinectes sapidus showed
   preference for smaller individuals of the hard clam Mercenaria
   mercenaria.  This was true for crabs starved for different durations of
   time, prior to experiment.  Hungrier crabs tended to be less selective
   than the less hungry ones, although not significantly so.
   3.  In order to determine whether such selectivity is hard-wired (i.e.
   engrained) or can be modified through experience, adult blue crabs were
   tested for preference between two different sizes of hard clams after a
   phase of conditioning on different combinations of live and sham (i.e.
   empty valves glued together and deployed in living position) clams of
   the two sizes.
   4.  In the conditioning trial, crabs consumed more sham clams of both
   sizes than live clams, although sham clams did not yield any energy
   return.  The greater consumption of sham clams by blue crabs might be
   explained by the lower cost of crushing dead clam shells, as dead shells
   seemed to be more brittle than the live ones.
   5.  Conditioning significantly affected size selectivity in the
   subsequent test trial.  Crabs assigned to different conditioning
   treatments consumed significantly different proportions of large clams
   in the test trial.  In particular, crabs that had consumed greater
   proportions of large (sham) clams during the conditioning trial also ate
   significantly greater proportions of large (live) clams in the test
   trial than those which had consumed greater proportions of small (sham)
   clams during conditioning.
   6.  These results indicate that the blue crabs' preference for
   small-sized clams does not result from a fixed decision rule and suggest
   that crabs might modify their preferences through experience. 
   Furthermore, the relative strength of shells seemed more important than
   profitability ratios in determining patterns of prey-size consumption.
   7.  An understanding of what perceptual and cognitive constraints
   underlie feeding preferences of `keystone' marine predators could help
   in making predictions about the impact of such predators on prey
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Follow-up of early-treated children with PKU has shown that diet
   discontinuation in childhood presents risks of cognitive and emotional
   dysfunction in a substantial number of adolescents and young adults.
   This dysfunction includes IQ loss, mental processing abnormalities,
   learning difficulties, anxiety and personality disorders. In addition,
   neurologic deterioration has been reported in several such individuals.
   As a consequence of this current understanding of PKU, diet
   continuation, at least through adolescence and in the young adult years,
   is now recommended. Many centers are extending this to a policy of
   `'diet for life''. This represents a major challenge to adolescents and
   their families. Metabolic control using the criteria applied during
   childhood is virtually impossible to achieve past 12 years of age. Time
   constraints, social pressures, financial limitations and growing
   independence from the family combine to interfere with dietary control.
   Added to these difficulties are the biological changes during teenage
   years which reduce phenylalanine tolerance. To meet these challenges, we
   have identified a number of psychosocial factors that interfere with
   adherence to medical recommendations. The factors most highly related to
   metabolic control were social support for the diet and positive
   perceptions of treatment. This information has led to the development of
   support programs for adolescents and young adults with PKU. These
   programs include an annual New England maternal PKU camp, a resource
   mothers program in which mothers of young children with PKU are matched
   to women with PKU who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant
   and assist with meal planning, cooking, metabolic monitoring, and
   transportation to medical appointments as well as provide enormous
   emotional support to these young women, and a PKU CORPS which brings
   together on-diet adolescents for training and emotional support and then
   matches them with younger phenylketonuric children on diet. The benefits
   of these programs are becoming clear in terms of improved metabolic
   control, successful re-institution of diet, a more comfortable
   acceptance of PKU and a better self-image.}},

   Bell 412 helicopters were simulated flying across the molting grounds

   airfields.  The model determined the behavioral and energetic responses
   of every bird encountered by the aircraft during an overflight, then
   calculated the weight of these birds at the end of wing molt.  Body
   condition of the brant, reflected in weight loss, was used to quantify
   the impact of helicopter disturbance.  The number of birds in each of
   five risk categories was determined for each route, altitude, helicopter
   type, and overflight frequency.  Flight lines and overflight patterns
   that minimized disturbance to the molting population were identified. 
   Slightly altering the direct route between the two airfields resulted in
   up to 91\% fewer birds experiencing heavy weight loss.  Flying either
   helicopter type around the southern edge of the molting grounds caused
   the least disturbance; flying parallel to the coast, 1.6 km inland,
   caused the most.  The Bell 412 caused up to 15\% more weight loss than

   flying only when most brant are in their second week of molt, 3)

Title = {{FORAGING STRATEGIES OF DOGWHELKS, NUCELLA-LAPILLUS (L) - INTERACTING
   EFFECTS OF AGE, DIET AND CHEMICAL CUES TO THE THREAT OF PREDATION}},

Abstract = {{The effects of diet history, hunger and predation risk on short-term
   behavioral decisions of dogwhelks were tested in a specially designed
   test apparatus, termed a linear feeding array (LFA). The LFA consists of
   a sequential series of prey items mounted in a flume with unidirectional
   current directed towards a test (predatory) animal, and into which
   potential olfactory cues regarding predation risk are introduced. For
   dogwhelks the array was constructed vertically to accomodate intertidal
   foraging movements and is termed a vertical linear array (VLA). The
   behaviors exhibited by the dogwhelks were interpreted from distribution
   patterns in the VLA. Recent experimental studies and advances in optimal
   foraging theory provided the basis for the hypotheses tested in the VLA,
   which included: foraging and other behaviors are affected by predation,
   animals will avoid risk in the presence of predation threat, responses
   to predation threat will be proportional to the number and kinds of
   predator cues present, and starved animals will take greater risks than
   fed animals. We also test the proposition that foraging decisions are
   further modified by age. Three groups of juvenile and adult animals were
   maintained on diets of barnacles, mussels or no food (starved). The
   scent of crabs and damaged conspecifics served as olfactory cues to
   predation risk. Dogwhelks exhibited a range of behaviors in the VLA
   including: sheltering, searching, feeding, and aerial climbing.
   Distribution of animals in the tank assumed a relatively stable pattern
   after 2-3 h. These patterns were interpreted as the consequence of
   heirarchial decision making including: (i) a decision to become active,
   leaving the resting place or water refuge adopted during initial
   placement, followed by (ii) a decision to move vertically upwards or
   downwards, and (iii) a decision to attack prey when encountered.
   Analysis of movement patterns revealed that the initial decision,
   analogous to leaving a crevice as the tide comes in, was influenced in
   adults by predator cues and in juveniles by both predator cues and diet
   history. Perceived risk, as crab and damaged-conspecific odors, made
   individuals more likely to remain inactive, a risk-avoiding strategy for
   animals already in a refuge. Starved animals were more likely to descend
   into the tank and attack prey than fed animals. Our results support the
   hypotheses that higher-order predators affect the foraging decisions of
   dogwhelks and that juveniles and satiated animals are more sensitive to
   predation risk than starved ones. Together, these and earlier studies
   suggest that dogwhelks assess their environment before foraging, and
   that they are attuned to reducing the risks of mortality.}},

   received a 16\% protein diet. From 21 to 100 days of age, all rats
   received a balanced lab chow diet. At 21, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,
   and 100 days of age, independent groups of malnourished and control
   animals were exposed to the elevated plus-maze and allowed to explore

   or increased exploration in the maze with age, in contrast to well
   nourished animals, which exhibited a steady decrease in exploration as
   they matured. The higher number of entries and time spent in the open
   arms suggest that the protein malnutrition causes a permanent increase

   this naturalistic animal model of anxiety.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An important assumption made in most life-history theory is that there
   is a trade-off between age and size at reproduction. This trade-off may,
   however, disappear if growth rate varies adaptively. The fact that
   individuals do not always grow at the maximum rate can only be
   understood if high growth rates carry a cost. This study investigates
   the presence and nature of such costs in Pararge aegeria. Five females
   from two populations with known differences in life history (south
   Sweden and Madeira) were allowed to oviposit in the laboratory and their
   offspring were reared in environmental chambers under conditions leading
   to direct development. We measured several aspects of life history,
   including development times, pupal and adult weights, growth rate,
   female fecundity, longevity and larval starvation endurance. In both
   populations there seemed to be genetic variation in growth rate. There
   was no evidence for a trade-off between age and size at pupation. As
   predicted, larvae with high growth rates also lost weight at a
   relatively higher rate during starvation. High weight-loss rates were
   furthermore associated with a lower probability of surviving when food
   became available again. This is apparently the first physiological
   trade-off with growth rate that has been experimentally demonstrated. In
   both populations there were significant differences in growth rate
   between the sexes, but the populations differed in which sex was growing
   at the highest rate. In Sweden males had higher growth rates than
   females, whereas the reverse was true for Madeira. These patterns most
   likely reflect differences in selection for protandry, in turn caused by
   differences in seasonality between Sweden and Madeira. Together with the
   finding that males had shorter average longevity than females in the
   Swedish, but not in the Madeiran, population, this indicates that a
   lower adult quality also may be a cost of high growth rate. We argue
   that for the understanding of life history variation it is necessary to
   consider not only the two dimensions of age and size, but also to take
   into full account the triangular nature of the relationship between
   size, time and growth rate.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to being a pharmacological agent, alcohol (ethanol) can also
   be considered a food; the body can utilize effectively its calorific
   contribution. The consumption of alcohol has in many respects the same
   characteristics as the intake of food. In animal experiments, food
   intake decreases in relation to the calorific value of the alcohol
   consumed; in human studies, various results have been obtained from no
   compensation to full compensation for the contribution from alcohol. If
   a choice is possible, primarily the carbohydrate part of the diet is
   decreased for compensation to ethanol intake. Food, in turn, can
   influence alcohol consumption. There is evidence that it is the
   carbohydrate content of the diet which influences alcohol drinking. The
   daily intake of alcohol is equally or even better regulated than intake
   of carbohydrate, protein, or fat. There is a circadian rhythm of alcohol
   consumption which resembles the rhythm of food intake. However, the
   mechanism which regulates alcohol intake does not have a very strong
   influence on the behaviour of most animals or humans, and its control is
   often overpowered by outside factors. Nevertheless, it is important to
   identify the precise mechanism because a better understanding should
   provide valuable information for use in the search for risk markers and

Abstract = {{Mathematical models are used to determine the optimal foraging effort of

   than that of overestimating risk, imperfect information should lead to
   behavior that is appropriate for a lesser risk than is actually present.
   Overestimation is favored under the opposite condition. If there is a
   trade-off between starvation and predation, an animal will usually
   underestimate (overestimate) risk if the third derivative of the
   starvation-versus-risk relation is positive (negative), provided
   uncertainty is not too large. Different, plausible starvation functions
   can favor either under- or overestimates of risk. If there is a
   trade-off between reproduction and predation, a more complex condition
   determines which type of bias is adaptive; this condition involves the
   reproduction-versus-risk function and its first three derivatives, and
   again, over- or underestimation of risk can be advantageous. In almost

   repeated trips between the nest and the food source. On the contrary, in

   hypothesis, chicks were trained on a passive avoidance learning task and
   given bilateral intracerebral injections of selective mineralocorticoid
   (RU-28318) or glucocorticoid (RU-38486) receptor antagonists. The

Abstract = {{Physical contact between the freshwater ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus

   behavioural response of the potential prey which is different from the
   normal `'avoiding reaction'' of Euplotes. Because of its defensive
   character it is called `'escape response''. The response was analysed by
   the use of a video camera and recorder system. It was found that the
   escape response takes a regular course, beginning with sudden backward
   moving of Euplotes, followed by a rapid turn around and a subsequent
   forward movement. Velocities during the escape response are 1 to 5 times
   higher than calculated for control cells. The whole reaction lasts about
   2 s. Within this time a Euplotes cell moves more than 1,000 mum away
   from its predator. While 90 \% of well-fed Euplotes cells demonstrated
   the defensive response, starved cells cultivated separately from their
   predators revealed fewer escape responses, however, several of the
   starved cells regained the capacity for the escape response after
   exposure to Stenostomum or Stenostomum-conditioned medium for 20 h. It
   is discussed whether or not the inducible behavioural response is

Abstract = {{The incubation routine and mass changes of male and female Blue Petrel
   Halobaena caerulea were studied at the Kerguelen Islands to investigate
   factors influencing the durations of incubation stints and foraging
   trips at sea and the factors determining nest desertion and return to
   the nest.
   The body mass at the start of an incubation shift and also when the bird
   was relieved varied throughout the incubation period, whereas the mass
   when birds deserted the nest was stable. Birds deserted the nest when
   their mass decreased to threshold, independent of the duration of the
   fast. Temporary egg neglect was observed in successful as well as in
   unsuccessful breeding attempts, but it increased the risk of breeding
   failure. The net and daily mass gained at sea during the second part of
   the incubation period were higher than during the first part, suggesting
   an increase in food availability. During the first part, the mass gained
   at sea and time spent foraging were inversely related to the mass of the
   bird before it left the burrow, whereas a similar relationship did not
   occur thereafter.
   The results suggest the occurrence of a fixed mass threshold when birds
   decide to leave the nest if not relieved by their partner. The mass when
   a bird left its nest influenced the time spent foraging or mass gained
   when food was scarce. Although decision rules to leave the nest or
   return from the sea are related to body condition, the possibility of
   neglecting the eggs temporarily enables Blue Petrels to regulate the
   trade-off between risks of breeding failure and risks of an increase in
   adult mortality. A model for behavioural decision to stop incubating or
   stop feeding, based on a variable set point, is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of animals face the continual problem of balancing the
   trade-off between reducing predation risks and maintaining or increasing

   asymmetric: each separate behavioral decision may lead to only a
   marginal increase in fitness, but may place the organism's entire future
   reproduction in jeopardy. Consequently, the organism's reproductive
   value is an important component of most antipredator decision problems.
   In this paper reproductive value is considered as an asset in need of
   protection. The `'asset-protection principle'' states that the larger
   the current reproductive asset, the more important it becomes to protect
   it. Because reproductive value is usually age and condition dependent,
   optimal antipredator behavior also often depends on these variables. I
   use a uniform modeling technique (dynamic programming) to address a

   lessonae and R. esculenta, to simulated predation by fish and hunger.
   Tadpoles, hatched and reared in the laboratory, were tested in a
   three-way factorial (predation risk x hunger x species) experiment with
   four predation levels and four hunger levels. Both species decreased
   their swimming activity with increasing predation risk. Predation risk
   did not influence the amount of activity time invested in feeding but
   caused the tadpoles to spend less time in patches with food. Refuges
   were not used to avoid predation. R. esculenta was more sensitive to
   predation risk than R. lessonae. Hunger increased both the activity of
   tadpoles and the amount of activity time invested in feeding, thus
   indicating an increased energy intake. No interactions were observed
   between predation risk and hunger. These results show that tadpoles
   possess genetically-based behavioural mechanisms that allow them to
   respond in a graded manner to predation and hunger. However, they did
   not balance the two conflicting demands of predation avoidance and
   effective foraging; the two mechanisms appeared to act independently.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the dynamic behavior of a model of an unstable
   food chain consisting of three species or trophic levels. The model
   assumes that each of the consumer species has a Holling type 2
   functional response. The study examines how dynamic behaviors and
   top-level population densities change with the carrying capacity of the
   bottom level. In all cases examined, the mean population density of the
   top species initially increases, but eventually decreases as carrying
   capacity is increased. In some cases, a sufficient increase in the
   carrying capacity of the bottom species leads to extinction of the top
   species. If the maximum rate of change of the top species is
   sufficiently slow relative to the middle species, the period of the
   population cycles in the top species can change rapidly with a small
   change in the carrying capacity of the bottom species. Low carrying
   capacities produce simple cycles with a long period, while high carrying
   capacities produce simple cycles with a short period. For intermediate
   carrying capacities, more complex dynamical behaviors, including chaos,
   may occur. Systems that have only one equilibrium point with all species
   present may have two alternative attractors with very different
   densities of the top-level species. The responses of the bottom two
   species to an increased carrying capacity are also discussed. The
   results imply that nutrient enrichment may adversely affect high-level
   consumers and that reductions in the density of top-level consumers may
   make it difficult or impossible to restore their populations.}},

Abstract = {{Several predatory organisms induce a defensive morphological response in
   the freshwater ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus. The morphological changes
   have demographic cost besides an adaptive advantage. The generation time
   of E. octocarinatus increased from 40 +/- 1 h (SDM) to 47 +/- 2 h when
   the ciliate changes its morphology in response to the presence of
   Stenostomum sphagnetorum (Turbellaria). It remained at a high level in
   the protective `'winged'' form of the ciliates (45 +/- 1 h). The
   population growth rate therefore decreased by 15 \% (from r = 0.60/d to
   r = 0.51/d). When predators had disappeared the duration of the
   following reproduction cycle decreased to 38 +/- 1 h. A longer growth
   phase of winged ciliates was related to their lowered reproduction rate.
   The length of the G1-phase of the cell cycle increased from 25 +/- 1 h
   to 34 +/- 2 h (SD); the length of the S phase remained constant (13 +/-
   1 h or 12 +/- 3 h). Synthesis of proteins was necessary for
   predator-induced morphological changes. The protein content of Euplotes
   octocarinatus increased from 1.1 +/- 0.1 pg/ciliate to 1.7 +/- 0.2 pg
   (SD) during morphological transformation. The protein synthesis
   inhibitor cycloheximid (greater-than-or-equal-to 50 muM) inhibited
   morphological changes. These results indicate that additional growth of
   the ciliate is necessary for morphological changes. The growth process
   leads as a cost to an increased generation time of Euplotes. The feeding
   rate of winged forms of the ciliate had slightly increased compared to
   the feeding rate of the typical form. Therefore, food limitation is not
   crucial for the cost of predator-induced defence; however, it may be
   beneficial for the winged form.}},

Abstract = {{A state-dependent model has been used to predict daily and tidal
   patterns of migration, feeding and inactivity in juvenile plaice
   (Pleuronectes platessa L.) in their intertidal and shallow subtidal
   nursery areas. Vertical position, quantity of energy reserves and
   fullness of the gut characterized the state of individual fishes. If
   feeding is visually mediated, the model predicts that, by night, plaice
   should move to areas of low predation risk and become inactive, whereas
   by day, plaice should migrate to feed in areas of high prey encounter
   rate. Vertical zones adopted by day and night and, hence, patterns of
   migration, should depend on the distributions of predators and prey.
   When prey are more abundant in the intertidal zone, plaice should move
   onshore to feed as the tide rises and when prey are more abundant
   offshore, plaice should move offshore to feed by day. If predators are
   equally abundant in all zones, the fish should behave as if no predators
   were present, having no effective refuge. An increase in the abundance
   of predators with depth results in the restriction of plaice activities
   to shallower vertical zones, depending on the magnitude of the predation
   threat. Zones adopted thus depend on the trade-off between energy intake
   and predation risk. Concordance between predicted behaviour and observed
   patterns is evident in contrasting habitats. Migration and feeding in
   the Wadden Sea, where prey are more abundant on intertidal flats, is
   dominated by the tidal component, whereas on impoverished exposed
   beaches of the west coast of Scotland, the diurnal component is
   dominant. Tidally related behaviour persists in the latter environment,
   not predicted by the model and may be a consequence of using endogenous
   rhythms to approach optimal behavioural patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Although the behavioral consequences of domestication in fish have long
   been the subject of considerable interest among aquaculture geneticists,
   there is not yet a clear understanding of the conditions under which
   aggression increases or decreases during domestication. In addition,
   very little is known about how behaviors correlated with aggression may
   be altered by domestication. In this paper the evidence for an increase
   as well as a decrease in aggression during domestication in fish is
   first critically evaluated. Then the various mechanisms by which
   competitive behavior in fish can affect individual growth rates under
   natural or artificial conditions are described. It is concluded that the
   direction and intensity of any phenotypic change in food-related
   agonistic behavior following natural or artificial selection for rapid
   growth will depend on the relationship between agonistic behavior and
   access to food. Indirect selection on agonistic behavior as a result of
   direct selection on growth will be significant if selection is conducted
   under competitive conditions that promote aggressive interactions, and
   will be positive or negative depending on whether food is limited or
   available in excess. Changes in aggression induced by domestication are
   likely to induce changes in behaviors that are affected by aggression
   including schooling behavior. The tendency to school results from a
   balance between attracting factors and repelling factors. This balance
   between competitive (repelling) and antipredator (attracting) tendencies
   can be altered by domestication and such behavioral alterations may
   affect survival of wild populations if domestic stocks are allowed to
   interbreed with wild stocks.}},

   Although breeding was continuous, the populations were frequently
   dominated by distinct cohorts and there was a sexual phase in spring. 
   Growth rates, particularly in Quarry Pond, were often slow, and clutch
   sizes generally small.  Egg and neonate sizes changed seasonally, but
   changes were not closely related to clutch sizes and body lengths.  In
   Taieri Pond and Raupo Pond some D. carinata grew to 6.14 mm and carried
   clutches of up to 154 eggs.  The potentially high fecundity associated
   with large size makes D. carinata a good coloniser, but our studies
   showed that it also survives well in poor food conditions by growing
   slowly and producing only 1-2 eggs per clutch.
   D. carinata showed marked seasonal polymorphism in tailspine length and
   development of head crests.  In winter, crests were absent and
   tailspines were short and varied little with body length.  Crests were
   first apparent, and tailspines began to elongate, in early spring,

   they had started. Such `'favourite'' stones were often, but not always,
   attached with silk to the bottom by the larvae. The locomotory activity
   of larvae from two populations peaked during springtime prior to
   pupation in the field. High locomotory activity was linked to an
   elevated risk of predation by bullheads. The activity of starved larvae
   in a poor energetic condition was high relative to that of unstarved
   larvae. Over the year, larvae from the two populations differed markedly
   with respect to energy content and activity, and those in a poor
   condition were most active. The latter originated from a habitat devoid
   of fish predators. When larvae of the same energetic status from both
   populations were compared, those from the fishless stream still
   exhibited a higher activity. This result indicated that a high

   speculate that different levels of activity in larvae from the two

Abstract = {{When animals can choose from a range of feeding options, often those
   options with a higher energetic gain carry a higher risk of predation.
   This paper analyses the optimal trade-off between food and predation. We
   are primarily interested in how an animal's decisions and its state
   change over time. Our models are very general. They can be applied to
   growth decisions, such as choice of habitat, in which case we might
   consider how the state variable size changes over an animal's lifetime.
   Equally our models are applicable to short-term foraging decisions, such
   as vigilance level, in which case we might consider how energy reserves
   vary over a day. We concentrate on two cases: (i) the animal must reach
   a fixed state, its fitness depending on when this is attained; (ii) the
   animal must survive to a fixed time, its fitness depending on its final
   state.
   In case (i) minimization of mortality per unit increase of state is
   optimal under certain baseline conditions. In case (ii) behaviour is
   constant over time under baseline conditions (the `Risk-spreading
   Theorem'). We analyse how these patterns are modified by complicating
   factors, e.g. time penalties, premature termination of the food supply,
   stochasticity in food supply or in metabolic expenditure, and
   state-dependence in the ability to obtain food, in metabolic expenditure
   and in predation risk. From this analysis we obtain a variety of
   possible explanations for why an animal should reduce its intake rate
   over time (i.e. show satiation). We show how -earlier work can be viewed
   as special cases of our results.}},

Abstract = {{Predators can have consequences on prey populations and communities that
   extend well beyond direct predator-induced mortality. Predator-prey
   interactions often affect prey feeding rates, growth rates, or
   fecundities, thereby significantly affecting reproductive success of
   prey adults. Thus, investigation of the sublethal fitness consequences
   of behavioral responses of prey to predators is essential to our
   understanding of the total impact of predators on prey populations and
   communities. Feeding (algal grazing) rates, growth rates, and
   fecundities of Baetis bicaudatus (Baetidae) larvae were measured in
   replicated circular flow-through stream channels to determine the
   sublethal consequences on fitness correlates of the presence of
   predatory stoneflies (Perlodidae). Gut fullness of 24-h starved Baetis
   larvae was measured using fluorometry after 24 h (short-term
   experiments) in four treatments: (1) ambient resource rocks and no
   predators, (2) low resource rocks and no predators, (3) ambient resource
   rocks and one female perlodid stonefly (Megarcys signata), or (4)
   Kogotus modestus whose mouthparts were glued to prevent lethal effects
   of predation. Mid-instar male and female Baetis larvae were reared for 3
   wk until wing pad maturation (long-term experiments) and subjected to
   all but the Kogotus treatment. Predator avoidance significantly reduced
   levels of Baetis gut fullness, over the short term, to levels
   intermediate between the high and low resource treatments. Longer term
   residence with predatory stoneflies caused larvae of both male and
   female Baetis to mature at significantly smaller sizes than in the
   treatment with ambient food but no predators. Mayflies with predators
   matured at sizes similar to those held with low food levels over the
   long term. Interestingly, both starved larvae and those avoiding
   predators did not grow during the experimental period in contrast to
   about a 50\% growth rate of larvae experiencing ambient food levels, but
   no predators. Similarly, egg biomass per mature female larva was
   significantly reduced in both starved and predator treatments. The
   proportion of total body mass allocated to eggs was only reduced in
   starved mayflies indicating that the females avoiding predators accrued
   less total mass, but allocated a similar proportion to eggs as did
   well-fed Baetis. These data convincingly demonstrate that predator
   avoidance can have dramatic consequences on mayfly fitness. The
   mechanism explaining those fitness consequences is probably a disruptive
   drift/swim response by Baetis to encounters with stoneflies, which
   reduces Baetis' feeding rates. If we accept the assumption that natural
   selection has shaped the foraging behavior of organisms to maximize
   fitness, foragers need to make decisions that maximize both survivorship
   (minimizing risk of predation) and fecundity. In mayflies fecundity is
   entirely a function of resource acquisition by the larvae, which makes
   them particularly vulnerable to such sublethal effects of predation.
   Nonetheless, we suspect that the types of sublethal costs of predator
   avoidance documented by this and other recent studies are nearly
   universal consequences of organisms foraging under predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding behavior of animals can be modified in response to hunger.
   This study examined how hunger influences striking, prey-handling, and
   venom expenditure by prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus v. viridis) feeding
   on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Eleven snakes were allowed to
   strike mice after seven and 28 days of food deprivation (i.e., well-fed
   and hungry conditions, respectively) in a repeated measures design.
   Hungry snakes were somewhat less successful in striking (more missed
   attempts), but the frequency of multiple bites, site struck, distance of
   strike, duration of strike, handling of prey (hold versus release), and
   latency to begin prey relocation (strike-induced chemosensory searching)
   did not vary between conditions. Hungry snakes expended less venom when
   securing prey than well-fed snakes, due perhaps to conservation of venom
   supplies or constraints on venom delivery. Performance of envenomated
   mice, including distance traveled and time to immobilization and death,
   did not differ between conditions. Apparently rattlesnakes do not
   respond to increased hunger by reducing the risks associated with the
   release and possible loss of envenomated rodent prey.}},

Abstract = {{Paltothyreus tarsatus workers show an adaptive predatory strategy

   insight learning involved in the quick modifications of predatory
   strategy enables P. tarsatus to hunt all available prey in a great
   diversity of sizes and species. Nevertheless, this generalist predator
   strongly preferred termites and very large prey such as giant diplopods
   and crickets to other choices within its diet. In the hunting of these
   favorite prey, the recruitment of nestmates enhanced the efficiency of
   total predation, though the release of a chemical trail appeared to
   depend on the hunger-satiety balance of the colony. In addition to the
   hunger, the miscapture of prey also triggered the release of chemical
   trails. The strategy for capturing grouped termites was characterized by
   the loading of multiple prey at a single time, by a concentrated search
   in a restricted area and by an optional recruitment of nestmates. These
   behavioral characteristics of ponerine ants probably account for the
   flexibility of their predatory strategy for hunting aggregated small

Abstract = {{This study aimed to assess the suitability of using video images to
   study social facilitation of feeding behaviour in domestic chickens
   (Gallus domesticus). A comparison was made between the chickens'
   responses to a real bird feeding in an adjacent cage (RB) and a video
   image of the same bird feeding, displayed on a television screen (VB).
   The amount of food consumed by the subject bird was significantly
   greater (P<0.05) during the RB treatment than when the stimulus cage was
   empty (RC). Likewise, the amount of food consumed was significantly
   greater (P<0.05) when the video and sound of a bird feeding (VB) was
   presented than when the video image was of an empty cage (VC). The
   number of food pecks, although greater in the RB than in the RC
   treatment (P<0.001 ), was not significantly different between the VB and
   VC treatments (P<0.07). Dividing each of the 30-min trials into three
   consecutive 10-min intervals and repeating the analysis, suggested that
   this lack of overall difference may have been due to the initial novelty
   of the television screen or to a delay in recognizing and responding to
   the video image since, by the final 10-min interval, the number of pecks
   was greater in the VB than in the VC treatment (P<0.05).
   It was concluded that video could be used to study social facilitation
   of feeding behaviour and, possibly also, of other behaviour patterns
   which occur less frequently or are not so easily elicited by prior
   deprivation. Video images may also provide an opportunity to identify
   the key stimuli in feeding behaviour that elicit the social
   facilitation, since the sequence of the behavioural components can be
   edited or the image experimentally manipulated independently of the
   behaviour of the subject bird.}},

Abstract = {{I used an observational and experimental approach to investigate the
   dietary consequences of substrate specialization in six species of
   Amazonian antwrens (Myrmotherula). Three species (leucophthalma,
   haematonota, and ornata) foraged exclusively at curled dead leaves
   suspended above ground, axillaris and longipennis foraged on live
   foliage, and hauxwelli was a substrate generalist, feeding at both live
   and dead foliage. Diet composition of all species was qualitatively
   similar, with soft-bodied orthopterans consistently the most important
   prey type. Dead-leaf specialists took other prey roughly in proportion
   to their availability in dead leaves, whereas diets of live-leaf
   foragers differed greatly from prey available on live foliage. Dead-leaf
   specialists also ate larger prey and especially larger orthopterans than
   did other antwrens. Substrate generalization in hauxwelli was associated
   with higher diet breadth and greater heterogeneity among individuals,
   compared with substrate-restricted foragers. Diet breadth was negatively
   correlated with prey size across all six species. When tested in outdoor
   cages, live-leaf foraging and generalist species showed little interest
   in dead- or live-leaf substrates, whereas all dead-leafers repeatedly
   inspected and manipulated dead and curled leaves in the absence of food.
   All foraging groups showed a similar degree of selectivity of prey types
   in feeding trials. Dead-leaf specialists did not differ from other
   species in their preference for orthopterans of different colors,
   although specialists were better able to catch and handle the largest
   katydids (>30 mm). Individual hauxwelli (the generalist) showed elevated
   levels of exploration at dead leaves with food reinforcement, suggesting
   short-term plasticity in search behavior. I conclude that substrate
   specialization in these birds involves fundamental differences in search
   behavior, but is not accompanied by equivalent changes in prey
   selectivity or preference. Dead-leaf specialists search for suitable
   substrates and then inspect them for hidden prey, taking prey roughly in
   proportion to their availability. In contrast live-leaf foragers search
   directly for prey and select suitable items from the wider array of
   arthropods available on live foliage. Substrate-restricted foraging may
   reduce diet breadth and promote diet stereotypy in both groups, whereas
   the single most important factor promoting specialization on dead leaves
   may be the predictable abundance of relatively large orthopterans.}},

Abstract = {{We use econometric techniques to consider whether the statistical

   fitting three equations using two-stage least squares or multiple
   regressions. The first equation explains how much people drink. The
   second and third equations explain fluctuations in systolic and
   diastolic blood pressures using information on the predicted values of
   the drinking variable from the first equation. Our results suggest that,

   observed covariates such as obesity, salt intake, schooling and so on,
   the strength of the statistical association between high blood pressure

   them. Our studies uncovered correlation between social organisation and
   quality of food and habitat. This led to comparisons between species and
   among populations, calling for experimental research both in large

Abstract = {{Workers of social insects are members of colonies that survive and
   reproduce together. Therefore, the behavioral activities of individual
   workers should be integrated with colony state. We here summarize and
   discuss the relationship between colony state and foraging behavior of
   individual workers under the provisional assumption that the colony is a
   unit. We argue that colony state can be described by a number of
   variables that should relate to fitness components in order to be
   meaningful. Among the possible candidates, colony population size seems
   to have an overriding importance in many respects, as shown by its
   relation to fitness components such as survival probability and
   reproductive performance. Other important variables include colony
   demography, i.e. caste or size distributions, nutritional status, or
   queen number. Each of these variables has been shown to affect fitness
   components; however, the evidence is rather scanty. We also discuss the
   evidence that variation in colony state variables relates to variation
   in individual worker behavior. Nutritional status (i.e. low or high
   levels of food stores) and colony size have been shown repeatedly to
   affect individual behavior. However, most of the evidence comes from the
   honey bee. Some studies suggest that behavioral responses are
   hierarchically structured. More work needs to be done to investigate the
   actual mechanisms of integration of individual behavior with colony
   state. Some knowledge has accumulated about the processes that govern
   recruitment to food sources. We conclude this review by discussing some
   concepts and problems for further research. These include the concept of
   a preferred colony state to which the colony should return after
   disturbance through the behavioral activities of the workers. Further
   theoretical elaboration and empirical investigations may help to
   elucidate whether this concept is useful and necessary. A largely
   neglected issue concerns the number versus effort problem, i.e. whether
   individuals should work harder or more workers should be allocated to a
   task that is in demand. We propose a simple scenario that suggests
   testable predictions. Finally, we discuss how colony state, individual
   work load, and the dependence of worker mortality rate on activity level
   may interact to generate different short-term foraging strategies that
   workers should adopt.}},

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour and microhabitat selection by brown trout in two streams
   presenting severe winter conditions, were investigated in south-central
   Norway. Fish were studied by direct underwater observation in different
   habitat types, during day and night, and with simultaneous sampling for
   dietary analysis and invertebrate drift.
   2. During the day in winter, brown trout exhibited two different
   behavioural strategies, depending on fish size. Smaller fish (<25 cm)
   sheltered passively in the substrate or in submerged vegetation, and
   were almost never active during daylight hours. This behaviour was
   consistent throughout the winter until water temperatures rose in
   spring. Larger trout (25-60 cm) were actively aggregating in deep-slow
   stream areas during the day.
   3. During the night the trout exhibited a third behavioural strategy.
   Fish were exposed and holding positions above or on the substrate. The
   trout were active throughout the night from dusk to dawn, and this
   behaviour was consistent throughout the winter.
   4. Measured microgradients in temperature did not affect spatial niche
   selection. Spatial niches at night were selected principally on the
   basis of focal microwater velocities. The fish minimized energy
   expenditure by selecting habitats with low water velocites (pools, back
   eddies, stream bank areas). When passively sheltering during the day,
   interstices in the substrate or macrophytes providing shelter were the
   more important microhabitat characteristic.
   5. Feeding continued at night during winter. However, the nocturnal
   activity pattern was not principally determined by food availability,
   since invertebrate drift did not show such periodicity.
   6. The behaviour and spatial niche selection by brown trout is explained
   as an ecologically adaptive homeostatic behavioural response to buffer
   the energy deficit and adverse environmental conditions experienced by
   the wintering fish. The nocturnal activity strategy reduces the risk of
   habitat exclusion and microhabitat inclusion by ice formation, and
   sheltering in the day reduces the energy expenditure and the risk of
   predation. Thus, the behaviour in winter is best described as a
   cost-minimizing shelter-and-move strategy.
   7. Little aggression in trout during winter suggests that social
   interactions may be less important as a factor regulating populations in
   winter than in summer. Instead, they may be more regulated by abiotic
   factors such as the physical structures of the stream.}},

Abstract = {{Background.-While some analytic studies have suggested that individuals
   in occupations representing higher compared with lower socioeconomic
   status have a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, it is unclear
   whether occupation itself has an etiologic role in the development of
   coronary heart disease or whether differences in as yet uncontrolled
   coronary risk factors may account for these differences in risk.
   Methods.-White-collar vs blue-collar occupation and risk of coronary
   heart disease was evaluated among 230 male patients hospitalized for a
   first myocardial infarction and 222 control subjects of the same age,
   sex, and neighborhood of residence. Information on coronary risk factors
   was obtained from home interviews, and blood specimens were drawn to
   test lipid and lipoprotein levels. Usual occupation was dichotomized
   into white-collar and blue-collar occupation according to the Edwards'
   classification.
   Results.-The relative risk of myocardial infarction of white-collar
   compared with blue-collar workers was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval,
   0.46 to 1.19) after controlling for age, cigarette smoking, family
   history of premature myocardial infarction, history of treatment for
   high blood pressure, body mass index, history of diabetes, alcohol
   consumption, type A personality, leisure-time physical activity, total
   calories, and percentage of calories consumed as saturated fat. However,
   there was no residual association after control for high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol yielding a relative risk of 0.98 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.63).
   Conclusions.-These results suggest that white-collar occupation per se
   does not appear to protect from coronary heart disease. Any apparent
   protective effect on myocardial infarction that has been previously
   observed in white-collar compared with blue-collar workers may be
   attributable to differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   levels.}},

   3. Larvae were less active when more food was available and
   predator-induced reductions in activity were negatively related to food
   availability. Larval activity was much higher in the dark than it was in
   the light.
   4. Over 7 days, presence of fish reduced the proportion of third-instar
   larvae that moulted but did not affect head width or dry mass; low food
   availability reduced the number of larvae that moulted as well as head
   width and dry mass of larvae in the fourth instar.
   5. Results indicate that the behavioural response of larval chironomids
   to predator presence depends strongly on environmental conditions and
   that estimating the developmental costs of these behavioural responses
   under field conditions will be complicated.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the action of central nervous system
   Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) in the control of feeding behavior
   the present studies employed a dietary self-selection task sensitive
   both to overall appetite as well as preferential intake of familiar
   versus unfamiliar foods. Prior to the diet selection test, one group of
   nutritionally stressed animals was fed a protein deficient diet in order
   to increase the preference for unfamiliar foods relative to
   nutritionally replete subjects. Both CRF (0.05 and 0.5 mug ICV) and
   physical restraint (30 min) attenuated selectively the consumption of a
   novel food choice by deficient animals without affecting concurrent
   intake of familiar food. Further, CRF administration did not alter water
   intake or consumption of either diet by the replete control group
   suggesting that the peptide produced a stress dependent, enhanced
   response to novelty without a general effect on appetite. The CRF
   antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (1, 5 and 25 mug ICV), increased
   familiar diet consumption in nutritionally deficient subjects without
   affecting the self-selection pattern or replete controls.
   Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) also increased selectively the intake of
   familiar food suggesting that this action is the anxiolytic complement
   of the effect of stress in this paradigm. The CRF antagonist (5 and 25
   mug) reversed the anorexia produced by CRF (0.5 mug) as well as that
   induced by restraint stress. These results favor a direct role for
   endogenous CRF systems in coordinating the behavioral responses to

Abstract = {{In the Negev desert of Israel, the pulmonate land snail Trochoidea

   histories. Specifically, we measured changes in feeding activity,
   overall activity levels, movement patterns and reproductive output. We
   found that snails on artificially-watered plots stopped feeding on
   higher plants and fed on soil-surface algae growing as a result of
   increased water availability. Most snails moved onto the watered plots,
   and reduced the total amount of movement once there, in response to
   increased food availability. Snails on the watered plots grew more and
   remained active for a longer period into the summer months than did
   snails on control plots. However, we found little evidence for the
   ability of these snails to alter their reproductive outputs in response
   to increased water (and hence food) availability. There was also no
   carry-over effect of high water availability in one season enhancing
   reproduction in the following season. We postulate that the low level of

   increased predation risk to avoid starvation. Observational and
   experimental data were gathered over a 2-yr period for a Great Basin

   manipulations of perceived risk using predator urines and simulated
   predator encounters with a dog (Canis familiaris). Compared to foraging
   animals, sleeping porcupines of all age classes avoided high risk (i.e.,
   open) areas. Mass loss varied by habitat with individuals foraging in
   open areas (high risk) experiencing less mass loss than those foraging
   in groves (low risk). Age class also affected habitat use by foraging
   porcupines. Juveniles invariably remained in low-risk areas, even when
   more risky habitats contained potentially better quality forage.
   Two-year-old porcupines shifted to high-risk areas as body condition

   safety and food. I consider within a common framework four ways of
   modeling how safety and energy influence fitness. These models make
   similar predictions for when a forager should stop feeding from
   depletable patches that vary in predation risk. In accord with Brown
   (1988), patches should be abandoned when the harvest rate no longer
   compensates for the metabolic, predation, and missed opportunity costs
   of foraging. In accord with Gilliam \& Fraser (1987), safe and risky
   patches should be left at the same ratio of predation risk to net
   feeding rate when the alternative activities include resting in a safe
   refuge to save energy. The quitting harvest rate of the forager within a
   food patch should be sensitive to predation risk and to the marginal
   value of food (the fitness value of an additional food item). Quitting
   harvest rates should be higher in food patches with higher predation
   risk. Quitting harvest rates and the costs of predation should increase
   as the marginal value of food decreases. The difference in quitting
   harvest rates between patches with high and low predation risk should
   increase as the marginal value of food decreases. Fortunately, the
   shared qualitative predictions of these models have and can be tested.
   Unfortunately, distinguishing among die models' differing quantitative
   predictions shall prove challenging.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{717-733}},
Abstract = {{1. We conducted a 2-year study of Anolis nebulosus Weigman with the aim
   of understanding the effects of seasonality and predation on the
   behaviour of this tropical, mainland anole. The study was carried out in
   a deciduous forest at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela on the Pacific
   coast of Mexico. This area has a severe 6-7 month dry season and the
   largest seasonal fluctuations in arthropod numbers and biomass yet
   recorded for a tropical habitat. As is characteristic of mainland
   anoles, the A. nebulosus population in the Chamela forest experiences
   high predation rates and low annual survivorship.
   2. Our results indicate that seasonality and predation are major forces
   shaping the foraging strategies, activity levels, and social behaviour
   of A. nebulosus. In response to the wet season flush of insects, males
   and females shift from ground to arboreal foraging and increase feeding
   rates 5-10-fold. Males also travel further to capture prey and change
   their foraging mode, switching from trunk-ground, sit-and-wait foraging
   in the dry season to trunk-crown, mobile foraging in the wet season.
   3. During the dry season, male and female A. nebulosus are the most
   sedentary lizards known, moving only once or twice per hour, and
   travelling a maximum of 8-9 m day- 1. During the wet season females are
   2-3 times and males 5-10 times more active. Following the brief breeding
   period, however, both males and females retreat into unexposed hiding
   places and are emergent and active for only 1 or 2 days week-1. This
   reclusive behaviour and the exceptional levels of inactivity found in
   this species are most likely adaptations that reduce the risk of
   predation.
   4. During the wet season breeding period, male A. nebulosus increase
   display rates 15-30-fold and expand their home ranges 10-15-fold.
   Compared to insular populations of A. nebulosus, however, the Chamela
   males invest significantly less time courting females (49\% vs. 95\%)
   and more time hiding and resting (44\% vs. 1\%). Such differences
   suggest that mainland males are trading off the probability of
   encountering and mating with females for enhanced safety.
   5. Time budget analysis reveals that females devote more time to
   foraging than males during both wet and dry seasons. This strategy may
   enhance female fitness by increasing growth rate, fat reserves, and egg
   production. Males divide their time equally between resting/hiding and
   foraging and allocate only a small proportion of their day to social
   activities, except during the breeding period when the majority of their
   time and energy is invested in reproductive behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The hermit crab Pagurus acadianus (Benedict) possesses two major
   defences against mobile aquatic predators, viz., fleeing and refuging in
   its gastropod shell.  When approached by a potential predator, a crab
   must choose to either continue its current activity (e.g., feeding),
   flee or hide in its shell.  If a foraging crab flees when threatened, it
   must secondarily decide whether to carry its food item and, if so, how
   far to carry it whilst escaping.  Alternatively, if the crab takes
   refuge in its shell, it must then decide how long to remain hidden and
   when to resume locomotory activity following emergence from the shell. 
   Because these behavioural alternatives have associated costs (e.g.,
   energy expenditure, predation risk, lost foraging opportunity), the
   crabs' decision as to which behaviour to adopt should be sensitive to
   the respective cost of each.  We tested specific predictions of this
   general economic hypothesis of behavioural decision making by varying
   the weight of food items presented to crabs (= lost feeding opportunity
   cost, energetic cost of carry) and the amount of time the crabs were
   ``handled{''} by a predator following ``capture{''} (= predation risk). 
   Most crabs tested fled from an approaching lobster predator model. 
   Contrary to expectation, flight initiation distance was unaffected by
   the mass of the food item available to the foraging crabs.  As
   predicted, however, the distances fleeing crabs carried individual food
   items varied inversely with the food's weight.  Time spent hiding in the
   shell and latency to resume locomotion following a predator ``attack{''}
   were relatively unaffected by the size of the food item available.  As
   expected, the crabs' decision to emerge from their shell following a
   threat appeared sensitive to their perceived risk of predation, as
   evidenced by an observed positive relationship between refuging time (in
   shell) and the duration of preceding handling of the crab by the
   predator.  These findings are interpreted within the cost-benefit
   framework of behavioural decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Few experimental studies of mating behavior have examined mating
   behavior shifts in response to ecological factors (e.g., predators,

   trade-offs between predator avoidance, feeding behavior, and copulation
   duration in a semiaquatic insect (Microvelia austrina); and (2) address
   the influence of altered copulation duration on male reproductive
   success. To examine multiple trade-offs, we used a 2 x 2 factorial
   design where we measured the amount of time that mating microveliids
   remained in tandem, for starved and fed microveliids in the presence and
   absence of predaceous water striders (Gerris remigis). We also looked at
   the effects of presence vs. absence of green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus)
   on microveliid tandem duration. To address the impact of premature pair
   separation on male mating success, we separated paired microveliids in
   field populations and measured the time required for each sex to find
   new mates. To examine the effects of local sex ratio on remating times
   of males and females, we quantified the sex ratio of field populations
   via periodic censuses and correlated local sex ratio with remating
   times. Finally, to address oviposition rates while pairs are in tandem,
   we measured female oviposition patterns relative to tandem duration for
   poorly fed and well-fed females.
   Both starvation and gerrid presence significantly reduced tandem
   duration. As a result of male-biased sex ratios, males that prematurely
   separated from females often faced long search times before securing a
   new mate. Females oviposited at a constant rate while in tandem. A
   simple computer simulation incorporating the above observations suggests
   that reductions in tandem duration can decrease fertilization rates.}},

Abstract = {{We examined environmental effects on the correlation between age and
   size at metamorphosis in spadefoot toad tadpoles (Scaphiopus
   multiplicatus). These tadpoles occur in ponds of variable duration as
   two environmentally induced, trophic morphs: a large, rapidly developing
   carnivore morph and a smaller, more slowly developing omnivore morph.
   Drawing on data from both natural ponds and artificial pools we examined
   for both morphs the environmental determinants of, and the
   intercorrelations among, three life history parameters: age at
   metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis, and survivorship (both pre- and
   postmetamorphic). Censuses of four natural ponds revealed that age and
   size at metamorphosis for both morphs were inversely related, in
   contrast to many other amphibians and insects with complex life cycles.
   In artificial pools in which we simultaneously varied two diet
   components and pond duration, age and size at metamorphosis were
   negatively correlated in high food treatments and positively correlated
   in low food, long pond duration treatments. Ephemeral larval habitats
   should favor rapid differentiation; achieving large body size depends
   upon the quality and quantity of available food and the time available
   to develop. A negative relationship between age and size at
   metamorphosis may occur often in S. multiplicatus since this species is
   exposed to a rapidly diminishing food resource (anostracans). We predict
   that other organisms with complex life cycles faced with these
   conditions would possess an inverse relationship between size and age at
   metamorphosis.}},

Abstract = {{The behavioral reactivity in an ``open-field{''} test and plasma
   cortisol levels were studied in 72 pigs from 12 litters fed for 3 wk one
   of three diets with different levels of tryptophan:  deficient (.14\%),

   performed three times:  5 d (day W + 5), 23 d (day W + 23) and 45 d (day
   W + 45) after weaning.  The exploration time and the number of grunts
   provided an adequate measure of the individual emotional reactivity at
   day W + 5.  Significant correlations were obtained between exploration
   time and the number of grunts at each time (r = -.83 at day W + 5; r =
   -.46 at day W + 23; r = -.71 at day W + 45).  The distinction between
   animals remained (P < .05) in terms of exploration time at both 23 and
   45 d after weaning.  At day W + 23, exploration time was lower in the
   group fed the adequate diet than in the two other groups.  This effect
   was maintained subsequently after feeding all pigs the same adequate
   diet (day W + 45).  In 36 pigs slaughtered at day W + 23, brain TRP
   concentration was higher with the excess dietary TRP than with deficient
   or adequate levels.  Conversely, other plasma amino acids (particularly
   threonine) accumulated only in the brains of pigs fed the deficient
   diet.  Plasma cortisol level assayed at weaning (W) and 2 wk later
   increased with age and was higher in 16-h fasted (day W + 15) than in
   3-h fasted (day W + 17) pigs.  Correlations were observed within litters
   in the fasting state, between the cortisol level and behavioral traits
   measured at day W + 23 (r = .70 for number of grunts, r = -.60 for
   exploration time).  Dietary TRP did not affect the plasma cortisol level
   irrespective of the nutritional state after weaning.  However, an
   interaction was noted between plasma cortisol and TRP status (P < .05). 
   Although dietary TRP induced large variations in brain amino acids and
   5-hydroxyindole concentrations, changes in behavioral and cortisol

Abstract = {{Foraging animals will behave in such a way that they maximize foraging
   efficiency while minimizing risk to predation.  Using a behavioral
   paradigm in which laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus) were provided with
   food at one end of an elevated beam and a refuge to which they could
   carry the food at the other end of the beam, we examined the effects of
   travel distance, travel difficulty, ambient lighting, predation risk,
   and food size on foraging behavior.  Both lengthening travel distance
   (by increasing beam length) and increasing travel difficulty (by
   decreasing beam width) decreased food carrying.  When plotted as a
   function of travel time, the effects of the two treatments appeared to
   be partly different.  Decreasing ambient illumination decreased food
   carrying, although the rats still responded to distance and food size. 
   In contrast, predator's odor (cat) stopped foraging altogether.  When a
   store of small food pellets was available, the rats ate for prolonged
   periods in the open, and eating time increased with travel distance;
   however, when large food pellets were also available, the rats
   immediately selected and carried them to the refuge.  The experiments
   show that food-carrying behavior in the rat is influenced by a variety
   of independently acting factors, which include eating time, food size,
   travel distance, travel risk, illumination, predation, and exposure
   time.  The varied and flexible foraging behavior of the animals is
   discussed in relation to optimal foraging theory.}},

Abstract = {{Background. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host
   resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively
   studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of
   documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to
   respiratory viruses.
   Methods. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of
   psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops
   containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14,
   respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an
   additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then
   quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection
   and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the
   presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an
   increase in the virus-specific antibody titer.
   Results. The rates of both respiratory infection (P < 0.005) and
   clinical colds (P < 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with
   increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged
   from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to
   levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds
   ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were
   not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status,
   weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the
   infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and
   virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge).
   Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge
   viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking,
   alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell
   counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association
   between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality
   variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion)
   failed to alter our findings.
   Conclusions. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response
   manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness,
   and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather
   than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental tests of the hypothesis that natural selection favors

   nutritional value.  Behavioral observations and experiments documented
   that Z. mali does not detect kariomones of the prey species.  Therefore,
   prey location is due only to random encounters.  Apparently, Z. mali

Abstract = {{Comparison of the size, shape and shell morphology in littoral and
   sub-littoral morphs of the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna reveal
   differences in shell morphology which are enhanced by structural
   anomalies within the shells of the two types.  Infestation of
   sub-littoral shells by the conchocelis phase of an endolithic alga
   significantly affects shell density and total chlorophyll levels in the
   two shell morphs.  The surface sculpture of sub-littoral shells is
   characterised by a series of grooves, the configuration of which closely
   resembles that of the radular teeth in N. concinna.  Limpets utilise the
   available food supply within the shell matrix of other limpets by
   grazing the shell material.  Epibiotic growth of calcareous algae
   prevent erosion and preserve underlying shell layers.  In severe cases,
   where protection is lacking, intraspecific shell grazing may remove
   parts of the shell exposing the internal tissues.
   The Dominican Gull, Larus dominicanus, is a major shore predator of both
   shell morphs.  Gull middens contain both shell types but are dominated
   by the more accessible littoral shells.  Comparison of living
   populations and midden assemblages indicates that size and shape
   selection of prey occurs, with pear-shaped limpets between 21 mm and 29
   mm in length being taken preferentially.
   Apparent differences in shell form are induced by physical, biological
   and behavioural influences.  Littoral animals are robust in nature,
   resist avian predation and are not extensively grazed whereas those of
   the sub-littoral are not subject to the same degree of predatory
   attention but suffer a gradual depletion of their shallower shell form
   through a combination of algal infection and intraspecific shell
   grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Distinct behavioural strategies for dealing with environmental and
   social challenge are known to exist in the adults of a variety of
   mammalian species, but little is known about the developmental bases of
   these strategies.  In an attempt to start to fill this gap in knowledge,
   the present study set out to describe and compare the development of
   males from two lines of wild house mice which are known to differ in
   their aggressive behaviour and response to challenging situations. 
   Adult males from one line (Short Attack Latency = SAL line) are more
   aggressive, show less sensitivity to changes in their environment and
   behave in a more internally controlled, routine-like way, than do males
   from the other line (outbred = Control line).  The parental care and
   development of eight litters of four male pups from each line was
   observed.
   Paternal care did not differ between the two lines, but SAL pups
   received higher levels of nursing and general maternal care than did
   Control pups, and they appeared to be weaned later. Despite these
   differences, SAL pups grew more slowly than Control pups, suggesting
   that their high levels of sucking behaviour were a reflection of high
   milk demand, perhaps due to a low milk supply, rather than high milk
   intake.  SAL pups were also delayed in a number of measures of early
   behavioural development relative to Control pups.
   The apparent early retardation in certain measures of SAL pup
   behavioural development disappeared at the end of the parental care
   period.  From day 32 onwards, SAL pups began to show higher levels of
   aggression towards each other than did Control pups, and also showed a
   reduced reactivity to tests involving changes to the home cage
   environment; a characteristic of adult SAL males.
   As expected, SAL males developed into faster attackers than Control
   males and, in SAL litters, intra-litter variation in attack speed was
   strongly influenced by preceding experience of sibling aggression.  The
   fastest attackers in each litter were more successful in fights
   occurring in their litter than their slowest attacking siblings.  No
   such relationship was observed in the Control litters where levels of
   inter-sibling aggression were low.
   The results point to the potential significance of maternal care
   behaviour and pup fighting behaviour in the development of the
   fast-attacking phenotype.  One hypothesis is that inadequate nutrition
   of young SAL pups, mediated through the mother, promotes increased
   competition for access to the mother's nipples and predisposes the pups
   to develop into more active/competitive individuals.  Subsequent
   sibling-sibling aggression appears to influence intra-litter variation
   in adult attack latency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a series of simulations designed to determine

   The resulting mean-variance sets assumed three distinct shapes:

   mean-variance sets allow the forager to employ simple behavioural rules
   to determine the optimal diet breadth.  This situation occurs when low
   ranking diet items have small handling times, and these conditions may
   be quite common.  In other cases, mean-variance sets may be too
   complicated to allow for easy behavioural rules designed to minimize
   starvation probability.  The ability to characterize foraging problems
   into a limited series of mean-variance set types benefits workers
   examining the evolution and maintenance of foraging strategies, since
   these sets have clear implications for the ability of animals to develop
   simple behavioural rules.  Unfortunately data are lacking on the

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{163-169}},
Abstract = {{Mayfly larvae of Paraleptophlebia heteronea (McDunnough) had two
   antipredator responses to a nocturnal fish predator (Rhinichthys
   cataractae (Valenciennes)):  flight into the drift and retreat into
   interstitial crevices.  Drift rates of Paraleptophelbia abruptly
   increased by 30 fold when fish were actively foraging in the laboratory
   streams but, even before fish were removed, drift began returning to
   control levels because larvae settled to the substrate and moved to
   areas of low risk beneath stones.  This drifting response was used as an
   immediate escape behaviour which likely decreases risk of capture from
   predators which forage actively at night.  Surprisingly, drift most
   often occurred before contact between predator and prey, and we suggest
   that in darkness this mayfly may use hydrodynamic pressure waves for
   predator detection, rather than chemical cues, since fish forage in an
   upstream direction.  Although drifting may represent a cost to mayfly
   larvae in terms of relocation to a new foraging area with unknown food
   resources, the immediate mortality risk probably out-weighs the
   importance of staying within a profitable food patch because larvae can
   survive starvation for at least 2 d.  In addition to drifting, mayflies
   retreated from upper, exposed substrate surfaces to concealed
   interstitial crevices immediately after a predator encounter, or
   subsequent to resettlement on the substrate after predator-induced
   drift.  A latency period was associated with this response and mayflies
   remained in these concealed locations for at least 3 h after dace
   foraging ceased.  Because this mayfly feeds at night and food levels are
   significantly lower in field refugia under stones, relative to exposed
   stone surfaces, predator avoidance activity may limit foraging time and,
   ultimately, reduce the food intake of this stream mayfly.}},

   In the present study, food-deprived rats were tested in an operant
   chamber in which the animals had a choice between pressing a lever to
   obtain a more-preferred food (Bioserve pellets), or free feeding on a
   less-preferred food (lab chow). Typically, rats pressed the lever to
   obtain the preferred food pellets, and ate little of the less-preferred
   food even though it was freely available. Pre-fed rats showed
   suppression of both lever pressing and feeding. Systemic administration
   of 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol (HP) led to a dramatic shift in the behavior of
   these rats, such that the number of lever presses was substantially
   reduced, but the amount of less-preferred food consumed showed a
   significant increase. This result occurred if the rats pressed a lever
   on either a CRF or FR5 schedule. Injection of 3.5-7.0-mu-g HP directly
   into the nucleus accumbens, or intra-accumbens injections of
   6-hydroxydopamine, also decreased lever pressing for food and increased
   feeding on laboratory chow. Thus, interference with brain dopamine
   suppressed a highly active instrumental response for food, although the
   behavior of the animal was still directed towards food acquisition and
