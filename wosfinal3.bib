Abstract = {{Reproductive success is a critical fitness attribute that is directly
   influenced by resource availability. Here, we investigate the effects of
   diet-based resource availability on three interrelated aspects of
   reproductive success: a change in mating system based on mate
   availability, consequent inbreeding depression, and the deterioration of
   reproductive efficiency with age (senescence). We employed a factorial
   experimental design using 22 full-sib families of the hermaphroditic
   freshwater snail Physa acuta to explore these interactions. Individual
   snails were reared in one of two mate-availability treatments (isolated
   {[}selfing] or occasionally paired {[}outcrossing]) and one of two diet
   treatments (boiled lettuce or Spirulina, an algae that is rich in
   protein, vitamins, and minerals). Spirulina-fed snails initiated
   reproduction at a 13\% earlier age and 7\% larger size than lettuce-fed
   snails. Spirulina also resulted in a 30\% reduction in the time delay
   before selfing. Compared to lettuce, a diet of Spirulina increased
   inbreeding depression by 52\% for egg hatching rate and 64\% for
   posthatching juvenile survival. Furthermore, Spirulina led to a 15-fold
   increase in the rate of reproductive senescence compared with a diet of
   lettuce. These transgenerational, interactive effects of diet on
   inbreeding depression and reproductive senescence are discussed in the
   context of diet-induced phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization poses serious extinction risks, yet some species thrive in
   urban environments. This may be due to a pronounced developmental
   plasticity in these taxa, since phenotypically, plastic organisms may
   better adjust to unpredictable urban food resources. We studied
   phenotypic plasticity in Nuctenea umbratica, a common European forest
   and urban vegetation spider. We subjected spiderlings to low (LF),
   medium (MF) and high (HF) food treatments and documented their growth
   and developmental trajectories into adulthood. Spiders from the three
   treatments had comparable numbers of instars and growth ratios, but
   differed in developmental periods. Longest developing LF spiders (a (TM)
   EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 390, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 320
   days) had the smallest adults, but MF (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per
   thousand= 300, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 240 days) and HF (a (TM)
   EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 240, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 210
   days) spiders reached comparable adult sizes through shorter
   development. While males and females had comparable instar numbers,
   females had longer development, higher growth ratios, adult sizes and
   mass; and while males adjusted their moulting to food availability,
   female moulting depended on specific mass, not food treatment. We
   discussed the patterns of Nuctenea sex-specific development and compared
   our results with published data on two other Holarctic urban colonizers
   (Larinioides sclopetarius, Zygiella x-notata) exhibiting high plasticity
   and fast generation turn-over. We conclude that despite relatively
   unconstrained developmental time in the laboratory enabling Nuctenea to
   achieve maximal mass and size-main female fitness proxies-their
   relatively fixed growth ratio and long generation turn-over may explain
   their lower success in urban environments.}},

Title = {{Ectoparasites modify escape behaviour, but not performance, in a coral
   reef fish}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Survival depends on escape responses and when to flee a predator. As a
   result, factors affecting the escape performance of prey species,
   including parasite infection, may profoundly influence the outcome of
   predator-prey encounters. Several hypotheses predict the responses of
   prey to simulated predator attacks based on intrinsic characteristics
   such as individual reproductive value and flight costs: as predation
   risk and reproductive value increase, so should the distance at which an
   organism begins to flee an escaping predator (flight initiation
   distance; FID). Conversely, FID should decrease if the costs of fleeing
   are high. Despite providing testable hypotheses, rarely have these
   theories been used to predict the escape behaviour of parasitized
   individuals. The bridled monocle bream, Scolopsis bilineata, is
   parasitized by a large cymothoid isopod, Anilocra nemipteri, which
   attaches above the eye. In this species, ectoparasite infection is
   associated with increased energy costs and decreased endurance. We
   investigated the effects of infection on escape performance and FID.
   Maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, cumulative distance travelled
   and response latency did not differ between parasitized fish,
   unparasitized fish and fish that had their parasite experimentally
   removed. Parasitized fish were smaller, on average, than unparasitized
   individuals. Smaller, parasitized individuals allowed a threat to
   approach closer before fleeing (shorter FID) than larger parasitized or
   uninfected individuals. Since parasite infection has known effects on
   host growth and metabolism, we suggest that parasitism alters fish
   escape behaviour as predicted by two nonexclusive hypotheses: (1) by
   decreasing reproductive value (the asset protection hypothesis) and (2)
   by increasing the relative costs of fleeing (the economic hypothesis)
   compared with uninfected and large parasitized fish. The relative
   importance of each hypothesis in driving the trends observed remains to
   be tested. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{69-76}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Wormlion larvae (Diptera: Vermileonidae) construct conical pits in fine
   loose soils and ambush arthropod prey. Their hunting strategy resembles
   that of pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrme-leontidae), offering a
   classical example of convergent evolution, as they belong to different
   orders of insects. However, compared with other trap-building predators,
   spiders and antlions, the foraging behaviour of wormlions is almost
   unknown. In this study we used a combination of field observations and
   laboratory experiments to close this gap and investigate how hunger and
   ecological factors such as density and spatial pattern affect pit size,
   that is, how they shape investment in foraging and indicate competition
   between neighbouring larvae. We found slight, mainly decreasing, changes
   in pit size with hunger, with no change in response to prey.
   Surprisingly, body mass and length were not tightly correlated with pit
   size, unlike in antlions and spiders. Other factors, in addition to body
   mass and size, affect pit size, as the correlation between pits
   constructed in the field and in the laboratory was strong. The evidence
   for competition was mixed. On the one hand, we detected, in the
   laboratory, a change towards a regular spatial pattern with increasing
   pit densities, as expected, suggesting interference competition. On the
   other hand, we detected, in the field, a positive correlation between
   the sizes of neighbouring pits, and a negative correlation in the
   laboratory between pit size and distance to the nearest neighbour, both
   indicating clustering in favourable microhabitats, and not supporting
   strong competition. We discuss our findings in comparison with other
   trap-building predators and locate them within the general framework of
   foraging theory. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{237-242}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in physiology and behaviour can have strong effects
   on ecological and evolutionary processes. Natal habitat, one source of
   individual variation, can influence individual phenotype, behaviour and
   fitness through effects on eventual habitat selection. Natal habitat
   preference induction occurs when individuals match stimuli in their
   selected habitat to those of their natal habitat. Natal habitat can also
   affect habitat selection through its influence on body condition (silver
   spoon effect). We tested for natal habitat preference induction and
   body-condition-dependent habitat selection in two species with complex
   life histories, the spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, and the
   small-mouthed salamander, Ambystoma texanum. We reared salamanders from
   hatchlings in mesocosms with leaf, grass or control substrate, and
   tested juvenile habitat selection through two behavioural assays. We
   found weak evidence of larger salamanders having decreased latency and
   sampling more habitats, lending support to the body-condition-dependent
   habitat selection hypothesis in these species. Juveniles preferred grass
   litter cues regardless of the substrate in their natal mesocosm,
   suggesting natal habitat preference induction may not occur in species
   with complex life histories. We propose that species with complex life
   histories use simple movement rules, such as moving along habitat
   gradients, to select postnatal habitat when moving through a novel
   environment. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Early human food cultures were plant-based. Major religions such as
   Hinduism and Buddhism have recommended a vegetarian way of life since
   their conception. The recorded history of vegetarian nutrition started
   in the sixth century BC by followers of the Orphic mysteries. The Greek
   philosopher Pythagoras is considered the father of ethical
   vegetarianism. The Pythagorean way of life was followed by a number of
   important personalities and influenced vegetarian nutrition until the
   19th century. In Europe, vegetarian nutrition more or less disappeared
   during the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance era and in the Age of
   Enlightenment, various personalities practiced vegetarianism. The first
   vegetarian society was started in England in 1847. The International
   Vegetarian Society was founded in 1908 and the first vegan society began
   in 1944. Prominent vegetarians during this time included Sylvester
   Graham, John Harvey Kellogg, and Maximilian Bircher-Benner. A paradigm
   shift occurred at the turn of the 21st century. The former prejudices
   that vegetarianism leads to malnutrition were replaced by scientific
   evidence showing that vegetarian nutrition reduces the risk of most
   contemporary diseases. Today, vegetarian nutrition has a growing
   international following and is increasingly accepted. The main reasons
   for this trend are health concerns and ethical, ecologic, and social
   issues. The future of vegetarian nutrition is promising because
   sustainable nutrition is crucial for the well-being of humankind. An
   increasing number of people do not want animals to suffer nor do they
   want climate change; they want to avoid preventable diseases and to
   secure a livable future for generations to come.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increased attention to the role of temperament in children's
   obesogenic eating behaviors, there is a paucity of research examining
   whether different dimensions of temperament may be differentially
   associated with specific eating behaviors among preschool-age children.
   The purpose of the current study was to examine whether three
   temperament dimensions (surgency, negative affectivity, and effortful
   control) were uniquely associated with six obesogenic eating behaviors
   (caregiver-reported food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional
   overeating, satiety responsiveness, and tantrums over food; and observed
   eating in the absence of hunger) among low-income preschool-age
   children, covarying home environment quality. Results showed that
   temperament dimensions were differentially associated with different
   eating behaviors. Specifically, preschoolers with higher surgency were
   more likely to overeat in response to external cues, have frequent
   desire to eat, derive pleasure from food, and eat in the absence of
   hunger. In contrast, preschoolers with higher negative affectivity were
   more likely to have tantrums over being denied food and less likely to
   eat in the absence of hunger. Effortful control was not uniquely
   associated with obesogenic eating behavior. Findings remained
   significant even when home chaos was accounted for, suggesting that
   child surgency and negative affectivity are important to consider,
   independent of home environment. Results are discussed with regard to
   theoretical implications for the study of childhood obesity and for

Abstract = {{The influence of environmental change on species interactions will
   affect population dynamics and community structure in the future, but
   our current understanding of the outcomes of species interactions in a
   high-CO2 world is limited. Here, we draw upon emerging experimental
   research examining the effects of ocean acidification on coastal
   molluscs to provide hypotheses of the potential impacts of high-CO2 on
   predator-prey interactions. Coastal molluscs, such as oysters, mussels,
   and snails, allocate energy among defenses, growth, and reproduction.
   Ocean acidification increases the energetic costs of physiological
   processes such as acid-base regulation and calcification. Impacted
   molluscs can display complex and divergent patterns of energy allocation
   to defenses and growth that may influence predator-prey interactions;
   these include changes in shell properties, body size, tissue mass,
   immune function, or reproductive output. Ocean acidification has also
   been shown to induce complex changes in chemoreception, behavior, and
   inducible defenses, including altered cue detection and predator
   avoidance behaviors. Each of these responses may ultimately alter the
   susceptibility of coastal molluscs to predation through effects on
   predator handling time, satiation, and search time. While many of these
   effects may manifest as increases in per capita predation rates on
   coastal molluscs, the ultimate outcome of predator-prey interactions
   will also depend on how ocean acidification affects the specified
   predators, which also exhibit complex responses to ocean acidification.
   Changes in predator-prey interactions could have profound and unexplored
   consequences for the population dynamics of coastal molluscs in a
   high-CO2 ocean.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Human modification of habitats can reduce reproductive success by
   providing novel cues to which birds may respond with behaviors that are
   actually maladaptive in those environments. Ad libitum human-provided
   foods may provide the perception that urban habitats are food-rich even
   as natural food availability decreases. Similarly, human activity may
   increase the perception that predation risk is high even as natural
   predators may decrease in abundance. In response, birds may reduce
   parental care with a subsequent cost to successful reproduction. Florida
   Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in suburban areas have lower nest
   success during the nestling period than do wildland jays, possibly the
   result of such maladaptive responses, but maybe because of ecological
   differences with wildlands. We manipulated adult perception of predation
   risk and the availability of nestling foods in suburban and wildland
   areas to determine if these factors influenced parental care and
   nestling begging, and if the behavioral responses of adults influence
   nest survival during the nestling stage. Experimentally increasing
   perception of predation risk reduced parental care by both suburban and
   wildland females, but did not influence care by males. Increasing food
   availability, but not predation risk, had little influence on parental
   care, but resulted in decreased nestling begging rates and an increase
   in the frequency (pitch) of begging calls in both habitats. However,
   neither parental care nor food availability influenced nest survival
   during the nestling stage. Instead, the presence of helpers was the most
   important variable in nest survival analyses, suggesting that
   habitat-specific differences in nest survival during the nestling stage
   were not simply the result of maladaptive parental behavior or shortage
   of nestling food resources in the suburban habitat. The lack of helpers
   combined with ecological differences, such as the abundance of nest
   predators, may be why fewer nests of Florida Scrub-Jays survive during
   this stage in suburban areas.}},

Pages = {{63-71}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The `cognitive capacity hypothesis' states that song complexity could
   potentially be used by prospective mates to assess an individual's
   overall cognitive ability. Several recent studies have provided support
   for the cognitive capacity hypothesis, demonstrating that individuals
   with more complex songs or larger song repertoires performed better on
   various learning tasks. These studies all measured individuals' learning
   performance in social isolation. However, for gregarious species such as
   the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, testing individuals in a group
   context is socially and ecologically more relevant if song complexity is
   to be a meaningful indicator of cognitive ability. We tested whether
   song complexity correlated with performance on a suite of novel foraging
   problems in flocks of male zebra finches, starting by replicating the
   lid-flipping task used by Boogert et al. (Animal Behaviour, 2008, 76,
   1735-1741), who provided the first support for the cognitive capacity
   hypothesis in zebra finches isolated during testing. We also presented
   flocks with a barrier task and two types of novel food. We found that
   males' song complexity scores did not correlate with their latency to
   solve any of these novel foraging problems in a social context.
   Individuals that solved the tasks likewise did not have more complex
   songs than nonsolvers. However, performance was positively correlated
   across the different foraging tasks. These results raise doubts as to
   whether the song complexity measures used by Boogert et al. are
   predictors of problem- solving performance, and perhaps cognitive
   ability, in a more ecologically relevant, social setting. Stress
   responsiveness might instead explain the association between song
   complexity and foraging task performance among isolated zebra finches

   of ungulate and plant food distribution as well as risks of detection by
   humans and other carnivores on consumption site choice, and evaluated
   which factors best explain grizzly bear food-caching behaviour.
   Ungulates were consumed in forested areas, close to edges, and where
   horizontal cover was high, whereby vegetation impeded visibility of the
   ungulate carcass. Distance to roads had no effect on the distribution of
   prey consumption sites, but carcasses were further from trails than
   expected. Models incorporating presence/absence of key non-ungulate bear
   foods had little weight of evidence (w(i) <= 0.01). Food-caching
   behaviour did not appear to be related to variation in resource
   availability or risk of food spoilage but was significantly influenced
   by prey size. Although bears chose sites that minimized detection risk,
   spent more time at larger carcasses and cached 75.9\% of ungulates, 50\%
   of consumption sites had other carnivore sign, which was more likely to
   be present at large carcasses. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The global pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is often causally
   linked to marked changes in diet and lifestyle; namely marked increases
   in dietary intakes of high energy diets and concomitant reductions in
   physical activity levels. However, less attention has been paid to the
   role of developmental plasticity and alterations in phenotypic outcomes
   resulting from altered environmental conditions during the early life
   period. Human and experimental animal studies have highlighted the link
   between alterations in the early life environment and increased risk of
   obesity and metabolic disorders in later life. This link is
   conceptualised as the developmental programming hypothesis whereby
   environmental influences during critical periods of developmental
   plasticity can elicit lifelong effects on the health and well-being of
   the offspring. In particular, the nutritional environment in which the
   fetus or infant develops influences the risk of metabolic disorders in
   offspring. The late onset of such diseases in response to earlier
   transient experiences has led to the suggestion that developmental
   programming may have an epigenetic component, as epigenetic marks such
   as DNA methylation or histone tail modifications could provide a
   persistent memory of earlier nutritional states. Moreover, evidence
   exists, at least from animal models, that such epigenetic programming
   should be viewed as a transgenerational phenomenon. However, the
   mechanisms by which early environmental insults can have long-term
   effects on offspring are relatively unclear. Thus far, these mechanisms
   include permanent structural changes to the organ caused by suboptimal
   levels of an important factor during a critical developmental period,
   changes in gene expression caused by epigenetic modifications (including
   DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA) and permanent
   changes in cellular ageing. A better understanding of the epigenetic
   basis of developmental programming and how these effects may be
   transmitted across generations is essential for the implementation of
   initiatives aimed at curbing the current obesity and diabetes crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Although many studies have been carried out on plant-animal mutualistic
   assemblages, the roles of functional traits and taxonomy in determining
   both whether interactions involve mutualisms or predation and the
   structure of such assemblages are unclear. We used semi-natural
   enclosures to quantitatively assess the interaction strengths between
   seeds of 8 sympatric tree species and 4 rodent species in a tropical
   forest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, Southwest China. We found 2 clusters of
   species in the seed-rodent network represented by 2 genera in the
   Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus). Compared to seeds of 3 Castanopsis
   species, seeds with heavy weight, hard coat or caloric content
   (including 3 Lithocarpus species) were eaten less and more frequently
   hoarded by rodents. In turn, hoarded seeds showed less predation and
   more mutualism with rodents. Our results suggest that seed traits
   significantly affected the hoarding behavior of rodents, and,
   consequently, the occurrence of mutualisms and predation as well as
   assemblage structure in the plant-animal seed dispersal system.
   Taxonomically-related species with similar seed traits as functional
   groups belong to the same substructures in the assemblage. Our results

Abstract = {{Many forms of developmental plasticity have been observed and these are
   usually beneficial to the organism. The Predictive Adaptive Response
   (PAR) hypothesis refers to a form of developmental plasticity in which
   cues received in early life influence the development of a phenotype
   that is normally adapted to the environmental conditions of later life.
   When the predicted and actual environments differ, the mismatch between
   the individual's phenotype and the conditions in which it finds itself
   can have adverse consequences for Darwinian fitness and, later, for
   health. Numerous examples exist of the long-term effects of cues
   indicating a threatening environment affecting the subsequent phenotype
   of the individual organism. Other examples consist of the long-term
   effects of variations in environment within a normal range, particularly
   in the individual's nutritional environment. In mammals the cues to
   developing offspring are often provided by the mother's plane of
   nutrition, her body composition or stress levels. This hypothetical
   effect in humans is thought to be important by some scientists and
   controversial by others. In resolving the conflict, distinctions should
   be drawn between PARs induced by normative variations in the
   developmental environment and the ill effects on development of extremes
   in environment such as a very poor or very rich nutritional environment.
   Tests to distinguish between different developmental processes impacting
   on adult characteristics are proposed. Many of the mechanisms underlying
   developmental plasticity involve molecular epigenetic processes, and
   their elucidation in the context of PARs and more widely has
   implications for the revision of classical evolutionary theory.}},

Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{Stress or negative mood often promotes energy intake and overeating.
   Since the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is
   found to mediate stress vulnerability as well as to influence energy
   intake, this gene may also influence the negative effects of stress
   exposure on overeating. Moreover, since stress proneness also reflects
   cognitive stress vulnerability as often defined by trait neuroticism
   this may additionally predispose for stress-induced overeating. In the
   present study it was investigated whether the 5-HTTLPR genotype
   interacted with neuroticism on changes in mood, appetite and energy
   intake following exposure to a real-life academic examination stressor.
   In a balanced-experimental design, homozygous S-allele and L-allele
   carriers (N= 94) with the lowest and highest neuroticism scores were
   selected from a large database of 5-HTTLPR genotyped students. Mood,
   appetite and energy intake were measured before and after a 2-hour
   academic examination and compared with a control day. Examination
   influenced appetite for particular sweet snacks differently depending on
   5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism. S/S compared with L/L subjects
   reported greater examination stress, and this was accompanied by a more
   profound post-stress increase in appetite for sweet snacks. Data also
   revealed a 5-HTTLPR genotype by trait neuroticism interaction on energy
   intake, regardless of examination. These results consolidate previous
   assumptions of 5-HTTLPR involvement in stress vulnerability and suggest
   5-HTTLPR and neuroticism may influence stress-induced overeating
   depending on the type of food available. These findings furthermore link
   previous findings of increased risk for weight gain in S/S-allele
   carriers, particularly with high scores on trait neuroticism, to
   increased energy intake. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eating slowly contributes to a lower risk of obesity, probably because

   strategy to reduce eating rate; however, insufficient data are available
   to demonstrate the relationship between such an eating behavior and

   conducted in 18- to 45-year-old normal-weight, overweight, and obese
   participants (n=45) who were recruited from the local community (Ames,

   asked to attend three test sessions to eat pizza for lunch until
   comfortably full by chewing each portion of food either 100\%, 150\%, or
   200\% of their baseline number of chews before swallowing. Two-way
   analysis of variance was used to test the effect of treatment and
   body-weight status, as well as their interactions on food intake, meal
   duration, eating rate, and appetite at meal termination. Appetite data
   during 60 minutes were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of

   baseline number of chews was reduced significantly, by 9.5\% and 14.8\%,
   respectively, compared with the 100\% session. Increasing the number of
   chews also prolonged meal duration and reduced eating rate. However,
   subjective appetite at meal termination or during the immediate
   postprandial period did not differ. These data indicate that increasing
   the number of chews before swallowing might be a behavioral strategy to
   reduce food intake and potentially aid body-weight management.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has greater efficacy for
   weight loss in obese patients than gastric banding (BAND) surgery. We
   hypothesise that this may result from different effects on food hedonics
   via physiological changes secondary to distinct gut anatomy
   manipulations.
   Design We used functional MRI, eating behaviour and hormonal phenotyping
   to compare body mass index (BMI)-matched unoperated controls and
   patients after RYGB and BAND surgery for obesity.
   Results Obese patients after RYGB had lower brain-hedonic responses to
   food than patients after BAND surgery. RYGB patients had lower
   activation than BAND patients in brain reward systems, particularly to
   high-calorie foods, including the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala,
   caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. This was associated
   with lower palatability and appeal of high-calorie foods and healthier
   eating behaviour, including less fat intake, in RYGB compared with BAND
   patients and/or BMI-matched unoperated controls. These differences were
   not explicable by differences in hunger or psychological traits between
   the surgical groups, but anorexigenic plasma gut hormones (GLP-1 and
   PYY), plasma bile acids and symptoms of dumping syndrome were increased
   in RYGB patients.
   Conclusions The identification of these differences in food hedonic
   responses as a result of altered gut anatomy/physiology provides a novel
   explanation for the more favourable long-term weight loss seen after
   RYGB than after BAND surgery, highlighting the importance of the
   gut-brain axis in the control of reward-based eating behaviour.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{351-361}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the foraging patterns of reef fishes is crucial for
   determining patterns of resource use and the sensitivity of species to
   environmental change. While changes in prey availability and
   interspecific competition have been linked to patterns of prey
   selection, body condition, and survival in coral reef fishes, rarely has
   the influence of abiotic environmental conditions on foraging been
   considered. We used underwater digital video to explore how prey
   availability and wave exposure influence the behavioural time budgets
   and prey selectivity of four species of obligate coral-feeding
   butterflyfishes. All four species displayed high selectivity towards
   live hard corals, both in terms of time invested and frequency of
   searching and feeding events. However, our novel analysis revealed that
   such selectivity was sensitive to wave exposure in some species, despite
   there being no significant differences in the availability of each prey
   category across exposures. In most cases, these obligate corallivores
   increased their selectivity towards their most favoured prey types at
   sites of high wave exposure. This suggests there are costs to foraging
   under different wave environments that can shape the foraging patterns
   of butterflyfishes in concert with other conditions such as prey
   availability, interspecific competition, and territoriality. Given that
   energy acquisition is crucial to the survival and fitness of fishes, we
   highlight how such environmental forcing of foraging behaviour may
   influence the ecological response of species to the ubiquitous and
   highly variable wave climates of shallow coral reefs.}},

Abstract = {{The transmission of insect-vectored diseases entails complex
   interactions among pathogens, hosts and vectors. Chemistry plays a key
   role in these interactions; yet, little work has addressed the chemical
   ecology of insect-vectored diseases, especially in plant pathosystems.
   Recently, we documented effects of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) on the
   phenotype of its host (Cucurbita pepo) that influence plant-aphid
   interactions and appear conducive to the non-persistent transmission of
   this virus. CMV reduces host-plant quality for aphids, causing rapid
   vector dispersal. Nevertheless, aphids are attracted to the elevated
   volatile emissions of CMV-infected plants. Here, we show that CMV
   infection (1) disrupts levels of carbohydrates and amino acids in leaf
   tissue (where aphids initially probe plants and acquire virions) and in
   the phloem (where long-term feeding occurs) in ways that reduce plant
   quality for aphids; (2) causes constitutive up-regulation of salicylic
   acid; (3) alters herbivore-induced jasmonic acid biosynthesis as well as
   the sensitivity of downstream defences to jasmonic acid; and (4)
   elevates ethylene emissions and free fatty acid precursors of volatiles.
   These findings are consistent with previously documented patterns of
   aphid performance and behaviour and provide a foundation for further
   exploration of the genetic mechanisms responsible for these effects and
   the evolutionary processes that shape them.
   This study explores the biochemical mechanisms underlying the influence
   of a widespread plant pathogen, the non-persistently transmitted
   Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), on aspects of host-plant phenotype that
   influence interactions with aphid vectors. This virus has previously
   been shown to enhance the attractiveness of plants for aphids (via
   volatile cues), while simultaneously reducing host plant palatability
   and quality (stimulating dispersal and virus transmission). Our current
   results demonstrate that CMV infection reduces host plant quality by
   altering ratios of carbohydrates to free amino acids in both
   non-vascular cells (those first sampled by aphids and from which virions
   are acquired) and in phloem sap, and that infection results in an
   increase in organic volatile precursors and herbivore defense signaling
   molecules both constitutively and in response to aphid damage. These
   changes are consistent with observed effects on host-plant phenotype and
   patterns of vector behavior, as well as with existing knowledge about
   the use of host plant resources by CMV during replication and systemic
   spread. Our results thus provide new insight into the transmission
   ecology of a multi-host plant pathogen of significant economic and
   ecological importance.}},

Abstract = {{Omnivory enables animals to fill more than one trophic niche, providing
   access to a wider variety of food resources with potentially higher
   nutrient value, particularly when resources become scarce. Animals can
   achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic
   foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches.
   The Neotropical bat Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766) is a common and
   widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and
   insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving
   objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require
   different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting
   hypothesis that G.soricina can approach both stationary and moving
   objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different
   trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism.
   Using DNA barcoding, we demonstrate that G.soricina eats beetles
   (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat-detecting ears.
   Laboratory observations show that G.soricina actively hunts for prey so
   insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture,
   individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw,
   thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and
   chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores.
   In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of
   G.soricina are of high frequency and low intensity, and G.soricina did
   not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model
   of detection distances shows that its low-intensity calls fail to
   trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing G.soricina to
   overcome auditory prey defences.
   Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist
   behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist
   methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional
   mechanisms of insect capture in G.soricina and highlight the importance
   of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in
   ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of predation risk effects predicts behavioral responses in
   prey when risk of predation is not homogenous in space and time. Prey
   species are often faced with a tradeoff between food and safety in
   situations where food availability and predation risk peak in the same
   habitat type. Determining the optimal strategy becomes more complex if
   predators with different hunting mode create contrasting landscapes of
   risk, but this has rarely been documented in vertebrates. Roe deer in
   southeastern Norway face predation risk from lynx, as well as hunting by
   humans. These two predators differ greatly in their hunting methods. The
   predation risk from lynx, an efficient stalk-and-ambush predator is
   expected to be higher in areas with dense understory vegetation, while
   predation risk from human hunters is expected to be higher where visual
   sight lines are longer. Based on field observations and airborne LiDAR
   data from 71 lynx predation sites, 53 human hunting sites, 132 locations
   from 15 GPS-marked roe deer, and 36 roe deer pellet locations from a
   regional survey, we investigated how predation risk was related to
   terrain attributes and vegetation classes/structure. As predicted, we
   found that increasing cover resulted in a contrasting lower predation
   risk from humans and higher predation risk from lynx. Greater terrain
   ruggedness increased the predation risk from both predators. Hence,
   multiple predators may create areas of contrasting risk as well as
   double risk in the same landscape. Our study highlights the complexity
   of predator-prey relationship in a multiple predator setting.
   Synthesis
   In this study of risk effects in a multi-predator context, LiDAR data
   were used to quantify cover in the habitat and relate it to
   vulnerability to predation in a boreal forest. We found that lynx and
   human hunters superimpose generally contrasting landscapes of fear on a
   common prey species, but also identified double-risk zones. Since the
   benefit of anti-predator responses depends on the combined risk from all
   predators, it is necessary to consider complete predator assemblages to
   understand the potential for and occurrence of risk effects across study
   systems.}},

   education in terms of healthy lifestyle is very well recognized
   nowadays. Lifestyle medicine offers important information about
   nutrition, physical activity, stress control and social support systems.
   Lifestyle can be treated as an indicator of social attitudes and of the
   ideologies that are functioning in the social space. In aboriginal
   tribes, eating behaviors had a strong religious imprint referring
   directly to obtain favors from the gods as health, wealth, healing and
   long life. Even if blatant promotion of a lifestyle can produce
   civilization, modelling behaviours, yet strongly promoting a lifestyle
   can become a subtle tool of manipulation and control. Following a
   healthy lifestyle, regardless of age. will have numerous health
   benefits, being proven that it reduces the risk of cardiovascular
   disease, decreases incidence of obesity and diabetes, the risk of
   malignancy, psychiatric disorders and cognitive dysfunction. The actual
   guidelines in preventive cardiovascular medicine provide the most
   important rules for physical training and healthy diet.}},

Title = {{Urban and colorful male house finches are less aggressive}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rapid human urbanization can have strong and varied impacts on the
   behavior and fitness of wild animals. The ``credit-card hypothesis{''}
   predicts that low predation and high food predictability in cities lead
   to the presence of many weak competitors in urban populations. However,
   no experimental studies to date have found support for this hypothesis.
   Here, we studied the relationship between urbanization and
   aggressiveness in males of a widespread North American songbird (the
   house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus) while taking into account the degree
   of sexual signal elaboration (plumage coloration), which is known to
   impact competitive outcomes. In paired laboratory experiments, we found
   that colorful urban males were less aggressive than drab urban males,
   whereas there was no significant difference in aggressiveness between
   colorful and drab rural males. Moreover, we found that colorful urban
   males were less aggressive than colorful rural males, whereas there was
   no significant difference in aggressiveness between drab urban and drab
   rural males. In 4-bird trials (i.e., trials with colorful and drab males
   from both urban and rural environments), we found that colorful urban
   males were consistently less aggressive than all others. Taken together,
   these results support the credit-card hypothesis and the idea that
   plumage color is an important predictor of social status in urban
   environments. Finally, in a model-presentation study, we found that
   urban males with lower body condition avoided drab male models. Urban
   settings, along with the social and foraging conditions they create, may
   exert novel selection pressures that shape the competitiveness and
   status signaling systems of animals.}},

Abstract = {{The decision to consume toxic prey is a trade-off between the benefits
   of obtaining nutrients and the costs of ingesting toxins. This trade-off
   is affected by current state: animals will consume more toxic prey if
   they are food deprived. However, whether the trade-off is affected by
   developmental history is currently unknown. We studied the decision to
   eat quinine-injected mealworms in adult starling siblings that had been
   exposed to either high or low levels of food competition as chicks, via
   a brood size manipulation. At the time of our experiments, the two
   groups of birds did not differ in size, body weight or current
   environment. Each bird was presented with the toxic prey while living on
   a high-quality diet and a low-quality diet. We found an effect of diet,
   with birds consuming more toxic prey while on the low-quality diet, and
   also of developmental history, with birds from the high-competition
   brood size treatment eating more toxic prey than their low-competition
   siblings. The effects of brood size treatment were not completely
   mediated by early growth, although we did find evidence that early
   growth affected toxic prey consumption independently of brood size
   treatment. We discuss our results in relation to adaptive developmental
   plasticity and the developmental origins of behavioural variation. (C)

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{161-169}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Birds present a variety of antipredator responses, including the use of
   acoustic signals that may be directed to other individuals or to the
   predator. We tested competing hypotheses regarding antipredator
   responses by analysing patterns of variation in the use of distress
   calls in campo flicker, Colaptes campestris campestris, nestlings. More
   specifically, we tested whether immune response and social context
   (presence or absence of other individuals of the social group) were
   associated with variation in use of acoustic signals in response to
   human handling. Individuals with higher immunocompetence used
   proportionally more harsh, low-pitched calls ('scream' notes) than
   individuals with lower immunocompetence, while the latter used mostly
   tonal, high-pitched calls ('week' notes); in both cases there was no
   influence of the social context on call type. Individuals responded to
   the social context by giving fewer scream notes and week notes in the
   presence of adults of the social group than when the adults were absent.
   Although playbacks are necessary to determine the function of the calls,
   our results indicate that campo flicker nestling antipredator calls
   could be used to attract other individuals of the group to help defend
   the nestling. Also, the use of proportionally more scream notes by
   healthier individuals suggests that these notes could act as an honest
   signal of the nestlings' physiological condition. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The objective of the current study was to determine if group-housing
   Holstein heifer calves in indoor pens with poor ventilation and drainage
   influences performance, health, leukocytes, and behavioral responses
   compared with individually housed calves. Ninety colostrum-fed calves (2
   +/- 1 d of age) were randomly assigned to 3 treatments: individually
   housed (Gl; n = 30 calves), 2 calves per pen (G2; n = 30 calves), or 3
   calves per pen (G3; n = 30 calves). The space allowance per calf was 2.5
   m(2) for all treatment groups. All calves were fed 747 and 1,010 g/d of
   dry matter of a 28\% CP and 20\% fat milk replacer during the first 2 wk
   and wk 3 to 6, respectively. Weaning was initiated on d 46 by removing
   the evening feeding, and calves were completely weaned when they
   consumed 800 g/d of dry matter calf starter for 2 consecutive days after
   d 54. Calves were randomly commingled at d 90 in groups of 5 calves per
   pen in outdoors pens with an attached hutch. Peripheral blood was
   collected during the neonatal (3, 10, 21 d), weaning (46, 48, 54 d), and
   commingling periods (90, 93, 98 d) and was analyzed for neutrophil
   oxidative burst capacity when cocultured with an Escherichia coli,
   neutrophil surface L-selectin protein concentration, and whole blood
   secretion of tumor necrosis factor-et when cocultured with
   lipopolysaccharide. Behavior of each calf was assessed using 2
   independent tests: an approach response to a human subject and the
   response of the calf when placed in an isolated cage. Calf starter
   intake was greater for G2 and G3 during wk 8 and 9, and also at wk 11
   for G3 compared with G1. No treatment x time interaction or treatment
   effect for average daily gain was observed. Additionally, no treatment x
   time or treatment effect was noted for any leukocyte or biochemical
   variable of biological significance throughout the entire study.
   Individually housed calves tended to have a reduced
   \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}incidence of respiratory disease during
   the first 90 d of life. No other treatment differences for the other
   health outcomes were observed. Group-housed calves also relied more on
   calf-to-calf interactions than calf-to-human interactions, as evident by
   their reduced approach of the human observer and more frequent movement
   when placed in an isolated pen. Group housing in an environment with
   poor ventilation and drainage may increase the risk of respiratory
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying alcohol

   assay, similar to a two-bottle choice consumption assay, as well as
   conditioned odor preference, where ethanol is used as the reinforcer,

   we have established a novel ethanol consumption preference assay, called
   FRAPPe, which allows for fast, high throughput measurement of

   show that naive flies do not prefer to consume ethanol, but various
   pre-exposures, such as ethanol vapor or voluntary ethanol consumption,
   induce ethanol preference. This ethanol-primed preference is long
   lasting and is not driven by calories contained in ethanol during the

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Current evidence suggests that many patients with self-reported
   non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) retain gastrointestinal symptoms
   on a gluten-free diet (GFD) but continue to restrict gluten as they
   report `feeling better'.
   Aim
   To investigate the notion that a major effect of gluten in those with
   NCGS is on mental state and not necessarily on gastrointestinal
   symptoms.
   Methods
   Twenty-two subjects (24-62years, five male) with irritable bowel
   syndrome who had coeliac disease excluded but were symptomatically
   controlled on a GFD, undertook a double-blind cross-over study.
   Participants randomly received one of three dietary challenges for
   3days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the
   next diet. Challenge gluten-free food was supplemented with gluten
   (16g/day), whey (16g/day) or not supplemented (placebo). End-points
   included mental state as assessed by the Spielberger State Trait
   Personality Inventory (STPI), cortisol secretion and gastrointestinal
   symptoms.
   Results
   Gluten ingestion was associated with higher overall STPI state
   depression scores compared to placebo {[}M=2.03, 95\% CI (0.55-3.51),
   P=0.010] but not whey {[}M=1.48, 95\% CI (-0.14 to 3.10), P=0.07]. No
   differences were found for other STPI state indices or for any STPI
   trait measures. No difference in cortisol secretion was identified
   between challenges. Gastrointestinal symptoms were induced similarly
   across all dietary challenges.
   Conclusions
   Short-term exposure to gluten specifically induced current feelings of
   depression with no effect on other indices or on emotional disposition.
   Gluten-specific induction of gastrointestinal symptoms was not
   identified. Such findings might explain why patients with non-coeliac
   gluten sensitivity feel better on a gluten-free diet despite the
   continuation of gastrointestinal symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify overeating phenotypes and
   their correlates in overweight and obese children. One hundred and
   seventeen treatment-seeking overweight and obese 8-12 year-old children
   and their parents completed the study. Children completed an eating in
   the absence of hunger (EAH) paradigm, the Eating Disorder Examination
   interview, and measurements of height and weight. Parents and children
   completed questionnaires that evaluated satiety responsiveness, food
   responsiveness, negative affect eating, external eating and eating in
   the absence of hunger. Latent profile analysis was used to identify
   heterogeneity in overeating phenotypes in the child participants. Latent
   classes were then compared on measures of demographics, obesity status
   and nutritional intake. Three latent classes of overweight and obese
   children were identified: High Satiety Responsive, High Food Responsive,
   and Moderate Satiety and Food Responsive. Results indicated that the
   High Food Responsive group had higher BMI and BMI-Z scores compared to
   the High Satiety Responsive group. No differences were found among
   classes in demographics or nutritional intake. This study identified
   three overeating phenotypes, supporting the heterogeneity of eating
   patterns associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking
   children. These finding suggest that these phenotypes can potentially be
   used to identify high risk groups, inform prevention and intervention
   targets, and develop specific treatments for these behavioral.

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of animal personality (i.e. consistent
   behavioural differences) is a major aim of evolutionary studies.
   Recent theoretical work suggests that major personality traits may
   contribute to evolutionary trade-offs. However, such associations have
   only been investigated in a few study systems, and even less so in free
   ranging animal populations.
   Eastern chipmunks exhibit consistent individual differences in
   exploration, ranging from slow to fast. Birth cohorts also experience
   dramatic differences in age at first breeding opportunity due to annual
   differences in beech mast. Individuals may breed for the first time at
   24, 33 or 50\% of their average life span, depending on year of birth.
   Here, we used data from a long-term survey on a wild population to
   investigate the relationship between reproductive life history and
   consistent individual differences in exploration. We determined whether
   predictable differences in age at first breeding opportunity among birth
   cohorts were associated with exploration differences and favoured
   individuals with different exploration.
   Birth cohorts with a predictably earlier age at first breeding
   opportunity were faster explorers on average. Slower explorers displayed
   their highest fecundity (females) or highest fertilization success
   (males) later in their life compared with faster explorers. Overall,
   slow explorers attained a higher lifetime reproductive success than fast
   explorers when given an opportunity to reproduce later in their life.
   Our results suggest that the timing of mating seasons, associated with
   fluctuating food abundance, may favour individual variation in
   exploration and maintain population variation through its effects on
   reproductive life history. Together, our result shed light on how
   fluctuation in ecological conditions may maintain personality
   differences and on the nature of the relationships between animal
   personality and life history.}},

Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{95-103}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{The performance of herbivorous insects depends on a balance of nutrient
   uptake and toxin avoidance. Whereas high concentrations of defensive
   plant metabolites impair both generalists and specialists, generalists
   are likely less adapted to particular hosts and thus more negatively
   affected by plant defense traits. Furthermore, resulting diet-dependent
   differences in the physiological state and the gained experience of an
   animal may shape its behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of
   life-long experience with leaves of different quality on the performance
   and various behavioral traits of the generalist leaf beetle Galeruca
   tanaceti. Rearing individuals continuously on three different diets
   {[}young leaves, old leaves, or leaves of different age of cabbage
   (Brassicaceae) in alternating order every other day], we found that
   relative growth rates (RGRs) of the larvae were higher when feeding on
   young leaves than when feeding on the other diets. Feeding on leaves of
   different age in alternating order reduced the performance of G.
   tanaceti, indicating costs involved in diet mixing. The experience
   gained by the respective food qualities shaped the preference behavior
   in adult beetles. Positive and negative feedbacks of animals reared on
   young or old leaves, respectively, led to a preference towards young
   leaves. In contrast, feedback was probably prevented for animals reared
   on alternating diet, which did not exhibit any preferences. Older adults
   did not show any diet-dependent differences in body mass due to
   physiological changes during adult development. A battery of behavioral
   tests with the older adults revealed that the behavior was consistent
   over context and partially over time but behaviors did not differ in
   dependence of the diet experience. We retrieved three personality
   dimensions for this species, namely boldness, activity, and exploration.
   The behavioral structure was very similar to earlier findings for
   another chrysomelid species, indicating a broader validity of the
   concept of personality dimensions in insects. Our results demonstrate
   the importance of both experience- and state-dependence when
   investigating behavioral phenotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights

   the size of individuals, adult zooplankton, and their offspring
   increased significantly following the provision of S. hantzschii, but
   not after the provision of C. vulgaris or of a combination of the two
   species. Offspring size was unaffected when C. vulgaris or a mixture of
   the two algal species was delivered, whereas providing only S.
   hantzschii increased the production of larger-sized offspring. Stable
   isotope analysis revealed significant assimilation of diatom-derived
   materials that was important for the growth of D. magna populations. Our
   results confirm the applicability of stable isotope approaches for
   clarifying the contribution of different food algae and elucidate the

Abstract = {{High fat, low carbohydrate diets have become popular, as short-term
   studies show that such diets are effective for reducing body weight, and
   lowering the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is
   growing evidence from both humans and other animals that diet affects
   behaviour and intake of fat has been linked, positively and negatively,
   with traits such as exploration, social interaction, anxiety and fear.
   Animal models with high translational value can help provide relevant
   and important information in elucidating potential effects of high fat,
   low carbohydrate diets on human behaviour. Twenty four young, male
   Gottingen minipigs were fed either a high fat/cholesterol, low
   carbohydrate diet or a low fat, high carbohydrate/sucrose diet in
   contrast to a standard low fat, high carbohydrate minipig diet.
   Spontaneous behaviour was observed through video recordings of home pens
   and test-related behaviours were recorded during tests involving
   animal-human contact and reaction towards a novel object. We showed that
   the minipigs fed a high fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet were less
   aggressive, showed more non-agonistic social contact and had fewer and
   less severe skin lesions and were less fearful of a novel object than
   minipigs fed low fat, high carbohydrate diets. These results found in a

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of ex situ conservation programmes as highlighted
   in the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan, there are few empirical
   studies that examine the influence of captive conditions on the fitness
   of amphibians, even for basic components of enclosure design such as
   cover provision. Maintaining the fitness of captive amphibian
   populations is essential to the success of ex situ conservation
   projects. Here we examined the impact of plant cover on measures of
   fitness and behaviour in captive red-eyed tree frogs (Agalychnis
   callidryas). We found significant effects of plant provision on body
   size, growth rates and cutaneous bacterial communities that together
   demonstrate a compelling fitness benefit from cover provision. We also
   demonstrate a strong behavioural preference for planted rather than
   non-planted areas. We also assessed the impact of plant provision on the
   abiotic environment in the enclosure as a potential driver of these
   behavioural and fitness effects. Together this data provides valuable
   information regarding enclosure design for a non-model amphibian species
   and has implications for amphibian populations maintained in captivity
   for conservation breeding programmes and research.}},

Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Obesity-induced changes in the metabolic and endocrine milieu elicit
   deficits in neuroplasticity, including increased risk for development of
   neuropsychiatric disorders such as depressive illness. We previously
   demonstrated that downregulation of hypothalamic insulin receptors
   (hypo-IRAS) elicits a phenotype that is consistent with features of the
   metabolic syndrome (MetS) and that rats with this phenotype exhibit
   deficits in neuronal plasticity, including depressive-like behaviors
   such as anhedonia. Since food restriction paradigms effectively inhibit
   obesity-induced neuroplasticity deficits, the aim of the current study
   was to determine whether food restriction could reverse obesity-induced
   anhedonia in hypo-IRAS rats. Compared to hypo-IRAS rats provided ad lib
   food access, food restriction paradigms that were initiated either prior
   to increases in body weight or following development of the MetS/obesity
   phenotype effectively restored sucrose intake in hypo-IRAS rats.
   Moreover, food restriction paradigms were able to prevent and reverse
   the changes in the endocrine/metabolic/inflammatory milieu observed in
   hypo-IRAS, such as increases in plasma leptin and triglyceride levels
   and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and
   C-reactive protein (CRP). Collectively, these results demonstrate that
   obesity-induced anhedonia is a reversible process and identify some
   potential mechanistic mediators that may be responsible for co-morbid
   depression in obesity. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of stream fishes exposed to different hydrodynamic, trophic,
   and physicochemical conditions may vary in their phenotypic traits in
   ways that influence local persistence. For example, gut morphology
   frequently varies with trophic position and food quality. As a result,
   one might expect gut morphology to differ between populations from
   watersheds with unique ecosystem characteristics, such as those
   occurring in urbanized streams. This study was an initial exploration to
   determine whether gut morphology of Campostoma oligolepis (Largescale
   Stoneroller) differed between an urbanized stream and a less urbanized
   stream in northwest Georgia, USA. Individuals were collected in May and
   June 2011 and dissected to quantify the gut length and gut quotient.
   With standard length as a covariate, gut length was shorter in the
   urbanized stream, and gut quotients were significantly lower. Gut
   lengths were also significantly longer in May than in June. One possible
   explanation for this difference is spatial and temporal variation in
   food sources associated with urbanization, although alternative

Abstract = {{The main impetus for `modern' intensive animal production occurred after
   the Second World War, when Western governments developed policies to
   increase the availability of cheap, safe food for their populations.
   Livestock benefit under intensive husbandry by protection from
   environmental extremes and predators, and better nutritional and health
   management. Nevertheless, there are costs to the animal, such as
   impaired social behaviour, limited choice of living environment or pen
   mates, poor environmental stimulation and behavioural restrictions. The
   rapid progress in genetic selection of production traits has also, in
   some cases, adversely affected welfare by creating anatomical and
   metabolic problems. Above all, the intensively housed animal is heavily
   reliant on the stockperson and, therefore, inadequate care and husbandry
   practices by the stockperson may be the largest welfare risk.
   In a future in which the food supply may be limited as the world's
   population grows and land availability shrinks, intensive animal
   production is likely to expand. At the same time, ethical considerations
   surrounding intensive farming practices may also become more prominent.
   Novel technologies provide the opportunity to enhance both the
   productivity and welfare of intensively kept animals. Developing
   countries are also establishing more intensive commercial systems to
   meet their growing need for animal protein. Intensive livestock
   production in such countries has the potential for major expansion,
   particularly if such developments address the key constraints of poor
   welfare, inadequate nutrition, poor reproduction, poor housing, and high
   mortality often seen with traditional systems, and if farmer access to
   emerging market opportunities is improved. However, as shown by previous
   experience, inadequate regulation and staff who lack the appropriate
   training to care for the welfare of intensively housed livestock can be
   major challenges to overcome.}},

Abstract = {{Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a
   deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which metabolizes
   phenylalanine (phe) to tyrosine. A low-phe diet plus amino acid (AA)
   formula is necessary to prevent cognitive impairment; glycomacropeptide
   (GMP) contains minimal phe and provides a palatable alternative to the
   AA formula. Our objective was to assess neurotransmitter concentrations
   in the brain and the behavioral phenotype of PKU mice (Pah(enu2) on the
   C57BI/6 background) and how this is affected by low-phe protein sources.
   Wild type (WT) and PKU mice, both male and female, were fed high-phe
   casein, low-phe AA, or low-phe GMP diets between 3 and 18 weeks of age.
   Behavioral phenotype was assessed using the open field and marble
   burying tests, and brain neurotransmitter concentrations were measured
   using HPLC with electrochemical detection system. Data were analyzed by
   3-way ANOVA with genotype, sex, and diet as the main treatment effects.
   Brain mass and the concentrations of catecholamines and serotonin were
   reduced in PKU mice compared to WT mice; the low-phe AA and GMP diets
   improved these parameters in PKU mice. Relative brain mass was increased
   in female PKU mice fed the GMP diet compared to the AA diet. PKU mice
   exhibited hyperactivity and impaired vertical exploration compared to
   their WT littermates during the open field test. Regardless of genotype
   or diet, female mice demonstrated increased vertical activity time and
   increased total ambulatory and horizontal activity counts compared with
   male mice. PKU mice fed the high-phe casein diet buried significantly
   fewer marbles than WT control mice fed casein; this was normalized in
   PKU mice fed the low-phe AA and GMP diets. In summary, C57BI/6-Pah(enu2)
   mice showed an impaired behavioral phenotype and reduced brain
   neurotransmitter concentrations that were improved by the low-phe AA or
   GMP diets. These data support lifelong adherence to a low-phe diet for
   PKU. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Tadpoles show considerable behavioral plasticity. When population
   densities become high, tadpoles often become cannibalistic, likely in
   response to intense competition. Conspecific tissues are potentially an
   ideal diet by composition and should greatly improve growth and
   development. However, the potential release of alarm cues from the
   tissues of injured conspecifics may act to deter potential cannibals
   from feeding. We conducted multiple feeding experiments to test the
   relative effects that a diet of conspecifics has on tadpole growth and
   development. Results indicate that while conspecific tissues represent a
   better alternative to starvation and provide some benefits over
   low-protein diets, such a diet can have detrimental effects to tadpole
   growth and/or development relative to diets of similar protein content.
   Additionally, tadpoles raised individually appear to avoid consuming
   conspecific tissues and may continue to do so until they suffer from the
   effects of starvation. However, tadpoles readily fed upon conspecific
   tissues immediately when raised with competitors. These results suggest
   that cannibalism may occur as a result of competition rather than the
   specific quality of available diets, unless such diets lead to
   starvation.}},

Abstract = {{For long-lived organisms, the fitness value of survival is greater than

   similarly: Females who lost large amounts of winter body mass gained
   more body mass the coming summer compared with females losing less mass
   during winter. Additionally, females experienced a cost of reproduction:
   On average, barren females gained more body mass than lactating females.
   Winter body mass development positively affected both the females'

Pages = {{91-100}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Forming foraging groups may help to improve protection from predators,
   foraging efficiency and exchange of information, but to benefit from
   these advantages, animals need to maintain group cohesion. Several
   studies have investigated how social status or behavioural and
   physiological traits promote leadership and followership in various
   species, but the potential role of ecological factors in modulating
   social cohesion of foraging groups has received less attention. We used
   social network analysis to investigate how a temporary shortage of food
   affects within-group following behaviour in house sparrow, Passer
   domesticus, flocks and which individual characteristics influence birds'
   positions in the following networks. To test this, we observed nine
   captive house sparrow flocks, composed of 12 individuals each, in three
   consecutive sessions, in which the food availability was altered. We
   found that food reduction did not modify the following network structure
   and that individuals had consistent positions within the flocks, as
   males and adults were followed more often than females and juveniles,
   respectively. However, short-term food reduction affected individuals'
   following behaviour according to their age: adults increased their
   following rates during food scarcity, whereas the opposite trend was
   found in juveniles. This pattern also remained after the
   re-establishment of initial conditions, suggesting that ecological
   changes can also induce individual-level lasting effects. Our study
   provides empirical evidence that food reduction does not affect the
   global social structure of house sparrow flocks but nevertheless
   individuals respond differently to ecological changes according to their
   age. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {{Antipredator behavioural compensation of proactive personality trait in

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{297-303}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many animals show behavioural syndromes (i.e. suites of correlated
   behaviours across multiple situations). These behavioural correlations,
   however, imply limitations in the behavioural plasticity of individuals
   when facing the trade-off between predation risk and starvation risk.
   Some models suggest that proactive animals prioritize the reduction of
   starvation risk, while reactive animals do the opposite. Therefore, fast
   explorers that are also bold (i.e. proactive) are assumed to pay a
   predation cost associated with their behavioural trait. However, it has
   recently been suggested that proactive individuals may be able to
   compensate for their higher risk of predation by adopting some
   antipredator behaviours. In this study we tested these two alternative
   hypotheses with wild wintering Eurasian siskins, Carduelis spinus,
   foraging at artificial feeders. Male siskins have a melanin-based black
   bib that has been found to be correlated with exploratory behaviour,
   aggressiveness and dominance, and therefore is a signal of pro-activity.
   We found that male siskins with large black bibs uttered more distress
   calls upon capture and displayed a vigilance strategy that improved
   predator detection. Moreover, this vigilance strategy did not reduce
   food intake rate. These results show that proactive individuals are not
   reckless, but instead compensate for their personality trait with
   stronger antipredator behaviours, and thus, do not necessarily have to
   pay a predation cost. Our results support the view of a positive
   relationship between eumelanism, proactive personality and the display
   of antipredator behaviours. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence for an
   association between the Big Five dimensions of personality, dietary
   intake, and compliance to dietary recommendations. Poor diet is a known
   risk factor for overweight and obesity and associated chronic lifestyle

   dietary choices. Findings from cross-sectional surveys from different
   countries and cultures show a positive association between Openness and
   consumption of fruits and vegetables and between Conscientiousness and
   healthy eating. Although no evidence has been found that personality
   dimensions are associated with adherence to dietary recommendations over
   time, Conscientiousness is associated with a number of prosocial and
   health-promoting behaviors that include avoiding alcohol-related harm,
   binge-drinking, and smoking, and adherence to medication regimens. With
   emerging evidence of an association between higher Conscientiousness and
   lower obesity risk, the hypothesis that higher Conscientiousness may
   predict adoption of healthy dietary and other lifestyle recommendations

Abstract = {{1. Maternal effects are increasingly recognized to impact upon
   infectious diseases. Stressful environmental conditions that coincide
   with high infection prevalence are potential cues for adaptive maternal
   effects on offspring resistance to infection.
   2. We studied how maternal temperature (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and
   25 degrees C), as well as maternal food availability (high and low food)
   influenced the ability of the crustacean, Daphnia magna, to resist its
   bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa.
   3. Mothers held at a higher temperature and mothers fed a restricted
   diet produced offspring that were more resistant to P. ramosa infection.
   4. Maternal temperature also influenced the progression of disease in
   infected offspring. Parasite spore production and host reproduction were
   affected by maternal temperature, but these effects differed in the two
   genotypes used.
   5. As Daphnia populations experience regular summer epidemics of P.
   ramosa, temperature may be an environmental signal of infection risk.
   Thus, the enhanced resistance we observed under stressful food and
   temperature is conceivably an adaptation to looming epidemics.
   6. Thus, this study identifies novel ways in which the maternal
   environment impacts upon disease resistance and indicates how phenotypic
   plasticity might both alter co-evolution and mitigate epidemics driven

Abstract = {{1. Original sperm competition theory assumed that males trade
   expenditure on searching for mates for expenditure on the ejaculate and
   predicted that males should increase their expenditure on the ejaculate
   in response to increased risk of competition. A recent extension of this
   theory has modelled pre-copulatory expenditure in terms of direct
   contest competition and predicts that when the gains from marginal
   investment in weaponry are large, males might be expected to allocate
   resources to armaments even at the expense of the ejaculate.
   2. Here, we examine socially cued plasticity in allocation to pre- (body
   condition) and postcopulatory (testes mass) traits in a male dimorphic
   beetle, Onthophagus taurus, where major males fight for access to
   females and minor males obtain reproductive success via sperm
   competition. Both male morphs were either reared in social isolation or
   exposed to rivals during the period of sexual maturation following adult
   emergence.
   3. Testes mass was found to be insensitive to social cues of future
   mating competition for both major and minor males. Major males allocated
   more to body condition when exposed to rivals, a response expected for a
   species in which the outcome of dyadic contests strongly affects male
   reproductive success. In contrast, minor male allocation to condition
   was insensitive to social cues.
   4. Our data illustrate how socially cued plasticity in pre- and
   post-copulatory traits can depend on the relative importance of these
   episodes of selection for individual male fitness. In O. taurus dung
   beetles, males strategically adjusted the amount of resources they
   allocated to winning pre-copulatory contests over access to females.
   Strategic allocation to pre-copulatory contest competition did not come
   at a cost to male investment in sperm competition, suggesting that males
   may trade investment into contest competition against some other
   life-history trait, such as longevity. The lack of plasticity in testes
   size suggests that selection from sperm competition may be a relatively
   constant feature of this species mating system.}},

Abstract = {{Animals generally live in multisensory worlds; however, our
   understanding of multisensory perception is rather limited, despite its
   relevance for explaining the mechanisms behind social interactions, such
   as collective detection while foraging in groups. We tested how
   multisensory stimuli affected the antipredator behavior of dark-eyed
   juncos (Junco hyemalis) using alarm calls as an auditory signal and
   flushing behavior as a visual cue. We varied the degree of risk within
   the group by manipulating the number of group mates alarm calling and/or

   were redundant stimuli and predicted that they could generate one of
   three types of responses (enhancement, equivalence, or antagonism)

   alarm of live juncos increased when at least one robot flushed. However,
   the time it took the live individuals to react to the robots' behavior
   increased, rather than decreased, with at least one alarm call. This
   could be the result of an orienting response or sensory overload, as
   live juncos increased scanning behavior after being exposed solely to
   alarm calls. Contrary to some theoretical assumptions, alarm calling and
   flushing behavior elicited independent unimodal responses, suggesting
   that they are non-redundant stimuli and that together they could reduce
   the occurrence of false alarms and facilitate flock cohesion.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity is now ranked fifth as a global risk
   for the cause of death. Urban lifestyle is fueled by excessive food
   intake and lack of activity in overweight and obese children. The
   assessment of the children's Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the
   indicators to assess the nutritional status of children. One strategy
   that can be used is the transtheoretical model (TTM) approach which is
   behavior change that helps children and parents in making more effective
   decisions to reduce health-risk behaviors among children so that the
   children's BMI can decrease. This study aims to identify the differences
   between children's BMI before and after the TTM approach.
   METHODS: This research was conducted in the district area of Tamalanrea
   and Biringkanaya, Makassar. The design used is the Quasy Experiment
   namely pre- and post-test with control group design. Research subjects
   were overweight or obese children in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of
   elementary school. The samples in the treatment group consisted of 31
   participants, while the control group consisted of 33 participants which
   were selected using purposive sampling. Intervention research was
   conducted during a six month period by providing guide books on healthy
   lifestyle, visiting the families every month using questionnaires, and
   measurements of children's height, weight and BMI using WHO's AntrhoPlus
   software year 2007.
   RESULTS: Post-pretest results showed the average value of the treatment
   group's BMI was -1,48 and the control group was 1,35. This means that
   the treatment group experienced a decrease in BMI after the application
   of TTM. The Mann Whitney test results indicate that there is a
   difference in the BMI pre-post intervention with the value of p=0.00 (>
   0.05).
   CONCLUSION: The overweight and obese children's BMI was inluenced by TTM
   approach.}},

Title = {{Dynamic modification of hoarding in response to hoard size manipulation}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{8-12}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Food hoarding is an evolutionary adaptation whereby animals store food
   for later consumption when food is limited or when predation risk while
   foraging is high. It also occurs as part of normal appetitive behavior
   by humans and non-human animals when they are hungry. Contrary to
   popular belief, humans do not overeat after food restriction/fasting,
   rather they increase food hoarding, as do hamster species, but not in
   laboratory rats or mice. Thus, this aspect of human appetitive behavior
   is better modeled by hamsters than laboratory rats and mice. Here we
   tested whether male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) modify their
   daily food hoard size under ad libitum-feeding and after food
   deprivation when we artificially increased or removed their food hoard.
   When the food hoard was completely removed, hamsters hoarded more food
   the next day than did animals where the hoard was surreptitiously
   increased. Hamsters that had alternating daily hoard increases/decreases
   rapidly adjusted their food hoarding inversely proportional to food
   hoard size. Similarly, after 48 h of food deprivation, a stimulus that
   initiates high levels of food hoarding upon refeeding in this species,
   hamsters with artificially increased food hoard size hoarded
   significantly less than did hamsters where we left the hoard unaltered
   additionally suggesting that food hoard size directly affects food
   hoarding. Collectively, as we previously found when the caloric value of
   the food offered was increased or decreased, food hoard size is in some
   sense `regulated' and not simply a reflexive response triggered by
   inter-meal hunger or food deprivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Scatter hoarders must allocate time to assess items for caching, and to
   carry and bury each cache. Such decisions should be driven by economic
   variables, such as the value of the individual food items, the scarcity
   of these items, competition for food items and risk of pilferage by
   conspecifics. The fox squirrel, an obligate scatter-hoarder, assesses
   cacheable food items using two overt movements, head flicks and paw
   manipulations. These behaviors allow an examination of squirrel decision
   processes when storing food for winter survival. We measured wild
   squirrels' time allocations and frequencies of assessment and investment
   behaviors during periods of food scarcity (summer) and abundance (fall),
   giving the squirrels a series of 15 items (alternating five hazelnuts
   and five peanuts). Assessment and investment per cache increased when
   resource value was higher (hazelnuts) or resources were scarcer
   (summer), but decreased as scarcity declined (end of sessions). This is
   the first study to show that assessment behaviors change in response to
   factors that indicate daily and seasonal resource abundance, and that
   these factors may interact in complex ways to affect food storing
   decisions. Food-storing tree squirrels may be a useful and important

Abstract = {{A wide variety of organisms show morphologically plastic responses to
   environmental stressors but in general these changes are not reversible.
   Though less common, reversible morphological structures are shown by a
   range of species in response to changes in predators, competitors or
   food. Theoretical analysis indicates that reversible plasticity
   increases fitness if organisms are long-lived relative to the frequency
   of changes in the stressor and morphological changes are rapid. Many sea
   urchin species show differences in the sizes of jaws (demi-pyramids) of
   the feeding apparatus, Aristotle's lantern, relative to overall body
   size, and these differences have been correlated with available food.
   The question addressed here is whether reversible changes of relative
   jaw size occur in the field as available food changes with season.
   Monthly samples of the North American Pacific coast sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were collected from Gregory Point on the
   Oregon (USA) coast and showed an annual cycle of relative jaw size
   together with a linear trend from 2007 to 2009. Strongylocentrotus

Abstract = {{Background: Although the association between depression and body
   composition has been widely discussed, the effects of depression on lean
   body mass (LBM) are unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the
   association of depression with LBM.
   Methods: The study included 2406 participants aged 18-69 years. The sex
   and body mass index (BMI) stratified analysis of covariance was
   performed to compare total LBM and percentage LBM (\%LBM) in subjects
   with different depression score levels. Multiple linear regression
   analysis was conducted to estimate the association between depression
   score and serum albumin level.
   Results: An analysis of covariance stratified by sex showed that
   participants with moderate-to-severe depression had significantly
   decreased total LBM and total and regional \%LBM in men, except for
   total LBM and percentage gynoid LBM, which was observed in women. In the
   BMI stratified analysis of covariance, depression was significantly
   associated with decreased total and regional \%LBM and with increased
   total and regional percentage fat body mass. In people with BMI >= 25
   kg/m(2), the associations between depression or depressive syndrome and
   LBM, and total and regional \%LBM are stronger compared to those with
   BMI <25 kg/m(2). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that
   depression score was significantly negatively associated with serum
   albumin level.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study based on a general

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural flexibility is thought to be a major factor in evolution. It
   may facilitate the discovery and exploitation of new resources, which in
   turn may expose populations to novel selective forces and facilitate
   adaptive radiation. Darwin's finches are a textbook example of adaptive
   radiation. They are fast learners and show a range of unusual foraging
   techniques, probably as a result of their flexibility. In this study we
   aimed to test whether variability of the environment is correlated with
   flexibility. We compared woodpecker finches from a dry area (hereafter,
   Arid Zone), where food availability is variable, with individuals from a
   cloud forest (hereafter, Scalesia zone) where food abundance is stable.
   As parameters for flexibility, we measured neophilia and neophobia,
   which are two aspects of reaction to novelty, reversal learning and
   problem-solving. We found no differences in performance on a
   problem-solving task but, in line with our prediction, individuals from
   the Arid Zone were significantly faster reversal learners and more
   neophilic than their conspecifics from the Scalesia zone. The latter
   result supports the notion that environmental variability drives
   flexibility. In contrast to our prediction, Arid Zone birds were even
   more neophobic than birds from the Scalesia Zone. The latter result
   could be the consequence of differences in predation pressure between
   the two vegetation zones.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{409-414}},

Abstract = {{Calling a mate can be dangerous for insects, but that does not stop
   attractive wax moths from singing even when they hear a bat call.
   Theoretically, unattractive males should take higher risks because they
   have less to lose, instead they behave more cautiously. A reason for
   this difference in behavior could be that attractive moths exhaust
   themselves quickly and try to find a mate while they still can.
   Unattractive moths can afford to wait.Individuals often have to balance
   the costs of risky behavior against the potential benefits they may gain
   from it. This trade-off is especially obvious in the interplay between
   natural and sexual selection because traits for mate attraction may
   attract predators as well. In the lesser wax moth Achroia grisella,
   ultrasonic sexual signaling comes with such a risk because calling for
   mates also attracts predatory bats. Attractive males should behave more
   cautiously than unattractive males under such circumstances, as they can
   expect more future mating opportunities and therefore have more to lose
   (the so-called asset protection principle). Contrary to these
   predictions, we found that pulse pair rate and peak amplitude, 2 song
   components attractive to females, correlated negatively with the
   duration of a silence response which is displayed when courtship song is
   experimentally overlayed with the search signal of a predator, the
   greater horseshoe bat. More attractive males thus recommence singing
   sooner than less attractive males. Although this is not in line with the
   asset protection principle, we discuss 3 different ways in which these
   distinct behavioral differences might be explained: 1) attractive males
   are in better condition and thus can more easily evade predators, 2)
   attractive signals are costly in terms of reduced life expectancy, and
   3) risk-taking may in itself be a sexually selected trait and as such
   act as an honest signal of male quality.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{156-164}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Human gambling often involves the choice of a low probability but high
   valued outcome over a high probability (certain) low valued outcome (not
   gambling) that is economically more optimal. We have developed an analog
   of gambling in which pigeons prefer a suboptimal alternative that
   infrequently provides a signal for a high probability (or high
   magnitude) of reinforcement over an optimal alternative that always
   provides a signal for a lower probability (or lower magnitude) of
   reinforcement. We have identified two mechanisms that may be responsible
   for this suboptimal behavior. First, the effect of nonreinforcement
   results in considerably less inhibition of choice than ideally it
   should. Second, the frequency of the occurrence of the signal for a high
   probability or high magnitude of reinforcement is less important than
   ideally it should. Also analogous to human gambling is the finding that
   pigeons that are normally food restricted choose suboptimally, whereas
   those that are minimally food restricted choose optimally. In addition,
   pigeons that are singly housed choose suboptimally, whereas those that
   are exposed to a more enriched environment choose less suboptimally. We
   believe that these findings have implications for the understanding and
   treatment of problem gambling behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Early developmental stress can have long-term physiological and
   behavioral effects on an animal. Developmental stress and early
   corticosterone (Cort) exposure affect song quality in many songbirds.
   Early housing condition can act as a stressor and affect the growth of
   nestlings and adult song, and improvements in housing condition can
   reverse adverse effects of early stress exposure in rodents. However,
   little is known about this effect in songbirds. Therefore, we took a
   novel approach to investigate if housing condition can modify the
   effects of early Cort exposure on adult song in male zebra finches. We
   manipulated early housing conditions to include breeding in large
   communal flight cages (FC; standard housing condition; with mixed-sex
   and mix-aged birds) versus individual breeding cages (IBC, one
   male-female pair with small, IBC-S, or large clutches, IBC-L) in
   post-hatch Cort treated male birds. We found that Cort treated birds
   from IBC-S have higher overall song learning scores (between tutor and
   pupil) than from FC but there is no difference between these groups in
   the No-Cort treated birds. When examining the effects of Cort within
   each housing condition, overall song learning scores decreased in Cort
   treated birds from flight cages but increased in birds from IBC-S
   compared to controls. Likewise, the total number of syllables and
   syllable types increased significantly in Cort treated birds from IBC-S,
   but decreased in FC-reared birds though this effect was not
   statistically significant. These findings suggest that the effects of
   early Cort treatment on learned features of song depend on housing
   condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of behavioral types in situ and the drivers of
   persistence are central to predicting the ecological effects of
   intraspecific behavioral variation. We surveyed individual refuge use of
   mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a
   trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and
   presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released
   these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the
   repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat,
   and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on
   average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited
   some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how
   tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation
   threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than
   large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use
   was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size,
   crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our
   results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey
   organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat
   should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a
   severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately
   important influences on behavior (e. g., hunger) and that (2) individual
   behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge
   use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be

Abstract = {{Mammalian embryos have evolved to adjust their organ and tissue
   development in response to an atypical environment. This adaptation,
   called phenotypic plasticity, allows the organism to thrive in the
   anticipated environment in which the fetus will emerge. Barker and
   colleagues proposed that if the environment in which the fetus emerges
   differs from that in which it develops, phenotypic plasticity may
   provide an underlying mechanism for disease. Epidemiological studies
   have shown that humans born small- or large-for-gestational-age, have a
   higher likelihood of developing obesity as adults. The amount and
   quality of food that the mother consumes during gestation influences
   birth weight, and therefore susceptibility of progeny to disease in
   later life. Studies in experimental animals support these observations,
   and find that obesity occurs as a result of maternal
   nutrient-restriction during gestation, followed by rapid compensatory
   growth associated with ad libitum food consumption. Therefore, obesity
   associated with maternal nutritional restriction has a developmental
   origin. Based on this phenomenon, one might predict that gestational
   exposure to a westernized diet would protect against future obesity in
   offspring. However, evidence from experimental models indicates that
   like maternal dietary restriction, maternal consumption of a westernized
   diet during gestation and lactation interacts with an adult obesogenic
   diet to induce further obesity. Mechanistically, restriction of
   nutrients or consumption of a high fat diet during gestation may promote
   obesity in progeny by altering hypothalamic neuropeptide production and
   thereby increasing hyperphagia in offspring. In addition to changes in
   food intake these animals may also direct energy from muscle toward
   storage in adipose tissue. Surprisingly, generational inheritance
   studies in rodents have further indicated that effects on body length,
   body weight, and glucose tolerance appear to be propagated to subsequent
   generations. Together, the findings discussed herein highlight the
   concept that maternal nutrition contributes to a legacy of obesity.
   Thus, ensuring adequate supplies of a complete and balanced diet during
   and after pregnancy should be a priority for public health worldwide.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{93-97}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Prey animals often need to learn the identity of unknown predators, and
   not surprisingly, nearby conspecifics provide a rich source of
   information about both the identity and risk level posed by unknown
   predators. Individuals that learn from watching conspecifics that show a
   weak response to a predator often learn that the predator is a mild
   threat, while those that observe conspecifics that show a strong
   response to the predator, learn that the predator is a high-level
   threat. This means that any factor that influences the intensity of the
   antipredator response of the tutor can potentially influence the
   efficacy of information transfer to the observer. We know that food
   resources influence the activity levels of prey, making them more or
   less conspicuous to nearby conspecifics. We also know that prey often
   ignore risk if they have restricted access to food resources. This means
   that food resources have the potential to dramatically change social
   learning dynamics. In the present study, we found that tadpoles fed
   restricted diets had much higher activity levels than those fed ad
   libitum food resources. Their high activity made them more conspicuous
   to nearby conspecifics, causing them to be much more efficient as
   tutors. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of social learning, as
   information transfer is likely to change considerably from place to
   place and year to year as resources change through space and time. (C)

   reproduce, and depends on many intrinsic and environmental factors.
   There is increasing evidence that man-made (anthropogenic) factors can
   affect the behaviour of a wide range of taxa. However, few experimental
   studies have investigated how foraging behaviour is affected by exposure
   to increased noise levels, an issue of growing global concern. In our
   laboratory study, we examined how exposure to playback of noise
   originally recorded from ships, a prevalent source of human-generated
   underwater noise, affects the feeding behaviour of two sympatric fish
   species: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and the
   European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus. Both species consumed significantly
   fewer live Daphnia magna, and showed startle responses significantly
   more often during playback of additional noise than during control
   conditions. However, whereas minnows showed a qualitative shift in
   activity away from foraging behaviour (greater inactivity, more social
   behaviour) under increased noise conditions, consistent with a classic
   stress-or fear-related defence cascade, sticklebacks maintained foraging
   effort but made more mistakes, which may result from an impact of noise
   on cognition. These findings indicate that additional noise in the
   environment can lead to reduced food consumption, but that the effects
   of elevated noise are species specific. It remains to be tested whether
   these interspecific differences translate into different ultimate
   impacts, but differential disruptions to foraging may have potential
   consequences for relative individual fitness and community structure.

Title = {{Temperature and food availability affect risk assessment in an ectotherm}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{199-204}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Risk assessment in ectotherms is strongly affected by an organism's
   energy expenditure and acquisition because these will alter the
   motivation to feed, which is balanced against antipredator behaviours.
   Temperature and food availability are known to affect the physiological
   condition of ectotherms, but how interactions between these variables
   may influence predator-prey dynamics is still poorly understood. This
   study examined the interactive effects of food availability and
   temperature on the trade-offs between predator avoidance behaviour and
   foraging in juveniles of a marine damselfish, Pomacentrus chrysurus.
   Predator avoidance behaviour was tested by exposing fish to chemical
   alarm cues obtained from skin extract of conspecifics. When detected,
   these cues elicit an antipredator response in fish, typically
   characterized by decreased foraging. Fish maintained under high food
   ration displayed distinct antipredator responses to chemical alarm cues,
   regardless of temperature. However, fish maintained in conditions of low
   food ration and 3 degrees C above ambient temperature did not display an
   antipredator response when exposed to chemical alarm cues, whereas those
   in ambient temperature did. These results suggest that individuals in
   low physiological condition because of limited food availability are
   more susceptible to increased temperature and may therefore take greater
   risks under predation threats to satisfy their energetic requirements.

Abstract = {{Organisms experience competing selective pressures, which can obscure
   the mechanisms driving evolution. Daphnia ambigua is found in lakes
   where a predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) either does
   (anadromous) or does not (landlocked) migrate between marine and
   freshwater. We previously reported an association between alewife
   variation and life history evolution in Daphnia. However, differences in
   alewife migration indirectly influence phytoplankton composition for
   Daphnia. In `anadromous lakes', Daphnia are present in the spring and
   experience abundant high-quality green algae. Intense predation by
   young-of-the-year anadromous alewife quickly eliminates these Daphnia
   populations by early summer. Daphnia from `landlocked lakes' and lakes
   without alewife ('no alewife lakes') are present during the spring and
   summer and are more likely to experience high concentrations of
   sub-optimal cyanobacteria during the summer. To explore links between
   predation, resources, and prey evolution, we reared third-generation
   laboratory-born Daphnia from all lake types on increasing cyanobacteria
   concentrations. We observed several significant `lake type x resource'
   interactions whereby the differences among lake types depended upon
   cyanobacteria concentrations. Daphnia from anadromous lakes developed
   faster, were larger at maturation, produced more offspring, and had
   higher intrinsic rates of increase in the absence of cyanobacteria. Such
   trends disappeared or reversed as cyanobacteria concentration was
   increased because Daphnia from anadromous lakes were more strongly
   influenced by the presence of cyanobacteria. Our results argue that
   alewife migration and phytoplankton composition both play a role in
   Daphnia evolution.}},

Pages = {{238-248}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities (e.g. consistent across-context behavioural
   differences between individuals) can lead to differences in mate choice.
   However, evidence for this link remains limited. Pre-mating sexual
   cannibalism can be a behavioural syndrome (i.e. a suboptimal
   personality) in which adaptive female aggression towards heterospecific
   prey spills over on non-adaptive aggression towards courting males,
   independently of the female mating or feeding status (i.e. the
   aggressive spillover hypothesis', ASH). On the other hand, sexual
   cannibalism can also be a form of mate choice by which females
   selectively kill or mate with males depending on the male phenotype. We
   introduce the hypothesis that the most aggressive females in the
   population will not only attack males more frequently, but will be less
   likely to impose sexual selection on males through sexual cannibalism.
   Assuming that in a field common garden experiment in which females were
   fed ad libitum the rate of weight gain by a female may reflect her
   voracity or aggressiveness, we show that in the cannibalistic burrowing
   wolf spider Lycosa hispanica (formerly L.tarantula), voracity towards
   heterospecific prey predicts a female's tendency towards sexual
   cannibalism. Unmated females with higher weight gains were more
   cannibalistic and attacked males regardless of the male phenotype. On
   the other hand, females that were less voracious tended to be less
   cannibalistic, and when they did kill a male, they were selective,
   killing males in poorer condition and mating with those in better
   condition. Our results demonstrate that females with different
   phenotypes (growth rates) differently imposed selection on male
   condition, tentatively supporting the hypothesis that female aggression
   levels can spill over on sexual selection through sexual cannibalism.}},

   Male Wistar rats were divided into two groups according to their
   mothers' diets during gestation and lactation: control (NP, 17\% of
   casein) and low-protein (LP, 8\% of casein) groups. Direct measurements
   of ABP, respiratory frequency (RF), tidal volume (V-T) and ventilation
   (VE), as well as hypercapnia (7\% CO2) and hypoxia (7\% O-2) evoked
   respiratory responses were recorded from the awake male offspring at the
   30th and 90th days of life. Blood samples were collected for the
   analyses of protein, creatinine and urea concentrations. The LP
   offspring had impaired body weight and length throughout the experiment.
   At 30d of age, the LP rats showed a reduction in the concentrations of
   total serum protein (approximately 24\%). ABP in the LP rats was similar
   to that in the NP rats at 30d of age, but it was 20\% higher at 90d of

   RF (approximately 34\%) and VE (approximately 34\%) at 30d of age, which
   was associated with increased ventilatory responses to hypercapnia
   (approximately 21\% in VE) and hypoxia (approximately 82\% in VE). At
   90d of age, the VE values and CO2/O-2 chemosensitivity of the LP rats
   were restored to the control range, but the RF values remained elevated.
   The present data show that a perinatal LP diet alters respiratory rhythm

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{13-19}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the trade-off between time for searching for and exploiting
   resources, choosing a profitable food resource is key for an animal's
   survival and reproductive success. Although the optimal diet model (ODM)
   from optimal foraging theory (OFT) has demonstrated this point
   successfully by modelling the global maximization of energy intake rate
   for foraging, the behavioural mechanisms by which animals achieve
   optimization, especially when facing a novel environment, have yet to be
   understood. Here we propose a recent experience-driven (RED)
   decision-making rule of foraging that relies only on short-term memory
   of recent feeding experience and hunger aversion. This contrasts with
   the ODM, which assumes both global information access to the forager and
   its apparent ability to reach optimal choices. Despite relying only on
   limited past experience and hunger aversion, this behavioural rule not
   only accounts for nearly the same energy intake rate as predicted by the
   ODM but also can flexibly respond to changing environments by rapidly
   reaching new optimization. The RED behaviour also predicts a more
   realistic partial preference for diet choice, contrasting with the
   zero-one rule of OFT which allows for no partial preference within the
   forager's diet. The partial preference simply emerges from the RED
   strategy, as opposed to decision-making errors imposed from behavioural
   and physiological constraints. The RED rule further elucidates three
   potential traits that natural selection can act upon for optimizing
   foraging: (1) short-term memory of recent feeding experience, (2)
   ability to recognize encountered resources, and (3) basic neural set-up
   for alternative responses to environmental cues. This simple and
   flexible RED rule thus provides a behavioural mechanism for optimal
   foraging, and can be further applied to decision-making theory in
   psychology and economics. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{41-48}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Foraging activity in animals reflects a compromise between acquiring
   food and avoiding predation. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts
   that prey animals optimize this balance by concentrating their foraging
   activity at times of relatively low predation risk, as much as their
   energy status permits, but empirical evidence is scarce. We used a
   unique combination of automated telemetry, manual radiotelemetry and
   camera trapping to test whether activity at high risk times declined
   with food availability as predicted in a Neotropical forest rodent, the
   Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata. We found that the relative
   risk of predation by the main predator, the ocelot, Leopardus pardalis,
   estimated as the ratio of ocelot to agouti activity on camera trap
   photographs, was up to four orders of magnitude higher between sunset
   and sunrise than during the rest of the day. Kills of radiotracked
   agoutis by ocelots during this high-risk period far exceeded
   expectations given agouti activity. Both telemetric monitoring of
   radio-tagged agoutis and camera monitoring of burrow entrances indicated
   that agoutis exited their burrows later at dawn, entered their burrows
   earlier at dusk and had lower overall activity levels when they lived in
   areas with higher food abundance. Thus, agoutis avoided activity during
   the high-risk period more strongly when access to food was higher. Our
   study provides quantitative empirical evidence of prey animals
   concentrating their activity at times of relatively low predation risk.

Abstract = {{Can we reset, reprogram, rejuvenate, or reverse the organismal aging
   process? Certain genetic manipulations could at least reset and
   reprogram epigenetic dynamics beyond phenotypic plasticity and
   elasticity in cells, which can be manipulated further into organisms.
   However, in a whole complex aging organism, how can we rejuvenate
   intrinsic resources and infrastructures in an intact and noninvasive
   manner? The incidence of diseases increases exponentially with age,
   accompanied by progressive deteriorations of physiological functions in
   organisms. Aging-associated diseases are sporadic but essentially
   inevitable complications arising from senescence. Senescence is often
   considered the antithesis of early development, but yet there may be
   factors and mechanisms in common between these 2 phenomena to rejuvenate
   over the dynamic process of aging. The association between early
   development and late-onset disease with advancing age is thought to come
   from a consequence of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which
   one genotype can give rise to a range of physiologically and/or
   morphologically adaptive states based on diverse epigenotypes in
   response to intrinsic or extrinsic environmental cues and genetic
   perturbations. We hypothesized that the future aging process can be
   predictive based on adaptivity during the early developmental period.
   Modulating the thresholds and windows of plasticity and its robustness
   by molecular genetic and chemical epigenetic approaches, we have
   successfully conducted experiments to isolate zebrafish mutants
   expressing apparently altered senescence phenotypes during their
   embryonic and/or larval stages ({''}embryonic/larval senescence{''}).
   Subsequently, at least some of these mutant animals were found to show a
   shortened life span, whereas others would be expected to live longer
   into adulthood. We anticipate that previously uncharacterized
   developmental genes may mediate the aging process and play a pivotal
   role in senescence. On the other hand, unexpected senescence-related
   genes might also be involved in the early developmental process and its
   regulation. The ease of manipulation using the zebrafish system allows
   us to conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel genes, genotypes, and
   epigenotypes that can be linked to the senescence phenotype, which
   facilitates searching for the evolutionary and developmental origins of
   aging in vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{1. Stressful or stochastic environments may have significant selective
   effects, leading to increased plasticity or stress resistance.
   Starvation is a type of stress commonly encountered among organisms
   inhabiting stochastic environments. Indeed, starvation endurance is an
   important trait, especially in sit-and-wait predators, which experience
   frequent fluctuations in prey arrivals because of their limited
   mobility. Differences in starvation endurance between antlions
   originating from Mediterranean (benign and predictable) and desert
   (harsher and stochastic) regions were investigated by exposing them to
   starvation in a fully factorial experiment using climate chambers
   simulating Mediterranean or desert climatic conditions. A trade-off
   between growth rate and starvation endurance was also investigated by
   feeding the antlions at two different frequencies pre-starvation.
   Additionally, the existence of growth compensation was tested for by
   measuring relative growth rate when feeding was resumed post-starvation.
   Population of origin did not significantly affect rates of body mass
   loss during starvation or relative growth rates when feeding was
   resumed. Antlions that were fed less frequently during the feeding phase
   lost mass faster during the starvation phase, but grew faster during the
   compensation phase. This study emphasises the importance of testing
   responses to stress when investigating life-history trade-offs. Some
   phenotypic differences between populations might be apparent only when
   exposing the experimental organisms to external stress. Conversely,
   phenotypic differences apparent under stress-free conditions might be
   masked by the effects of the stress factor. Adopting such an integrative
   approach allows elucidation of the level of plasticity in response to
   stress in different populations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies in adults show associations between the
   hypofunctional seven-repeat allele (7R) of the dopamine-4 receptor gene
   (DRD4), increased eating behaviour and/or obesity, particularly in
   females. We examined whether 7R is associated with total caloric intake
   and/or food choices in pre-schoolers. Methods: 150 four-year-old
   children taking part in a birth cohort study in Canada were administered
   a snack test meal in a laboratory setting. Mothers also filled out a
   food frequency questionnaire to address childrens' habitual food
   consumption. Total caloric and individual macronutrient intakes during
   the snack meal and specific types of foods as reported in the food
   diaries were compared across 7R allele carriers vs. non-carriers, using
   current BMI as a co-variate. Results: We found significant sex by
   genotype interactions for fat and protein intake during the snack test.
   Post hoc testing revealed that in girls, but not boys, 7R carriers ate
   more fat and protein than did non-carriers. Based on the food diaries,
   across both sexes, 7R carriers consumed more portions of ice cream and
   less vegetables, eggs, nuts and whole bread, suggesting a less healthy
   pattern of habitual food consumption. Conclusion: The 7R allele of DRD4
   influences macronutrient intakes and specific food choices as early as
   four years of age. The specific pattern of results further suggests that
   prior associations between the 7R allele and adult overeating/obesity
   may originate in food choices observable in the preschool years.
   Longitudinal follow-up of these children will help establish the
   relevance of these findings for obesity risk and prevention. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Parents' use of restrictive feeding practices is counterproductive,
   increasing children's intake of restricted foods and risk for excessive

   Birch's (1999b) original findings that short-term restriction increases
   preschool children's (3-5 y) selection, intake, and behavioral response
   to restricted foods, and to identify characteristics of children who
   were more susceptible to the negative effects of restriction. The
   experiment used a within-subjects design; 37 children completed the food
   reinforcement task and heights/weights were measured. Parents reported
   on their use of restrictive feeding practices and their child's
   inhibitory control and approach. Overall, the findings replicated those
   of Fisher and Birch (1999b) and revealed that the effects of restriction
   differed by children's regulatory and appetitive tendencies. Greater
   increases in intake in response to restriction were observed among
   children lower in inhibitory control, higher in approach, who found the
   restricted food highly reinforcing, and who had previous experience with
   parental use of restriction. Results confirm that the use of restriction
   does not reduce children's consumption of these foods, particularly
   among children with lower regulatory or higher appetitive tendencies.

Abstract = {{Food choice and consumption behaviour are influenced by many interacting
   factors. In this paper we present an empirical effort to enhance
   understanding of the neophobia-neophilia forces affecting food choice.
   Starting from the analysis of consumer preferences for some of the most
   familiar highly processed foods, namely fat-reduced, functional
   (enriched drinks and yogurt) and ready-to-eat frozen food, our study
   investigates the role of traditional demographic variables vs attitudes
   to new food technologies in predicting the consumption behaviour of a
   sample of Italians buying such products. Consumer attitudes toward food
   technologies were collected by means of the Food Technology Neophobia
   Scale (FTNS). Moreover, this paper explicitly analyses the value of the
   information provided by the FTNS. Underlying the research is the
   hypothesis that the FTNS may contribute to provide a comprehensive
   picture of the driving forces behind consumers' behavioural responses
   towards processed foods which are the end-result of mature technologies.
   The four FTNS components, once measured and used independently, help
   clarify the influence on food choices of each neophobia-neophilia force
   (risk perception and novelty seeking, media influence, own health and
   environmental concerns) into a single, comprehensive framework. (C) 2013

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic stress on natural systems, particularly the fragmentation
   of landscapes and the extirpation of predators from food webs, has
   intensified the need to regulate abundance of wildlife populations with
   management. Controlling population growth using fertility control has
   been considered for almost four decades, but nearly all research has
   focused on understanding effects of fertility control agents on
   individual animals. Questions about the efficacy of fertility control as
   a way to control populations remain largely unanswered. Collateral
   consequences of contraception can produce unexpected changes in birth
   rates, survival, immigration and emigration that may reduce the
   effectiveness of regulating animal abundance. The magnitude and
   frequency of such effects vary with species-specific social and
   reproductive systems, as well as connectivity of populations. Developing
   models that incorporate static demographic parameters from populations
   not controlled by contraception may bias predictions of fertility
   control efficacy. Many population-level studies demonstrate that changes
   in survival and immigration induced by fertility control can compensate
   for the reduction in births caused by contraception. The most successful
   cases of regulating populations using fertility control come from
   applications of contraceptives to small, closed populations of
   gregarious and easily accessed species. Fertility control can result in
   artificial selection pressures on the population and may lead to
   long-term unintentional genetic consequences. The magnitude of such
   selection is dependent on individual heritability and behavioural
   traits, as well as environmental variation.Synthesis and applications.
   Understanding species' life-history strategies, biology, behavioural
   ecology and ecological context is critical to developing realistic
   expectations of regulating populations using fertility control. Before
   time, effort and funding are invested in wildlife contraception,
   managers may need to consider the possibility that many species and
   populations can compensate for reduction in fecundity, and this could
   minimize any reduction in population growth rate.
   Upland land use is associated with curlew declines, with predation a
   likely mechanism, and this may apply to other breeding waders. The
   removal of isolated woodland plantations from otherwise unafforested
   landscapes may help reduce predation pressure across a range of systems
   including moorland. However, direct predator control may also be
   important to conserve ground-nesting birds in these landscapes, for
   example, where moorland management and forestry coexist as major land
   uses. Predator control may also mitigate climate change effects by
   enhancing wader productivity, particularly where climate effects
   coincide with changing land use. Emerging land uses in open landscapes,
   including native woodland restoration and wind farms, require careful
   siting to minimize further impacts on open-area breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Recent research suggests that diet quality influences
   depression risk; however, a lack of experimental evidence leaves open
   the possibility that residual confounding explains the observed
   relationships. The aim of this study was to document the cross-sectional
   and longitudinal associations between dietary patterns and symptoms of
   depression and to undertake a detailed examination of potential
   explanatory factors, particularly socioeconomic circumstances, in the
   diet-depression relationship.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the Personality and Total Health (PATH)
   Through Life Study, a longitudinal community study following three age
   cohorts (20+; 40+; 60+ yrs) from south-eastern Australia over three
   assessment periods (n = 3663). Regression analyses evaluated the
   cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between dietary patterns,
   depressive symptoms, age, detailed measures of socioeconomic
   circumstances, other health behaviours, and cardiovascular risk factors.
   Results: The lowest tertile of prudent (healthy) dietary pattern and the
   highest tertile of western (unhealthy) dietary pattern were associated
   with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms. However, these
   contemporaneous associations were explained by adjustment for detailed
   measures of socioeconomic circumstances and physical activity. In
   prospective analyses, lower scores on the healthy dietary pattern and
   higher scores on the unhealthy dietary pattern independently predicted
   increased depressive symptoms across time, before and after adjustment
   for potential confounders and baseline depressive symptoms, but only for
   those in the oldest cohort. Dietary patterns did not explain the
   relationship between socioeconomic position and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that the relationship
   between habitual dietary intake and depressive symptoms is somewhat
   explained by socioeconomic circumstances and other health behaviours,
   but suggest that long term exposure to unhealthy dietary habits
   independently predisposes to depression over the lifecourse.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Resource subsidies increase the productivity of recipient food webs and
   can affect ecosystem dynamics. Subsidies of prey often support elevated
   predator biomass which may intensify top-down control and reduce the
   flow of reciprocal subsidies into adjacent ecosystems. However, top-down
   control in subsidized food webs may be limited if primary consumers
   posses morphological or behavioral traits that limit vulnerability to
   predation. In forested streams, terrestrial prey support high predator
   biomass creating the potential for strong top-down control, however
   armored primary consumers often dominate the invertebrate assemblage.
   Using empirically based simulation models, we tested the response of
   stream food webs to variations in subsidy magnitude, prey vulnerability,
   and the presence of two top predators. While terrestrial prey inputs
   increased predator biomass (+12\%), the presence of armored primary
   consumers inhibited top-down control, and diverted most aquatic energy
   (similar to 75\%) into the riparian forest through aquatic insect
   emergence. Food webs without armored invertebrates experienced strong
   trophic cascades, resulting in higher algal (similar to 50\%) and
   detrital (similar to 1600\%) biomass, and reduced insect emergence
   (-90\%). These results suggest prey vulnerability can mediate food web
   responses to subsidies, and that top-down control can be arrested even
   when predator-invulnerable consumers are uncommon (20\%) regardless of
   the level of subsidy.}},

Abstract = {{Alexandru George defined himself as a complex Romanian personality,
   though not really openly accepted, due to the diversity of his writings.
   A scholar indeed, quite intriguing through the vast culture and multiple
   literary ways of documentation, a master of disimulation and diplomacy,
   he possessed the rare gift of choosing the best moment of writing, so
   that to create an undeniable charisma. Thus, among 1970-1980, he mostly
   published critics, translations and short prose; the most difficult
   decade, politically talking, since 1980 to 1989, was devoted mainly to
   novels - the real expression of his talent; nevertheless, after the
   Revolution, until 2012, the year he had passed away, he profoundly
   switched the manner we got used to and finally turned into a political
   observer, hinting to great culture representatives, more or less
   involved in country's leadership, as well. Pro Libertate is a bunch of
   essays published in 1999, having as strategy the comparison of the past
   with the very present, aiming to important data exposing history and
   politics. However, what is supposed to be a type of analyse and distant
   observation keeps on changing into a subjective point of view, an inner
   display of lives and destinies devoted to the rise of a country, as seen
   by Alexandru George himself. The reader might experience the controversy
   to believe a writer who was probably a favourite of some communists,
   showing an intelectual hunger for spotless freedom, so far, or to simply
   allow to be informed, for the sake of being able to compare George,
   sometimes, to any other ``suitor{''}. Here are a few of the titles to
   remember: Ahead, ahead, again; A crucial moment; The failure of marxism;
   My teachers' betrayal; Where the monster came from.
   The wish to change has become an endless request for any Romanian and
   might be regarded as another misunderstanding for the term evolution.
   However, as any trauma has no rapid cure, the same imposibility of
   getting free and happy in some years should have darkened our
   countrymen's mind, in such a way, so that to lead to unbelievable
   thoughts and judgement. Thus, many pages of the tome are a subjective
   mixture of laudatio to great past and contemporary living images - such
   as Andrei Marga, C. Radulescu-Motru, Andrei Plesu or Florin Constantiniu
   - and also a deep complaint, challenged by curious reasons - young
   people's delusion, once they had left and chosen to study abroad, then
   coming back and not being able to adjust to local conditions; the birth
   of antagonistic feelings regarding the political colours, as seen from a
   different angle than the one established almost 100 years ago; the
   background of The Great Union in 1918, supported by monarchy and the
   most controversial directions ever, still coming since then; not to
   mention the rough debates and hidden battles concerning the so called
   Romanian true spirit, the one which developed among the nowadays
   intelectuals, including Alexandru George and his enemies - to come up
   only with S. Damian or Gabriela Adamesteanu, examples in point.}},

Abstract = {{By any of several measures, the health of the American population has
   been worsening over the last two decades. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and
   heart failure have risen dramatically. All the while, the average
   birthweight at all gestational ages has declined. The relationship
   between robust growth in the womb and lifelong health is now well
   established. Likewise, babies born at the low end of the birthweight
   scale are known to have highly elevated risks for ischemic heart
   disease, hypertension, stroke and metabolic disease. The biological
   mechanisms by which developmental plasticity becomes a risk for
   cardiovascular disease are only now being understood. Translating from
   animal and human studies, low birthweight babies are likely to have
   endothelial dysfunction, fewer nephrons, fewer pancreatic beta cells,
   less vascular elastin, fewer cardiomyocytes, increased sympathetic tone
   and liver-derived dyslipidemias. Only in the past few years, however,
   has it become known that maternal and placenta phenotypes are associated
   with adult onset cardiovascular disease. Helsinki Birth Cohort studies
   have been especially important in the discovery of these relationships.
   Sudden cardiac death is associated with a thin placenta and heart
   failure is associated with a small placenta in short mothers. Coronary
   heart disease is associated with three combinations of
   maternal-placental phenotypes. Because the diet is important in
   providing nutrients for the development of the female body before
   pregnancy and for providing nutrients during pregnancy, there is
   increasing evidence that the western diet is an underlying cause for the
   increase in metabolic disease in the American population. A large
   segment of the American population suffers from high calorie
   malnutrition. Scientists in this field now have a responsibility to
   educate the public on the topic of nutrition and health. This chapter
   honors Lawrence Longo for decades of work in bringing health to pregnant
   women and their babies.}},

Abstract = {{Food and beverage intake is the only behavior that animals, including
   human beings, must continually repeat in order to provide energy and
   chemical materials to the body. Recent epidemiological findings are
   poised to usher the science of nutrition into in a new era in which the
   consumption of specific whole foods, now called functional foods, is
   strongly associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, including
   cancer and cardiovascular diseases. These findings have led to the
   hypothesis that specific food components, in particular phenolic
   compounds, interact with the human organism at the organ, cellular, and
   molecular levels to trigger a preventive action against chronic
   diseases. Numerous bioactive compounds have been identified and isolated
   from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and are now present in all
   drugstores as dietary supplements to the usual intake of amino acids,
   vitamin, botanical compounds, and so on, although much basic information
   about their action in humans remains limited. For example, no
   stratification by sex has been performed in studies of their effects.
   Although human beings are mainly made up of men and women, in recent
   years it has become accepted that both biological sex and gender are
   prominent players in health and medicine. Until the last decade of the
   20th century, research on women was neglected and results obtained in
   men were directly translated to women, both in medicine and in
   nutrition. Different strategies have been developed in order to maintain
   male and female body homeostasis, implying that there are important
   differences in the bioavailability, metabolism, distribution, and
   elimination of bioactive compounds in males and in females. This article
   will review some of these differences underlying the possibility that

Title = {{Movement patterns and space use of maternal grizzly bears influence cub
   survival in Interior Alaska}},
Journal = {{URSUS}},

Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{121-138}},
Abstract = {{Foraging decisions and movement strategies by animals often involve a
   trade-off between meeting nutritional demands and minimizing risk of
   predation. We evaluated the influence of space use and movement patterns
   of maternal female grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) on cub (defined as first
   year of life) survival in eastern Interior Alaska, USA, during
   2008-2012. We monitored 9 GPS radiocollared females that produced 28
   cubs in 12 litters ((x) over bar litter size = 2.3, range = 2-3). The
   estimated annual cub survival rate was 0.39 (95\% CI = 0.20-0.57). In
   all cases the entire litter survived or died prior to den entrance. All
   cubs in a litter died either concurrently or within 14 days in 5 of 7
   litters lost. Sixty-nine percent of cub mortality occurred between 31
   May and 16 June. We did not document cub mortality before 31 May.
   Females with surviving cubs remained within 1 km of the den for a longer
   period following emergence than those that lost cubs. Between den
   emergence and the onset of vegetation green-up, females with surviving
   cubs used fewer habitat patches and remained in individual habitat
   patches longer than females that lost their cubs later in the summer.
   Females with surviving cubs exhibited different activity patterns
   compared with females that lost their cubs, particularly by moving less
   between midnight and mid-morning during 15 May-16 June. Once vegetation
   green-up occurred, movement rates of all maternal females were similar
   except that females with surviving cubs continued to move less during
   the morning hours (0000-1200 hr). We did not find evidence that the body
   size of the mother was a factor explaining cub survival nor was there
   evidence that cub survival was directly influenced by human causes. The
   most successful behavioral strategies used by maternal females to
   maximize cub survival appeared to be a combination of limiting movements
   to a few habitat patches between den emergence and vegetation green-up
   and limiting activity between midnight and mid-morning. We suggest that
   the ability to find and exploit suitable habitat patches during this
   period of limited resources may have allowed females to alter movements
   temporally and spatially and provision themselves and their cubs more
   effectively. This strategy was likely effective for both minimizing
   exposure to infanticidal adult bears and allowing cubs to maximize
   energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Suicide is a major cause of mortality for patients with
   eating disorders (ED), especially for patients with anorexia nervosa.
   Attempted suicide is also relatively common in patients with anorexia or
   bulimia nervosa. Aims: This study aimed at examining associations
   between attempted suicide and trait-and state-dependent characteristics
   in a large clinical population of ED patients. Method: The sample
   consisted of 1,436 in-and outpatients of the Centre for Eating Disorders
   of the Ghent University Hospital. Measures of ED symptoms,
   psychopathology, and personality traits were compared between ED
   patients with and ED patients without a history of attempted suicide.
   Results: A history of attempted suicide was found in 11.8\% of the ED
   patients and lifetime suicidal ideation was reported by 43.3\%.
   Multivariate analyses showed that a history of attempted suicide was
   associated with higher scores on depression, purging symptomatology,
   early-developed cognitive schemes (impaired autonomy and increased
   inhibition), and social insecurity. Conclusion: These findings support
   the increased risk of suicidal behavior in ED. The presence of
   particular personality traits, of cognitive schemes, and of purging and
   depressive symptoms should increase vigilance for suicidal behavior.}},

Title = {{Qualitative behavioural assessment of the motivation for feed in sheep
   in response to altered body condition score}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{922-929}},
Abstract = {{Qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) has been used to quantify the
   expressive behaviour of animals, and operant tests have been used to
   quantify measures of behavioural need. In this study we compared
   measures of behavioural expression and behaviour in operant tests. We
   examined the behavioural expression of pregnant ewes of body condition
   score (BCS) 2 and 3. The ewes were exposed to a feed motivation test in
   which they received a food reward. Pregnant ewes (48-70 days gestation)
   were assessed during a food motivation test after they had been
   maintained at BCS 3 (n = 7) or given a decreasing plane of nutrition
   that resulted in slow loss of 1 BCS unit (over 10-12 weeks; n = 7) or a
   fast loss of 1 BCS unit (over 4-6 weeks; n = 7). The feed motivation
   test involved ewes having the opportunity to approach a food reward and
   then being moved a given distance away from the reward by an automatic
   gate; they could then subsequently return to the feeder. Continuous
   video footage of each ewe during one cycle of the gate (approaching and
   returning from the food reward) was shown in random order to 11
   observers who used their own descriptive terms (free-choice profiling
   methodology; FCP) to score the animals using QBA. Data of the assessment
   were analysed with generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA), a multivariate
   statistical technique associated with FCP. The research group also
   quantified the feeding behaviour of sheep in the same clips. These
   behaviours included how sheep approached the feeder, behaviours
   exhibited at the feeder, and how sheep returned from the feeder. There
   was consensus amongst observers in terms of their assessment of
   behavioural expression of the sheep (P < 0.001). The GPA found three
   main dimensions of assessed behavioural expression in the sheep, which
   together explained 44\% of the variation observed. GPA dimension 1
   differed between the three treatment groups (P < 0.05): ewes maintained
   at BCS 3 scored low on GPA dimension 1 (i.e. were described as more
   calm/bored/comfortable) compared with ewes that had a slow declining BCS
   (described as more interested/anxious/excited). GPA dimension 2 scores
   were not significantly different between treatment groups. However,
   quantitative behaviours exhibited by sheep during the clips were
   correlated with qualitative behavioural assessments made by the
   observers. Animals that spent more time `sniffing and looking for more
   feed' were attributed lower GPA 2 scores (described as more
   hungry/searching/excited) (P < 0.05), and animals that `did not walk
   directly to the food reward (but stopped along the way)' were attributed
   significantly higher GPA 2 scores (more curious/intimidated/uneasy) (P <
   0.01). GPA dimension 3 scores also did not differ between the treatment
   groups; however, sheep that had a higher number of feeding events during
   the entire 23-h feed motivation test were attributed lower GPA dimension
   3 scores (they were described as more hungry/bold/interested) (P <
   0.05), and sheep that consumed a larger amount of the feed reward were
   attributed higher GPA dimension 3 scores (more
   curious/concerned/reserved) (P < 0.05). We conclude that QBA is a
   valuable method of assessing sheep behavioural expression under the
   conditions tested, in that it provided an integrative characterisation
   of sheep behavioural expression that was in agreement with quantitative
   behavioural measures of feeding.}},

   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The primary finding was a constant
   and clinically marked positive association between the HA temperament
   dimension and symptoms of PD, SAD and OCD, with a most marked effect in
   SAD, and a moderate effect in OCD and PD. Second, less marked and

   PD, SAD and OCD share a marked and state-dependent avoidant behavioral
   pattern, which is common for all anxiety disorders. However, PD showed a
   different pattern of arousal to novel stimuli from that of SAD and OCD.
   The findings are state dependent and based on cross-sectional studies.

Abstract = {{The system of Circadian Rhythms is a mechanism that, in the forms of
   animal life, has evolved in order to synchronize the behavior and
   physiological responses to environmental periodical stimuli, so as to
   allow faster response and better adaptation to environmental changes.
   These stimuli (light, food availability, presence of predators,
   availability of a partner for reproduction) in turn depend on the
   rotation of the earth on its axis and around the sun.
   In mammals, there is a central hypothalamic clock, said Master Clock,
   directly regulated by light in its periodicity, which therefore plays
   the role of primary synchronizer, and several peripheral clocks, Slave
   Clock, synchronized with each other and constantly reset the MC.
   Between external stinzuli food plays a fundamental role, as capable of
   take the place of the light in certain conditions.
   In recent years there has emerged a direct correlation between
   alteration of Circadian Rhythm, variously induced, and the development
   of multifactorial diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The biological
   clock is involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis and thus in
   search of food and in the regulation of body weight.
   The recent concept of chrono-nutrition, expressed perfectly the
   influence of food, through times of intake but also by its specific
   composition, is able to exert on the expression of regulatory genes of
   circadian rhythms, and therefore the maintenance or alteration of energy
   homeostasis of the organism.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity pervades organismal development and physiology
   where it facilitates an enormous range of adaptive responses to novel or
   stressful environments. Plasticity also impacts evolutionary processes,
   reducing the probability of population extinction in the face of
   environmental changes and sometimes increasing speciation rates in
   developmentally plastic lineages. Despite the adaptive significance of
   plasticity, organisms are not infinitely plastic; rather they are
   constrained in the kinds and ranges of environmental changes to which
   their body parts, organs, and tissues can respond. Understanding the
   nature, costs, and limits of developmental plasticity requires insight
   into (i) the developmental-genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying
   plastic responses as well as (ii) their interplay with ecological and
   social conditions. In this chapter we review and summarize recent
   progress in the development of horned beetles as a study system with
   which to explore the interactions between changing ecological conditions
   and plastic, genome-wide responses in gene expression and developmental
   function. In particular, we focus on plastic responses to nutritional
   variation, which in horned beetles differ widely as a function of body
   region, sex, and species. We begin by introducing the study system and
   summarize the developmental-genetic and genomic tool set currently
   available for horned beetles. We then present recently developed
   statistical approaches that can be used to guide the design of
   multi-factorial genome-wide transcriptional comparisons when

Abstract = {{Memory is a high-level brain function that enables organisms to adapt
   their behavioral responses to the environment, hence increasing their
   probability of survival. The Ras-ERK pathway is a key molecular
   intracellular signalling cascade for memory consolidation. In this
   chapter we will describe two main one-trial behavioral tests commonly
   used in the field of memory research in order to assess the role of
   Ras-ERK signalling in long-term memory: passive avoidance and object
   recognition.
   Passive avoidance (PA) is a fear-motivated instrumental learning task,
   designed by Jarvik and Essman in 1960, in which animals learn to refrain
   from emitting a behavioral response that has previously been associated
   with a punishment. We will describe here the detailed protocol and show
   some examples of how PA can reveal impairments or enhancements in memory
   consolidation following loss or gain of function genetic manipulations
   of the Ras-ERK pathway. The phenotypes of global mutants as Ras-GRF1 KO,
   GENA53, and ERK1 KO mice, as well as of conditional region-specific
   mutants (striatal K-CREB mice), will be illustrated as examples. Novel
   object recognition (NOR), developed by Ennaceur and Delacour in 1988, is
   instead a more recent and highly ecological test, which relies on the
   natural tendency of rodents to spontaneously approach and explore novel
   objects, representing hence a useful non-stressful tool for the study of
   memory in animals without the employment of punishments or
   starvation/water restriction regimens. Careful indications will be given
   on how to select the positions for the novel object, in order to
   counterbalance for individual side preferences among mice during the
   training. Finally, the methods for calculating two learning indexes will
   be described. In addition to the classical discrimination index (DI)
   that measures the ability of an animal to discriminate between two
   different objects which are presented at the same time, we will describe
   the formula of a new index that we present here for the first time, the
   recognition index (RI), which quantifies the ability of an animal's
   actual recognition memory.}},

   6 consecutive years by means of hydro-acoustic surveying. Prior to
   spawning, the herring were consistently located at a specific site
   characterised by a deep trench that led to the deepest basin in the
   system and provided a potential escape route from predators. As the
   herring approached spawning, they moved in the direction of the spawning
   grounds, mimicking the long-distance spawning migration of Norwegian
   spring-spawning herring. There were consistent trends across years in
   the school characteristics demonstrating state-dependent schooling
   dynamics. Schools were found closer to the bottom and more densely
   packed during late than early pre-spawning. Furthermore, a higher
   diversity in maturity stage be tween individual herring, assumed to be
   associated with stronger motivational conflicts, resulted in increased
   heterogeneity in school packing density. Our repeated investigations

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{499}},
Pages = {{259-273}},
Abstract = {{Seabirds of tropical oceanic waters have to cope with an extremely
   oligotrophic habitat, but little is known about their foraging behaviour
   and flexibility which enables them to catch sufficient prey for
   themselves and their chicks. In a 7 yr study encompassing contrasting
   oceanographic conditions, the foraging behaviour of chick-rearing
   Abbott's boobies Papasula abbotti, seabirds endemic to Christmas Island,
   Indian Ocean, was investigated using GPS- and diveloggers to examine (1)
   if the species exhibits foraging strategies that indicate specific
   adaptations to unproductive tropical oceanic waters, and (2) if (or how)
   the birds adjust their foraging behaviour to inter-annually varying
   marine conditions. Abbott's boobies displayed a number of distinct
   characteristics in their foraging behaviour: flight velocities were
   slower and diving activity lower than in other booby species. Foraging
   efficiency was enhanced by distinct temporal tuning of diving activity
   and trip timing, peaking in the morning and again in the afternoon. The
   birds exhibited some flexibility in foraging behaviour: when conditions
   deteriorated (i.e. when waters became warmer and less productive), their
   diet composition changed, they increased their trip durations, trip
   range and maximum dive depth, although other parameters such as diving
   activity and sinuosity did not change. Remarkably, the time spent on the
   water increased simultaneously with trip length. By those adaptations,
   Abbott's boobies were able to keep their body condition (as well as that
   of their chicks) stable even under poor marine conditions.}},

Title = {{Chemically mediated foraging by subtidal marine predators: a field test
   of tritrophic cues}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{498}},
Pages = {{161-U519}},
Abstract = {{Terrestrial insect predators and parasitoids commonly use volatile plant
   compounds released during grazing to find living herbivorous prey (i. e.
   tritrophic signaling). Because few studies have tested for tritrophic
   signaling in marine organisms, it is unclear if marine predators
   commonly use these fluid-borne cues to find living herbivore prey,
   especially under realistic settings. Such interactions might occur in
   the ocean because marine predators often use chemo sensory- based
   foraging, and herbivore-induced production of defensive chemistry is
   common in some algal taxa. To examine the ability of predators to find
   live herbivores using waterborne chemical cues from grazed algae, we
   tested the responses of marine predators to several baits using in situ
   trapping and video experiments. We tested the attractiveness of chemical
   cues released by (1) Macrocystis pyrifera and Ulva sp. actively grazed
   by herbivores for short-or longterm periods, (2) crushed herbivores, (3)
   positive controls containing fish carrion, or (4) negative controls.
   Most predators trapped and filmed were spiny lobsters Panulirus
   interruptus. Under realistic field conditions, chemical cues from
   actively grazed algae with live herbivores failed to attract predators,
   but chemical cues from crushed herbivores and fish carrion were highly
   attractive. Thus, while marine predators like lobsters may utilize
   fluid-borne chemical cues to find dead or injured prey, such cues appear

   142 terrestrial studies revealed that tritrophic cues were unrelated to

Abstract = {{Post-bariatric surgery patients are overrepresented in substance abuse
   treatment, particularly those who have had the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
   (RYGB) procedure. The severity of the substance use disorder (SUD; i.e.,
   warranting inpatient treatment) and related consequences necessitate a
   better understanding of the variables associated with post-RYGB SUDs.
   This investigation assessed factors associated with post-RYGB substance
   misuse. Post-RYGB patients (N = 141; at least 24 months postsurgery)
   completed an online survey assessing variables hypothesized to
   contribute to post-RYGB SUDs. Fourteen percent of participants met
   criteria for postoperative substance misuse. Those with a lower percent
   total weight loss (\%TWL) were more likely to endorse substance misuse.
   Family history of substance misuse was strongly associated with
   postoperative substance misuse. Eating-related variables including
   presurgical food addiction and postsurgical nocturnal eating, subjective
   hunger, and environmental responsiveness to food cues were also
   associated with a probable postoperative SUD. These findings have
   clinical utility in that family history of substance misuse can be
   easily assessed, and at-risk patients can be advised accordingly. In
   addition, those who endorse post-RYGB substance misuse appear to have
   stronger cognitive and behavioral responses to food, providing some
   support for the theory of behavioral substitution (or ``addiction
   transfer{''}).}},

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Parental care promotes offspring survival and, for livestock species,
   this care is provided solely by the mother. Maternal behaviour in the
   sheep has been exceptionally well-studied compared with other species
   and many of the underpinning biological processes leading to the
   expression of maternal care are known. In this review the current state
   of play with regard to the biology of maternal care will be reviewed,
   and its application to provide practical solutions to reduce lamb
   mortality considered. For maternal care to be elicited at birth the ewe
   requires elevated circulating oestradiol in late gestation, which
   stimulates the expression of oxytocin receptors in both peripheral and
   central areas (particularly the hypothalamic and limbic areas of the
   brain). At birth stretching of the vaginocervical canal elicits a spinal
   reflex which triggers the release of oxytocin primarily from neurones
   within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Oxytocin release
   causes an increase in the neurotransmitters noradrenaline,
   acetylcholine, glutamate and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the olfactory
   bulb, and other brain regions important for maternal behaviour. Finally,
   sensory cues provided by the lamb, in particular the amniotic fluids
   surrounding it, lead to the expression of maternal behaviours (licking,
   low-pitched bleats, acceptance of the lamb at the udder and suckling).
   This allows the expression of the two facets of maternal behaviour in
   the ewe: nurturance of the young and maternal selectivity, whereby a
   specific olfactory memory for the ewes own lamb is formed and the
   expression of maternal care is restricted to this lamb. Variation in the
   expression of maternal care has been demonstrated in primiparous ewes
   compared with multiparous, in different sheep genotypes, with
   undernutrition, stress in pregnancy, following a difficult delivery, and
   may occur with variation in ewe temperament. An understanding of the
   importance of the timing of various events in late pregnancy and during
   parturition, as well as the factors that can disrupt these events, can
   help to design management activities to minimise risks to the successful
   onset of maternal behaviour. Management practices that work with the
   biology of the ewe will be the most successful in ensuring that maternal
   care is expressed, so improving the welfare of the ewe and lamb, and the
   profitability of the farm.}},

Abstract = {{The Look AHEAD trial, evaluating the effects of weight loss on
   cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in overweight/obese people
   with type 2 diabetes (T2D), was interrupted after a median 9.5-year
   follow-up because the incidence of CV events was not different between
   the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) and the control groups, and
   unlikely to statistically change thereafter. This made health providers
   and patients wondering about clinical value of diet and physical
   exercise in diabetic patients. Many factors may have made difficult to
   ascertain benefits of lifestyle intervention, besides the lower than
   predicted CV event rates. Among others, LDL-cholesterol was lowered
   more, with a higher use of statins, in the control group. Anyhow, ILI
   significantly improved numerous health conditions, including quality of
   life, CV risk factors and blood glucose control, with more diabetes
   remissions and less use of insulin.
   The intervention aimed at weight loss by reducing fat calories, and
   using meal replacements and, eventually, orlistat, likely
   underemphasizing dietary composition. There is suggestive evidence, in
   fact, that qualitative changes in dietary composition aiming at higher
   consumption of foods rich in fiber and with a high vegetable/animal fat
   ratio favorably influence CV risk in T2D patients.
   In conclusion, the Look AHEAD showed substantial health benefits of
   lifestyle modifications. Prevention of CV events may need higher
   attention to dietary composition, contributing to stricter control of CV
   risk factors. As a better health-related quality of life in people with
   diabetes is an important driver of our clinical decisions, efforts on
   early implementation of behavioral changes through a multifactorial
   approach are strongly justified. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{225-237}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The costs and benefits of alternative migratory strategies are often
   framed in the context of top-down and bottom-up effects on individual
   fitness. This occurs because migration is considered a costly behavioral
   strategy that presumably confers explicit benefits to migrants in the
   form of either decreased predation risk (predation risk avoidance
   hypothesis) or increased nutrition (forage maturation hypothesis). To
   test these hypotheses, we studied a partially migratory moose (Alces
   alces) population and contrasted explicit measures of predation risk
   (i.e., offspring survival) and nutrition (i.e., accumulation of
   endogenous energy reserves) between resident and migratory
   subpopulations. We relied on data collected from migratory and
   nonmigratory radio-marked moose (n = 67) that inhabited a novel study
   system located in coastal Alaska between 2004 and 2010. In this area,
   30\% of the population resides year-round on a coastal foreland area,
   while 48\% migrate to either a small island archipelago or a subalpine
   ridge system (the remainder exhibited one of six different
   low-occurrence strategies). Overall, we determined that accumulation of
   body fat during the growing season did not differ between migratory or
   resident modalities. However, calf survival was 2.6-2.9 times higher for
   individuals that migrated (survival, islands = 0.49 +/- 0.16 {[}mean +/-
   SE], n = 35; ridge = 0.52 +/- 0.16, n = 33) than those that did not
   (survival, resident = 0.19 +/- 0.08, n = 57). Our results support the
   predation risk avoidance hypotheses, and suggest that migration is a
   behavioral strategy that principally operates to reduce the risk of calf
   predation and does not confer explicit nutritional benefits. We did not
   directly detect trade-offs between predation risk and nutrition for
   migratory individuals. Yet we identify an indirect life history
   mechanism that may mildly dampen the apparent fitness benefits of
   migration. The proximate factors accounting for differences in
   migration-specific neonate survival are likely linked to accessibility
   of refugial habitats for moose at local and landscape scales, landscape
   factors that affect hunting efficacy of large carnivores, and
   interactions with rural human communities. Conservation of ungulate
   populations can be aided by integrating knowledge about migratory
   behavior, life history strategies, and factors that alter ungulate
   vulnerability, particularly those induced by human activity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Swallowing problems following stroke may result in increased
   risk of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration.
   Objective/hypothesis: Our hypothesis was that three neurostimulation
   techniques would produce beneficial effects on chronic dysphagia
   following stroke through a common brain mechanism that would predict
   behavioral response.
   Methods: In 18 dysphagic stroke patients (mean age: 66 +/- 3 years, 3
   female, time-post-stroke: 63 +/- 15 weeks {[}+/- SD]), pharyngeal
   electromyographic responses were recorded after single-pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the pharyngeal motor
   cortex, to measure corticobulbar excitability before, immediately, and
   30 min, after real and sham applications of neurostimulation. Patients
   were randomized to a single session of either: pharyngeal electrical
   stimulation (PES), paired associative stimulation (PAS) or repetitive
   TMS (rTMS). Penetration-aspiration scores and bolus transfer timings
   were assessed before and after both real and sham interventions using
   videofluoroscopy.
   Results: Corticobulbar excitability of pharyngeal motor cortex was
   beneficially modulated by PES, PAS and to a lesser extent by rTMS, with
   functionally relevant changes in the unaffected hemisphere. Following
   combining the results of real neurostimulation, an overall increase in
   corticobulbar excitability in the unaffected hemisphere (P = .005,
   F-1,F-17 = 10.6, ANOVA) with an associated 15\% reduction in aspiration
   (P = .005, z = -2.79) was observed compared to sham.
   Conclusions: In this mechanistic study, an increase in corticobulbar
   excitability the unaffected projection was correlated with the
   improvement in swallowing safety (P = .001, rho = -.732), but
   modality-specific differences were observed. Paradigms providing
   peripheral input favored change in neurophysiological and behavioral
   outcome measures in chronic dysphagia patients. Further larger cohort
   studies of neurostimulation in chronic dysphagic stroke are imperative.

Title = {{When things go wrong: intra-season dynamics of breeding failure in a
   seabird}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{During breeding, long-lived species face important time and energy
   constraints that can lead to breeding failure when food becomes scarce.
   Despite the potential implications of intra-season dynamics in breeding
   failure for individual behavior, carry-over effects, dispersal decisions
   and population dynamics, little information is currently available on
   these dynamics at fine temporal scales. Here, we monitored the foraging
   behavior and the proportion of successful black-legged kittiwake pairs
   from nest construction to chick fledging in a colony of the southern
   Barents Sea, to relate foraging effort to the dynamics of breeding
   failure over an entire breeding season, and to infer the environmental
   conditions leading to this failure. Specifically, we tracked kittiwakes
   with GPS and satellite tags during incubation and early chick-rearing to
   document nest attendance, foraging range, time budgets and daily energy
   expenditures (DEE). We also monitored diet changes over time. We
   predicted that breeding failure would follow a non-linear trend
   characterized by a break point after which breeding success would drop
   abruptly and would be related to a substantial increase in foraging
   effort. Kittiwakes showed contrasting foraging patterns between
   incubation and chick-rearing: they extended their foraging range from 20
   km during incubation to more than 450 km during chick-rearing and
   switched diet. They also increased their DEE and readjusted their time
   budgets by increasing time spent at sea. These changes corresponded to a
   break point in breeding dynamics beyond which the proportion of
   successful pairs abruptly dropped. At the end of the season, less than
   10\% of kittiwake pairs raised chicks in the monitored plots. This
   integrative study confirms that breeding failure is a non-linear process
   characterized by a threshold beyond which individuals face an energetic
   trade-off and cannot simultaneously sustain high reproductive and
   self-maintenance efforts. In this way, the occurrence of sudden
   environmental changes complicates our ability to predict population
   dynamics and poses conservation challenges.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{45-51}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of sexual selection on nonsexual fitness is a major
   unanswered question in evolutionary biology that may have important
   implications for adaptation, diversification and the evolution of mate
   preferences. If reproductive success is condition dependent, the
   resulting sexual selection will tend to align with natural selection,
   promoting adaptation. One prediction under such a scenario is that
   adaptation to a novel environment should increase male mating success
   and hence sexual fitness. Environmentally induced plasticity in mate
   preferences could also contribute to an alignment of natural and sexual
   selection if the changes cause females to prefer locally adapted males
   as mates. We tested for both forms of alignment using a set of 10
   independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster that were adapted to
   one of two environments. Competitive mating trials were performed
   between pairs of populations adapted to these two environments, with the
   trials designed to separate the effects of local adaptation on male
   mating success from plasticity of female mate preferences in response to
   these environments. Contrary to expectations under an alignment of
   natural and sexual selection, males did not have higher mating success
   when competing in the environment to which they were adapted.
   Furthermore, there was no evidence that females altered their mate
   choice based on their rearing environment, indicating the absence of any
   adaptive plasticity in mate preferences. Overall, despite previous
   evidence of reciprocal adaptation to these different environments,
   increased nonsexual fitness did not translate into higher mating
   success, indicating a lack of any alignment with natural selection of
   this component of male sexual fitness. (C) 2013 The Association for the

   propensity}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{137-146}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Natal dispersal contributes to population dynamics and genetic
   structure. Individuals differ in whether or not they disperse and in the
   distance they travel from their natal site before settling to breed.
   Differences in natal dispersal are often associated with variation in
   other traits. These associations may arise because suites of
   morphological and behavioural traits are ultimately controlled by the
   same set of genes. The genes that control melanogenesis in vertebrates
   pleiotropically influence physiology and behaviour, including boldness
   and exploration. Because these personality traits predict dispersal, we
   tested the hypothesis that in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, melanic
   coloration predicts natal dispersal, using a solid matched case-control
   sampling design and a large sample. We found that males but not females
   with colour traits that reflect relatively more pheomelanic feather
   pigmentation were more likely to disperse, consistently with
   observations on the only other species for which dispersal in relation
   to plumage melanic coloration has so far been studied. To control for
   any confounding effects, we also analysed the association of dispersal
   with morphological traits and parasite infestation. Philopatric
   individuals were larger than dispersers, whereas dispersal strategy did
   not differ according to tail length, which is a sexually selected trait.
   Finally, philopatric females had a smaller infestation of a
   haematophagous louse fly. The present findings corroborate previous
   evidence that melanic coloration covaries with a suite of traits. In
   particular, they show that melanin-based plumage coloration predicts
   natal dispersal, independently of other factors also influencing
   dispersal. In addition, our results show that philopatric individuals
   were larger than dispersers possibly because individuals return to a
   benign natal place or because large body size confers an advantage in
   competitive interactions. Finally, they are compatible with the idea of
   host adaptation to local strains of a parasite with presumably small
   population size and low dispersing capacity. (C) 2013 The Association

Abstract = {{A growing body of research over the past decade indicates that
   interindividual variation in behavior can result from a variety of
   factors. Two important sources of this variation are behavioral
   plasticity (adaptive variation in behavior) and behavioral type (i.e.,
   an individual with consistent behavioral differences across one or more
   situations). Although oviposition-site selection (OS) is widespread and
   affects both parents and offspring, it has been overlooked in the
   context of the behavioral type. Thus, we used the Texas field cricket
   (Gryllus texensis) to determine if OS could be integrated into the
   behavioral type paradigm and if a relevant environmental variable (food
   limitation) influences behavioral type. We found that behavioral type
   was consistent across contexts because individuals exhibiting riskier
   (bolder) behavior in a novel environment also exhibited riskier behavior
   during oviposition. Also, individuals traded off safety with food
   availability during ovipositionuthat is, fasted crickets were more
   likely to choose food over safety (shelter) when making an oviposition
   decision. Last, relative to fed crickets, those that were fasted
   oviposited fewer eggs during overnight trials in which food was
   available. By integrating a behavior tightly linked to multigenerational
   fitness with an established behavioral assay (behavior to novel

Title = {{Climate warming causes life-history evolution in a model for Atlantic
   cod (Gadus morhua)}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Climate change influences the marine environment, with ocean warming
   being the foremost driving factor governing changes in the physiology
   and ecology of fish. At the individual level, increasing temperature
   influences bioenergetics and numerous physiological and life-history
   processes, which have consequences for the population level and beyond.
   We provide a state-dependent energy allocation model that predicts
   temperature-induced adaptations for life histories and behaviour for the
   North-East Arctic stock (NEA) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in response
   to climate warming. The key constraint is temperature-dependent
   respiratory physiology, and the model includes a number of trade-offs
   that reflect key physiological and ecological processes. Dynamic
   programming is used to find an evolutionarily optimal strategy of
   foraging and energy allocation that maximizes expected lifetime
   reproductive output given constraints from physiology and ecology. The
   optimal strategy is then simulated in a population, where survival,
   foraging behaviour, growth, maturation and reproduction emerge. Using
   current forcing, the model reproduces patterns of growth, size-at-age,
   maturation, gonad production and natural mortality for NEA cod. The
   predicted climate responses are positive for this stock; under a 2
   degrees C warming, the model predicted increased growth rates and a
   larger asymptotic size. Maturation age was unaffected, but gonad weight
   was predicted to more than double. Predictions for a wider range of
   temperatures, from 2 to 7 degrees C, show that temperature responses
   were gradual; fish were predicted to grow faster and increase
   reproductive investment at higher temperatures. An emergent pattern of
   higher risk acceptance and increased foraging behaviour was also
   predicted. Our results provide important insight into the effects of
   climate warming on NEA cod by revealing the underlying mechanisms and
   drivers of change. We show how temperature-induced adaptations of
   behaviour and several life-history traits are not only mediated by
   physiology but also by trade-offs with survival, which has consequences
   for conservation physiology.}},

Title = {{Boldness and Stress Responsiveness as Drivers of Nest-Site Selection in
   a Ground-Nesting Bird}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nest-site selection involves trade-offs between the probability of nest
   discovery by egg predators, danger to the incubating parent from
   predators and provision of an appropriate microclimate for incubation,
   and all three components are potentially influenced by nest concealment
   and distance to habitat edge. Personality traits also affect habitat
   choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable
   stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize
   either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping),
   both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this
   hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks
   (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with
   attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further
   away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential
   expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this
   prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition
   and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses
   and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their
   repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the
   clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our
   prediction was supported: bold females {[}short flight initiation
   distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature
   were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower
   handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther
   from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at
   intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with
   increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus
   be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be
   manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Prey can invest in a variety of defensive traits when balancing risk of
   predation against that of starvation. What remains unknown is the
   relative costs of different defensive traits and how prey reconcile
   investment into these traits when energetically limited. We tested the
   simple allocation model of prey defense, which predicts an additive
   effect of increasing predation risk and resource availability, resulting
   in the full deployment of defensive traits under conditions of high risk
   and resource saturation. We collected morphometric, developmental, and
   behavioural data in an experiment using dragonfly larvae (predator) and
   Northern leopard frog tadpoles (prey) subject to variable levels of food
   availability and predation risk. Larvae exposed to food restriction
   showed limited response to predation risk; larvae at food saturation
   altered behaviour, development, and growth in response to predation
   risk. Responses to risk varied through time, suggesting ontogeny may
   affect the deployment of particular defensive traits. The observed
   negative correlation between body size and activity level for
   food-restricted prey - and the absence of a similar response among
   adequately-fed prey - suggests that a trade-off exists between
   behavioural and growth responses when energy budgets are limited. Our
   research is the first to demonstrate how investment into these defensive
   traits is mediated along gradients of both predation risk and resource
   availability over time. The interactions we demonstrate between resource
   availability and risk level on deployment of inducible defenses provide
   evidence that both internal condition and extrinsic risk factors play a
   critical role in the production of inducible defenses over time.}},

Abstract = {{1. The mechanistic basis for and adaptive significance of variation in
   female sperm storage organs are important for a range of questions
   concerning sexual selection and speciation, as such variation influences
   the evolutionary trajectories of male fertilization related traits and
   may facilitate speciation through its effects on gamete recognition.
   2. Female yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria) usually develop
   three sperm storage compartments, and this subdivision may be an
   adaptation for sorting sperm during postcopulatory choice.
   3. Using lines artificially selected to express four spermathecae (4s),
   we explored the fitness consequences of the novel phenotype relative to
   the naturally prevalent three-spermatheca (3s) phenotype by manipulating
   the opportunity for postcopulatory sexual selection (females mated
   either with three or only one male prior to oviposition). In addition,
   we examined the developmental plasticity of spermathecal number in
   response to different larval food environments and estimated its genetic
   correlation with growth rate.
   4. Mating treatments with and without the opportunity for postcopulatory
   sexual selection revealed no significant fitness differences between
   alternative spermathecal phenotypes within selection lines despite
   overall benefits associated with multiple mating, and moderate
   egg-to-adult survival costs in response to artificial selection for 4s.
   Manipulations of the larval food environment revealed that the
   expression of 4s is highly plastic and tightly linked to environmental
   conditions promoting fast somatic growth and development. Likewise,
   siblings with fast intrinsic (genetic) growth were more likely to
   express 4s within and across food environments.
   5. The present results highlight a great potential for rapid
   evolutionary change in female sperm storage morphology through indirect
   selection on life-history traits, and further suggest genetic
   assimilation as a potential mechanism facilitating phylogenetic
   transitions in spermatheca number as frequently observed within the
   Dipterans.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes are commonly used to examine various aspects of animal
   ecology. The use of stable isotopes generally proceeds under the
   implicit assumption that resource use is the only factor driving
   variation in stable isotope levels; however, a wealth of studies
   demonstrate that a range of common ecological factors can affect the
   behavior of stable isotopes in animal tissues and potentially confound
   inferences. For example, studies of some invertebrates and endothermic
   vertebrates show that animals fasted for ecologically realistic time
   periods have higher nitrogen (delta N-15) or lower carbon (delta C-13).
   We examined whether realistic fasting would influence the stable isotope
   composition of one of the most metabolically efficient ectothermic
   vertebrates, the Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus. We
   fasted salamanders for 7, 14, 21, 28, or 35-day intervals and examined
   whether delta N-15 or delta C-13 levels of tissues changed between
   fasted and fed animals. We investigated whether body condition (body
   mass to length and C:N {[}an index of lipid levels]) declined in fasted
   animals and whether there was a relationship between C:N and delta N-15
   or delta C-13. Body mass to length index and C:N, delta C-13, and delta
   N-15 of tail and liver tissues did not differ between fasted and fed
   animals between 7 and 35 days. Because of their extreme metabolic
   efficiency, vertebrate ectotherms such as lungless salamanders
   (Plethodontidae) may not show the effects of fasting on stable isotopes
   observed in endothermic vertebrates and some invertebrates. This
   difference should lead to simpler interpretation of stable isotope
   results from field studies of these animals.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) thermal lasers have previously been validated for
   the assessment of nociception in cats. This experiment sought to assess
   the potential impact of factors associated with age, sex, body weight
   and sterilisation upon nociceptive threshold as measured by latency to
   display a behavioural response. Cats (N= 113) were exposed to a CO2
   thermal laser three times during a 45-60 min test period depending upon
   the interval between tests. A minimum of 15 min elapsed between
   consecutive tests on any one individual. Time to display either a skin
   twitch or withdrawal was measured. Intra-class correlations showed the
   three measurements to be repeatable across tests for any given cat (ICC
   = 0.482; P < 0.001). Males had a significantly longer mean latency to
   respond than females (14.83 s and 12.59 s respectively; P = 0.028).
   Analyses of co-variance established that the body weight of females
   significantly affected response threshold (P=0.013) but for males this
   effect was marginal (P = 0.058). All other factors included in the
   analyses were non-significant. A post hoc t-test for males and females
   with overlapping body weights found no significant differences between
   the sexes (P = 0.721). The precise reason for the effect of body weight
   on latency to respond is unknown and further exploration is needed
   particularly as it relates to subcutaneous fat deposition and skin
   temperature. It is concluded that, for cats, the body weight of the
   subject should be standardised or included in any analyses for
   assessment of nociception. Inclusion of body weight data in analyses may
   also prove useful when using a CO2 laser protocol in other species. (C)

Abstract = {{Exposure to adverse environmental conditions during early development
   can shape life-history traits and have lasting effects on physiological
   function in later life. Although findings within the biomedical
   literature have shown that environmentally induced elevations in
   glucocorticoids (GCs) during critical developmental windows can cause
   persistent carry-over effects (i.e., developmental programming), little
   is known about whether such effects of GCs can be generalized to
   wildlife species. Using wood frogs as a study species, we conducted an
   experiment with a split-plot design to assess the short-term and the
   long-term physiological consequences of availability of food,
   hydroperiod length (i.e., pond drying), and the interaction between
   these two environmental conditions. In outdoor experimental ponds, we
   reared tadpoles in chronically high or low-food conditions, and tadpoles
   from each pond experienced either high water until metamorphosis or a
   reduction in water volume during late developmental stages (after Gosner
   stage 38). After metamorphosis, animals were housed individually and fed
   ad libitum for 10 weeks, and growth rate, fat content, and resting and
   acute stress-induced GC levels were measured. We found that tadpoles
   experiencing low availability of food and reduced water volume had
   elevated GC levels, reduced mass, and body condition as they approached
   metamorphosis. At 10 weeks after metamorphosis, we found that these two
   conditions also had persistent interactive effects on post-metamorphic
   allocation of resources to growth, energy storage, and responsiveness of
   GCs to a novel stressor. Of individuals that experienced reduced water
   volume, only those that experienced high food as tadpoles were able to
   catch up to individuals that did not experience reduced water volume in
   terms of body mass, femur length, and body condition, and they allocated
   more resources to fat storage. By contrast, 10-week old frogs with
   low-food and that experienced low water volume and low-food levels as
   tadpoles allocated fewer resources to mass-specific growth, stored less
   fat, and exhibited blunted GC response to a novel stressor relative to
   those that did not experience water-reduction. Our findings demonstrate
   that environmental conditions experienced prior to and during important
   developmental transitions shape resource allocation and the ability to
   physiologically respond to future stressors in juvenile and potentially
   adult animals. These results suggest that chronic and acute
   environmental stressors experienced during early life stages can have
   cumulative and interactive effects that need to be considered when
   modeling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental
   change on populations.}},

Abstract = {{In social mammals, within-group competition for food can drive variation
   in female fitness. Frugivores may face particularly strong competition
   because they use patchily distributed usurpable resources. Dominance
   rank and group size influence how a female experiences within-group
   competition. Both are predicted to affect access to food and, thus,
   reproductive success. We used 15 years of behavioral, demographic, and
   reproductive data from wild frugivorous blue monkeys to examine effects
   of rank and group size on the probability that a female conceived. We
   used generalized linear mixed models, controlling for potentially
   confounding maternal and environmental factors. Blue monkey females
   compete aggressively and disproportionately for fruits and exhibit
   linear dominance hierarchies, but neither rank index we tested
   significantly predicted the probability of conception. Although earlier
   studies found that group size effects on activity budgets were minimal,
   we found that group size had a quadratic relationship with the
   probability of conception, which peaked at around 31 members. The lack
   of a rank effect may reflect behavioral strategies (e.g., switching
   resources, spreading out during feeding, using cheek pouches) that
   minimize the strength of within-group competition, thus facilitating
   group-level cooperation in between-group contests. The significant
   quadratic effect of group size on reproduction may occur if individuals
   in small groups do not obtain the full benefits of group living (e.g.,
   predator avoidance, increased foraging success, communal care for
   offspring) and those in large groups experience a lower quality diet or
   constrained feeding time. Ultimately, measures of reproduction are
   preferable to behavioral proxies for accurately assessing within-group

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Molecular imaging studies with positron emission tomography have
   revealed that the availability of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in the
   human brain fluctuates over the course of the year. This effect is most
   pronounced in carriers of the short allele of the 5-HTT promoter region
   (5-HTTLPR), which has in several previous studies been linked to an
   increased risk to develop mood disorders. We argue that long-lasting
   fluctuations in the cerebral serotonin transmission, which is regulated
   via the 5-HTT, are responsible for mediating responses to environmental
   changes based on an assessment of the expected ``safety{''} of the
   environment; this response is obtained in part through serotonergic
   modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We posit
   that the intermediate phenotype of the s-allele may properly be
   understood as mediating a trade-off, wherein increased responsiveness of
   cerebral serotonin transmission to seasonal and other forms of
   environmental change imparts greater behavioral flexibility, at the
   expense of increased vulnerability to stress. This model may explain the
   somewhat higher prevalence of the s-allele in some human populations
   dwelling at geographic latitudes with pronounced seasonal climatic
   changes, while this hypothesis does not rule out that genetic drift
   plays an additional or even exclusive role. We argue that s-allele
   manifests as an intermediate phenotype in terms of an increased
   responsiveness of the 5-HTT expression to number of daylight hours,
   which may serve as a stable surrogate marker of other environmental
   factors, such as availability of food and safety of the environment in
   populations that live closer to the geographic poles.}},

Abstract = {{Cane toads (Rhinella marina) have wrought considerable ecological damage
   during their invasion of tropical Australia, spurring the search for
   novel ways to reduce toad numbers. Previous laboratory and field studies
   have shown that the tadpoles of native frogs, which often co-occur with
   toad tadpoles in temporary waterbodies, compete with the invaders and
   can suppress their survival, growth and development. Understanding the
   mechanisms responsible for that competitive suppression might suggest
   new ways to control toads: for example, a chemical produced by native
   tadpoles that disrupts toad development. Our laboratory experiments
   confirm that toad tadpoles are negatively affected by the presence of
   tadpoles of three native hylid frogs (Litoria caerulea, Litoria longipes
   and Litoria splendida) and identify direct exploitative competition for
   food as the primary mechanism. Manipulations of chemical cues and visual
   cues in the water had no significant effects on the viability of toads,
   whereas manipulations of direct physical contact and food supply
   relative to tadpole density had strong effects. The lack of chemically
   mediated interference competition may reflect the very short timescale
   of sympatry between the invader and native taxa, restricting
   opportunities for the evolution of such mechanisms. Re-introducing
   native anurans to anthropogenically degraded sites (especially those
   where local frogs previously occurred, but have been lost) may provide a
   simple and effective way to reduce the recruitment rate of invasive cane
   toads.}},

   increase reproduction. Therefore, we expected that in winter and spring
   samples, when only OW can be sampled, the animals should be shyer than
   in summer and autumn, when both OW and YY animals can be sampled. We
   studied common vole (Microtus arvalis) populations, which express
   typical, intra-annual density fluctuation. We captured a total of 492
   voles at different months over 3 years and examined boldness and
   activity level with two standardised behavioural experiments.
   Results: Behavioural variables of the two tests were correlated with
   each other. Boldness, measured as short latencies in both tests, was
   extremely high in spring compared to other seasons. Activity level was
   highest in spring and summer, and higher in males than in females.
   Conclusion: Being bold in laboratory tests may translate into higher
   risk-taking in nature by being more mobile while seeking out partners or
   valuable territories. Possible explanations include asset-protection,
   with OW animals being rather old with low residual reproductive value in
   spring. Therefore, OW may take higher risks during this season.
   Offspring born in spring encounter a lower population density and may
   have higher reproductive value than offspring of later cohorts. A
   constant connection between life history and animal personality, as
   suggested by the POL theory, however, was not found. Nevertheless,
   correlations of traits suggest the existence of animal personalities. In
   conclusion, complex patterns of population dynamics, seasonal variation
   in life histories, and variability of behaviour due to asset-protection
   may cause complex seasonal behavioural dynamics in a population.}},

Title = {{Intra- and Trans-Generational Costs of Reduced Female Body Size Caused
   by Food Limitation Early in Life in Mites}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Food limitation early in life may be compensated for by
   developmental plasticity resulting in accelerated development enhancing
   survival at the expense of small adult body size. However and especially
   for females in non-matching maternal and offspring environments, being
   smaller than the standard may incur considerable intra-and
   transgenerational costs.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we evaluated the costs of small
   female body size induced by food limitation early in life in the
   sexually size-dimorphic predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Females
   are larger than males. These predators are adapted to exploit ephemeral
   spider mite prey patches. The intra- and trans-generational effects of
   small maternal body size manifested in lower maternal survival
   probabilities, decreased attractiveness for males, and a reduced number
   and size of eggs compared to standard-sized females. The
   trans-generational effects of small maternal body size were sex-specific
   with small mothers producing small daughters but standard-sized sons.
   Conclusions/Significance: Small female body size apparently intensified
   the well-known costs of sexual activity because mortality of small but
   not standard-sized females mainly occurred shortly after mating. The
   disadvantages of small females in mating and egg production may be
   generally explained by size-associated morphological and physiological
   constraints. Additionally, size-assortative mate preferences of
   standard-sized mates may have rendered small females disproportionally
   unattractive mating partners. We argue that the sex-specific
   trans-generational effects were due to sexual size dimorphism females
   are the larger sex and thus more strongly affected by maternal stress
   than the smaller males - and to sexually selected lower plasticity of
   male body size.}},

Title = {{Perplexities of treatment resistence in eating disorders}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Treatment resistance is an omnipresent frustration in eating
   disorders. Attempts to identify the features of this resistance and
   subsequently develop novel treatments have had modest effects. This
   selective review examines treatment resistant features expressed in core
   eating disorder psychopathology, comorbidities and biological features.
   Novel treatments addressing resistance are discussed.
   Description: The core eating disorder psychopathology of anorexia
   nervosa becomes a coping mechanism likely via vulnerable neurobiological
   features and conditioned learning to deal with life events. Thus it is
   reinforcing and ego syntonic resulting in resistance to treatment. The
   severity of core features such as preoccupations with body image,
   weight, eating and exercising predicts greater resistance to treatment.
   Bulimia nervosa patients are less resistant to treatment with treatment
   failure related to greater body image concerns, impulsivity, depression,
   severe diet restriction and poor social adjustment. For those with binge
   eating disorder overweight in childhood and high emotional eating
   predicts treatment resistance. There is suggestive data that a diagnosis
   of an anxiety disorder and severe perfectionism may confer treatment
   resistance in anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders or
   personality disorders with impulse control problems may produce
   resistance to treatment in bulimia nervosa. Traits such as
   perfectionism, cognitive inflexibility and negative affect with likely
   genetic influences may also affect treatment resistance. Pharmacotherapy
   and novel therapies have been developed to address treatment resistance.
   Atypical antipsychotic drugs have shown some effect in treatment
   resistant anorexia nervosa and topiramate and high doses of SSRIs are
   helpful for treatment of resistant binge eating disorder patients. There
   are insufficient randomized controlled trials to evaluate the novel
   psychotherapies which are primarily based on the core psychopathological
   features of the eating disorders.
   Conclusion: Treatment resistance in eating disorders is usually
   predicted by the severity of the core eating disorder psychopathology
   which develops from an interaction between environmental risk factors
   with genetic traits and a vulnerable neurobiology. Future investigations
   of the biological features and neurocircuitry of the core eating
   disorders psychopathology and behaviors may provide information for more
   successful treatment interventions.}},

Title = {{Modelling Parasite Transmission in a Grazing System: The Importance of
   Host Behaviour and Immunity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Parasitic helminths present one of the most pervasive challenges to
   grazing herbivores. Many macro-parasite transmission models focus on
   host physiological defence strategies, omitting more complex
   interactions between hosts and their environments. This work represents
   the first model that integrates both the behavioural and physiological
   elements of gastro-intestinal nematode transmission dynamics in a
   managed grazing system. A spatially explicit, individual-based,
   stochastic model is developed, that incorporates both the hosts'
   immunological responses to parasitism, and key grazing behaviours
   including faecal avoidance. The results demonstrate that grazing
   behaviour affects both the timing and intensity of parasite outbreaks,
   through generating spatial heterogeneity in parasite risk and
   nutritional resources, and changing the timing of exposure to the
   parasites' free-living stages. The influence of grazing behaviour varies
   with the host-parasite combination, dependent on the development times
   of different parasite species and variations in host immune response.
   Our outputs include the counterintuitive finding that under certain
   conditions perceived parasite avoidance behaviours (faecal avoidance)
   can increase parasite risk, for certain host-parasite combinations.
   Through incorporating the two-way interaction between infection dynamics
   and grazing behaviour, the potential benefits of parasite-induced
   anorexia are also demonstrated. Hosts with phenotypic plasticity in
   grazing behaviour, that make grazing decisions dependent on current
   parasite burden, can reduce infection with minimal loss of intake over
   the grazing season. This paper explores how both host behaviours and
   immunity influence macro-parasite transmission in a spatially and
   temporally heterogeneous environment. The magnitude and timing of
   parasite outbreaks is influenced by host immunity and behaviour, and the
   interactions between them; the incorporation of both regulatory
   processes is required to fully understand transmission dynamics.
   Understanding of both physiological and behavioural defence strategies
   will aid the development of novel approaches for control.}},

Abstract = {{Food and water resources are limiting factors for animals in desert
   ecosystems. Fleshy fruits are a rare water source in deserts and when
   available they tend to attract a wide variety of organisms. Here we show
   that two congeneric rodent species, Acomys cahirinus and A. russatus,
   employ different fruit eating strategies that result in either dispersal
   or predation of the small seeds of the desert plant Ochradenus baccatus.
   The nocturnal A. cahirinus leaves intact seeds when consuming O.
   baccatus fruits and thus, acts mainly as a seed disperser; whereas the
   diurnal A. russatus consumes the whole fruit and digests the seeds and
   thus, acts mainly as a seed predator. Acomys russatus is subjected to
   the toxic products of the glucosinolates-myrosinase system found in O.
   baccatus fruits. Acomys cahirinus avoids the toxic compounds by
   consuming the pulp only, which contains glucosinolates but not the seeds
   that contain the enzyme that activates them. We suggest that the

   physiological adaptations to whole fruit consumption that are absent in

Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how animals allocate their foraging time is a central
   question in behavioural ecology. Intrinsic factors, such as body mass
   and size differences between sexes or species, influence animals'
   foraging behaviour, but studies investigating the effects of individual
   differences in body mass and size within the same sex are scarce. We
   investigated this in chick-rearing masked boobies Sula dactylatra, a
   species with reversed sexual dimorphism, through the simultaneous
   deployment of GPS and depth-acceleration loggers to obtain information
   on foraging movements and activity patterns. Heavier females performed
   shorter trips closer to the colony than lighter females. During these
   shorter trips, heavier females spent higher proportions of their flight
   time flapping and less time resting on the water than lighter females
   did during longer trips. In contrast, body mass did not affect trip
   duration of males, however heavier males spent less time flapping and
   more time resting on the water than lighter males. This may occur as a
   result of higher flight costs associated with body mass and allow
   conservation of energy during locomotion. Body size (i.e. wing length)
   had no effect on any of the foraging parameters. Dive depths and dive
   rates (dives h(-1)) were not affected by body mass, but females dived
   significantly deeper than males, suggesting that other factors are
   important. Other studies demonstrated that females are the parent in
   charge of provisioning the chick, and maintain a flexible investment
   under regulation of their own body mass. Variation in trip length
   therefore seems to be triggered by body condition in females, but not in
   males. Consequently, shorter trips are presumably used to provision the
   chick, while longer trips are for self-maintenance. Our findings
   underline the importance of accounting for the effects of body mass
   differences within the same sex, if sex-specific foraging parameters in
   dimorphic species are being investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in how individuals invest in acquiring information (sampling)
   and in insuring themselves against potential negative consequences of
   uncertainty (e.g., by storing energy reserves) has been suggested to
   underlie consistent individual differences in suites of behavioral
   traits. However, the key drivers of individual differences in
   information use remain poorly understood. We use dynamic programming to
   explore how existing variation in metabolic rates (MRs) affects the use
   of sampling and insurance under starvation risk. Our analysis reveals
   nonlinear effects of MRs on diurnal patterns of sampling and insurance.
   Individuals with low MRs accrue reserves quickly, because they invest in
   sampling and are able to exploit profitable options when they arise.
   Individuals with intermediate MRs initially lose reserves, because
   sampling, while optimal, is relatively expensive; however, they later
   build reserves due to efficient exploitation of alternative foraging
   options. Sampling rarely pays for individuals with the highest MRs,
   which show relatively constant levels of energy reserves throughout the
   foraging period. Thus, individual variation in MRs on the scale observed
   in natural populations can lead to important differences in investment
   in sampling and insurance and may underpin consistent individual
   differences in suites of other behavioral traits, including individual
   differences in behavioral responsiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Winter ice conditions in boreal streams are highly variable, and

   ice. This potentially favourable effect of ice cover was tested by
   observing ventilation rates of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a
   laboratory stream at dawn, during the day and at night in the presence
   and absence of real, light-permeable surface ice. Further, we offered
   trout drifting prey during daylight to test whether ice cover increased
   daytime foraging activity. Ice cover reduced ventilation rates during
   the day, but not at night or dawn. Moreover, fish made more daytime

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: In chicken, oils in the maternal diet confer a specific
   scent to the yolk. Embryos are known to perceive and memorize
   chemosensory signals of the surrounding environment; however, the
   potential impact of the maternal diet has not previously been
   investigated. In the present study, we hypothesized that chicken embryos
   memorize the chemical signals of the maternal diet and that this
   perceptual learning may orient subsequent feeding behavior of the
   hatchlings.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Laying hens were fed standard food
   enriched with 2\% menhaden oil (MH group) or 2\% soybean oil (controls).
   The scent of menhaden was significantly more detected in MH egg yolks
   than in control yolks by a human panel. We analyzed the development and
   behavior of offspring towards different types of food, bearing or not
   bearing the menhaden scent. When chicks were exposed to a 3-min choice
   test between the familiar food bearing the menhaden scent and the
   familiar food without menhaden, no effect of treatment was observed. In
   a 3-min choice test with unfamiliar food (mashed cereals) MH chicks
   showed a clear positive orientation toward the unfamiliar food bearing
   the menhaden scent. By contrast, control chicks showed a preference for
   the non-odorized unfamiliar food. MH chicks expressed higher emotional
   reactivity level than control chicks as expressed by food neophobia and
   longer immobility in a restraint test.
   Conclusion/Significance: Chicks exposed in ovo to menhaden oil via the
   maternal diet preferentially oriented their feeding behavior towards
   food containing menhaden oil, but only when the food was unfamiliar. We
   propose that oil in the maternal diet engenders maternal effects and
   contributes to the development of behavioral phenotype in the offspring.
   In ovo chemosensory learning may have evolved to prepare precocial
   offspring for their environment. This suggests a common principle of
   embryonic chemosensory learning across vertebrate taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural strategies to reduce predation risk can incur costs, which
   are often referred to as risk effects. A common strategy to avoid
   predation is spatio-temporal avoidance of predators, in which prey
   typically trade optimal resources for safety. Analogous with
   predator-prey theory, risk effects should also arise in species with
   sexually selected infanticide (SSI), in which females with dependent
   offspring avoid infanticidal males. SSI can be common in brown bear
   (Ursus arctos) populations and explains spatio-temporal segregation
   among reproductive classes. Here, we show that in a population with SSI,
   females with cubs-of-the-year had lower quality diets than conspecifics
   during the SSI high-risk period, the mating season. After the mating
   season, their diets were of similar quality to diets of their
   conspecifics. Our results suggest a nutritive risk effect of SSI, in
   which females with cubs-of-the-year alter their resource selection and
   trade optimal resources for offspring safety. Such risk effects can add
   to female costs of reproduction and may be widespread among species with
   SSI.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is mainly attributed to environmental factors. In
   developed countries, the time spent on physical activity tasks is
   decreasing, whereas sedentary behaviour patterns are increasing. The
   purpose of the intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness of an
   intensive family-based behavioural multicomponent intervention (Nereu
   programme) and compared it to counselling intervention such as a health
   centre intervention programme for the management of children's obesity.
   Methods/Design: The study design is a randomized controlled multicenter
   clinical trial using two types of interventions: Nereu and Counselling.
   The Nereu programme is an 8-month intensive family-based multi-component
   behavioural intervention. This programme is based on a multidisciplinary
   intervention consisting of 4 components: physical activity sessions for
   children, family theoretical and practical sessions for parents,
   behaviour strategy sessions involving both, parents and children, and
   lastly, weekend extra activities for all. Counselling is offered to the
   family in the form of a monthly physical health and eating habits
   session. Participants will be recruited according the following
   criteria: 6 to 12 year-old-children, referred from their paediatricians
   due to overweight or obesity according the International Obesity Task
   Force criteria and with a sedentary profile (less than 2 hours per week
   of physical activity), they must live in or near the municipality of
   Lleida (Spain) and their healthcare paediatric unit must have previously
   accepted to cooperate with this study. The following variables will be
   evaluated: a) cardiovascular risk factors (anthropometric parameters,
   blood test and blood pressure), b) sedentary and physical activity
   behaviour and dietary intake, c) psychological aspects d) health related
   quality of life (HRQOL), e) cost-effectiveness of the intervention in
   relation to HRQOL. These variables will be then be evaluated 4 times
   longitudinally: at baseline, at the end of the intervention (8 months

Title = {{Physiological, Behavioral and Maternal Factors That Contribute to Size
   Variation in Larval Amphibian Populations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Size variance among similarly aged individuals within populations is a
   pattern common to many organisms that is a result of interactions
   between intrinsic and extrinsic traits of individuals. While genetic and
   maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have
   been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations,
   teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates
   remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these
   interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also
   requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the
   relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors,
   neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and
   metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel
   experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions,
   hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and
   maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development
   in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within
   experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was
   associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food
   restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage
   among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a
   role in regulating differing within-population growth trajectories in
   response to density-dependent conditions. Taken together these findings
   suggest that factors that influence hatching conditions can have
   long-term effects on growth and development. These results also raise
   compelling questions regarding the extent to which maternal and genetic
   factors influence physiological and behavioral profiles in amphibians.}},

Title = {{CCK response in bulimia nervosa and following remission}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{56-61}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{The core defining features of bulimia nervosa (BN) are repeated binge
   eating episodes and inappropriate compensatory (e.g., purging) behavior.
   Previous studies suggest an abnormal post-prandial response in the
   satiety-signaling peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) in persons with BN. It
   is unknown whether this altered response persists following remission or
   if it may be a potential target for the development of clinical
   treatment strategies. To examine the nature of this altered response,
   this study assessed whether CCK normalizes following remission from BN
   (RBN). This study prospectively evaluated the plasma CCK response and
   corresponding eating behavior-related ratings (e.g., satiety, fullness,
   hunger, urge to binge and vomit) in individuals with BN-purging subtype
   (n = 10), RBN-purging subtype (n = 14), and healthy controls (CON, n =
   13) at baseline, +15, +30, and +60 min following the ingestion of a
   standardized liquid test meal.
   Subject groups did not significantly differ in CCK response to the test
   meal. A significant relationship between CCK response and satiety
   ratings was observed in the RBN group (r = .59, p < .05 two-tailed). A
   new and unanticipated finding in the BN group was a significant
   relationship between CCK response and ratings of ``urge to vomit{''} (r
   = .86, p < .01, two-tailed).
   Unlike previous investigations, CCK response did not differ in BN and
   CON groups. Thus the role of symptom severity remains an area of further
   investigation. Additionally, findings suggest that in this sample, CCK
   functioning following remission from BN-purging subtype is not different
   from controls. It remains unknown whether or not CCK functioning may be
   a protective or liability factor in the stabilization and recovery
   process. Replication studies utilizing a larger sample size are needed
   to further elucidate the role of CCK in recovery from BN and its
   potential target of related novel treatment strategies. (C) 2013

Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{148-157}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates notable examples of sustainable lifestyles in
   relation to food systems. It explores the surprisingly neglected case of
   widely practised and environmentally sustainable food self-provisioning
   in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe. Our argument is rooted in
   qualitative and quantitative data gathered over a seven-year period
   (2005-2011). The research considers the extent of and motivations for
   these practices in Poland and Czechia. The very high rates compared to
   Western Europe and North America have generally been explained in terms
   of an `urban peasantry' meeting essential needs. After reviewing and
   rejecting those accounts we present evidence for these as socially and
   environmentally beneficial practices, and explore how the motivations
   derive from a range of feelings about food, quality, capability and
   family and/or friendship. Rather than relate these practices to temporal
   signals of quality and sustainability in food ('slow' and `fast'), or
   presenting them as `alternative food networks' we suggest that they
   represent `quiet sustainability'. This novel concept summarises
   widespread practices that result in beneficial environmental or social
   outcomes and that do not relate directly or indirectly to market
   transactions, but are not represented by their practitioners as relating
   directly to environmental or sustainability goals. These practices
   represent exuberant, appealing and socially inclusive, but also
   unforced, forms of sustainability. This case further demonstrates the
   severe limitations of decision makers' focus on economics and behaviour
   change, and their neglect of other dimensions of social life and change
   in developing environmental policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Parasites influence colorful ornaments and their behavioral display in
   many animal hosts. Because coloration and display behavior are often
   critical components of communication, variation in these traits may have
   important implications for individual fitness, yet it remains unclear
   whether such traits are signals of quality in many taxa. We investigated
   the association between ectoparasitic mite load and the color and
   behavioral use of the throat fan (dewlap) by male Anolis brevirostris
   lizards. We found that heavily parasitized lizards exhibited lower body
   condition, duller dewlaps, and less frequent dewlap displays than less
   parasitized individuals. Our results thus suggest that highly
   parasitized individuals invest less in both ornamental color and
   behavioral display of that color. Because the two components of the
   signal simultaneously provide information on male quality, this study
   provides novel support for the long-standing hypothesis that colorful
   traits may function as social or sexual signals in reptiles.}},

Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{76-83}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Acute and chronic states of food deprivation result in increased
   sensitivity to a variety of natural reinforcers as well as to drugs of
   abuse. Food deprived animals show increased locomotor activity during
   periods of food deprivation, as well as increased locomotor stimulant
   responses to drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine,
   and ethanol, implying that drugs of abuse act in part on neural systems
   that underlie responses towards food. To determine whether this effect
   extends to an invertebrate, highly genetically tractable animal, the
   locomotor stimulant effects of low dose ethanol were assessed under a
   variety of feeding conditions in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.
   Food deprivation resulted in strain specific increases in
   ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity in most strains tested, although
   elevated baseline activity confounded interpretation in some strains.
   Experiments conducted with Canton S flies found that the effects of food
   deprivation on the locomotor stimulant response to ethanol increased
   with the duration of deprivation, and could be blocked by refeeding the
   flies with standard food or sucrose, but not yeast, immediately prior to
   the ethanol exposure. Life-span extending dietary depletion procedures
   or previous periods of food deprivation did not affect the response to
   ethanol, indicating that only animals in an acutely food deprived state
   are more sensitive to the stimulant effects of ethanol. These results
   suggest that increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of some
   drugs of abuse might reflect an evolutionarily conserved neural
   mechanism that underlies behavioral responses to natural reinforcers and
   drugs of abuse. The identification of this mechanism, and the genes that
   underlie its development and function, will constitute a novel approach
   towards the study of alcohol abuse and dependence. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Habitat selection by ungulates is determined by the quantity, quality

   social structure of guanaco during both dry and wet seasons of 2005-2007
   in an Argentinean desert, where pumas (Puma concolor) are the sole
   predators. Remote sensing data were used to calculate five variables

   guanaco group and for an equivalent number of random controls. Habitat
   use did not differ between types of social groups but differed between
   seasons. Guanacos used less productive and less steep areas during the
   breeding season, irrespective of juvenile:adult ratios in the family
   groups, and larger groups occupied flatter areas. Overall, guanaco
   habitat selection prioritizes reducing predation risk to the extent that
   animals occupy areas offering the minimum productivity capable of

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{733-740}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aposematic prey warn predators of their toxicity using conspicuous
   signals. However, predators regularly include aposematic prey in their
   diets, particularly when they are in a poor energetic state and in need
   of nutrients. We investigated whether or not an environmental factor,
   ambient temperature, could change the energetic state of predators and
   lead to an increased intake of prey that they know to contain toxins. We
   found that European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, increased their
   consumption of mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, prey containing quinine (a
   mild toxin) when the ambient temperature was reduced below their
   thermoneutral zone from 20 degrees C to 6 degrees C. The birds differed
   in their sensitivity to changes in ambient temperature, with heavier
   birds increasing the number of toxic prey they ate more rapidly with
   decreasing temperature compared to birds with lower body mass. This
   could have been the result of their requiring more nutrients at lower
   temperatures or being better able to detoxify quinine. Taken together,
   our results suggest that conspicuous coloration may be more costly at
   lower temperatures, and that aposematic prey may need to invest more in
   chemical defences as temperatures decline. Our study also provides novel
   insights into what factors affect birds' decisions to eat toxic prey,
   and demonstrates that selection pressures acting on prey defences can
   vary with changing temperature across days, seasons, climes, and
   potentially in response to climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The giving-up density (GUD) framework provides a powerful experimental
   approach with a strong theoretical underpinning to quantify foraging
   outcomes in heterogeneous landscapes. Since its inception, the GUD
   approach has been applied successfully to a vast range of foraging
   species and foraging scenarios. However, its application is not simple,
   as anyone who has tried to use it for the first time might attest.
   Limitations of the technique were noted at its conception, yet only the
   artificiality of the patches, the appropriateness of the food resource,
   and the possibility of multiple visiting foragers were identified. Here
   we show the current uses of GUD and outline the practical benefits as
   well as the often overlooked limitations of the technique. We define
   seven major points that need to be addressed when applying this
   methodology: (1) the curvilinearity between harvest rate and energy, (2)
   the energetic state of the forager, (3) the effect of group foraging,
   (4) food quality and substrate properties, (5) the predictability of the
   patch, (6) behavioral traits of the forager, and (7) nontarget species.
   We also suggest how GUD experiments can be enhanced by incorporating
   complementary methods (such as cameras) to better understand the
   foraging processes involved in the GUD itself. We conclude that the
   benefits of using GUD outweigh the costs, but that its limitations
   should not be ignored. Incorporating new methods when using GUD can
   potentially offer novel and important insights into the study of
   foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers of organic food name health motives as an important driver of
   their choice. Interestingly, triggering health motives in food choice is
   exactly the reason why nutrition and health claims have been developed
   for the communication of functional food. Thus, both product concepts
   have similar consumer purchase motives in common. Organic food and
   functional food are, however, often described as contradictory rather
   than complementary in amongst others the concept of health. Functional
   food tends to be perceived as `unnatural' by consumers. So far, it has
   not been researched how consumers react to a combination of both product
   concepts. A realistically designed purchase simulation was conducted
   with 210 organic consumers in Germany. Five organic products in three
   different categories were offered, unobtrusively altered so that they
   showed a nutrition, health or risk reduction claim on two products in
   each choice set. The results show that products with a claim were not
   significantly preferred nor rejected. Occasional organic buyers,
   however, were significantly more likely to choose products with a claim.
   Choice of a product with a claim was determined by whether respondents
   had read the claim and thought it indicated equal or better health
   performance. Among those for which the latter was the case, respondents
   choosing a product with a claim were characterised by being occasional
   organic food buyers and being less sceptical about health-related
   information on products. It can be concluded that nutrition and health
   claims can be beneficial in the marketing of organic products,
   especially when addressing occasional organic consumers. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The easy accessibility of energy-rich palatable food makes it difficult
   to resist food temptation. Drosophila larvae are surrounded by
   sugar-rich food most of their lives, raising the question of how these
   animals modulate food-seeking behaviors in tune with physiological
   needs. Here we describe a circuit mechanism defined by neurons
   expressing tdc2-Gal4 (a tyrosine decarboxylase 2 promoter-directed
   driver) that selectively drives a distinct foraging strategy in
   food-deprived larvae. Stimulation of this otherwise functionally latent
   circuit in tdc2-Gal4 neurons was sufficient to induce exuberant feeding
   of liquid food in fed animals, whereas targeted lesions in a small
   subset of tdc2-Gal4 neurons in the subesophageal ganglion blocked
   hunger-driven increases in the feeding response. Furthermore, regulation
   of feeding rate enhancement by tdc2-Gal4 neurons requires a novel
   signaling mechanism involving the VEGF2-like receptor, octopamine, and
   its receptor. Our findings provide fresh insight for the neurobiology
   and evolution of appetitive motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Dual-process theories of behaviour have been used to suggest
   that vulnerability to depression involves elevated reactivity to
   emotions. This study tests that idea, examining self-reported
   reactivity.
   Design. Comparison between persons with at least one lifetime episode of
   major depressive disorder (lifetime MDD) and those without this
   diagnosis, controlling for symptoms of alcohol use (a potential
   externalizing confound) and current symptoms of depression (a potential
   state-dependent confound).
   Methods. Undergraduates (N = 120) completed a clinical interview to
   diagnose lifetime MDD and a series of self-reports bearing on diverse
   aspects of self-control, including reactivity to emotion. Thirty-four
   people were diagnosed with lifetime MDD; 86 did not meet criteria for
   MDD. The groups were then compared on three factors underlying the
   scales assessing self-control.
   Results. The MDD group had higher scores than controls on the two
   factors that reflect impulsive reactivity to diverse emotions, including
   emotions that are positive in valence. These effects were not explained
   by associations with either externalizing symptoms or current depressive
   symptoms.
   Conclusions. Reflexive reactivity to emotions characterizes depression,
   in addition to some externalizing problems, and it may deserve study as
   a potential trans-diagnostic feature.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroendocrinology of ingestive behavior is a topic central to human
   health, particularly in light of the prevalence of obesity, eating
   disorders, and diabetes. The study of food intake in laboratory rats and
   mice has yielded some useful hypotheses, but there are still many gaps
   in our knowledge. Ingestive behavior is more complex than the
   consummatory act of eating, and decisions about when and how much to eat
   usually take place in the context of potential mating partners,
   competitors, predators, and environmental fluctuations that are not
   present in the laboratory. We emphasize appetitive behaviors, actions
   that bring animals in contact with a goal object, precede consummatory
   behaviors, and provide a window into motivation. Appetitive ingestive
   behaviors are under the control of neural circuits and neuropeptide
   systems that control appetitive sex behaviors and differ from those that
   control consummatory ingestive behaviors. Decreases in the availability
   of oxidizable metabolic fuels enhance the stimulatory effects of
   peripheral hormones on appetitive ingestive behavior and the inhibitory
   effects on appetitive sex behavior, putting a new twist on the notion of
   leptin, insulin, and ghrelin ``resistance.{''} The ratio of hormone
   concentrations to the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels may
   generate a critical signal that schedules conflicting behaviors, e.g.,
   mate searching vs. foraging, food hoarding vs. courtship, and fat
   accumulation vs. parental care. In species representing every vertebrate
   taxa and even in some invertebrates, many putative ``satiety{''} or
   ``hunger{''} hormones function to schedule ingestive behavior in order
   to optimize reproductive success in environments where energy
   availability fluctuates. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To describe parental vaccine decision making behaviors and
   characterize trust in physician advice among parents with varying
   childhood vaccination behaviors.
   METHODS: Between 2008 and 2011, a mixed methods study was conducted with
   parents of children aged < 4 years who were members of Kaiser Permanente
   Colorado health plan. Seven focus groups were conducted with
   vaccine-hesitant parents. On the basis of findings from the focus
   groups, a survey was developed, pilot tested, and mailed to a stratified
   sample of 854 parents who accepted (n = 500), delayed (n = 227), or
   refused (n = 127) vaccinations for one of their children. Survey results
   were analyzed by chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression.
   RESULTS: Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including: 1) the
   vaccine decision-making process begins prenatally, 2) vaccine decision
   making is an evolving process, and 3) there is overall trust in the
   pediatrician but a lack of trust in the information they provided about
   vaccines. The survey response rate was 52\% (n = 443). Parents who
   refused or delayed vaccines were 2 times more likely to report that they
   began thinking about vaccines before their child was born and 8 times
   more likely to report that they constantly reevaluate their vaccine
   decisions than parents who accepted all vaccines. Although parents
   tended to report trusting their pediatrician's advice on nutrition,
   behavior, and the physical examination, they did not believe their
   pediatrician provided ``balanced{''} information on both the benefits
   and risks of vaccination.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for future interventions to
   address parental vaccination concerns. Such interventions may be more
   effective if they are applied early (during pregnancy) and often
   (pregnancy through infancy), and cover both the risks and benefits of
   vaccination.}},

   the influence of its major predator, the backswimmer Anisops wakefieldi
   White. We established a field experiment with various treatments: 1)
   control without predators, 2) free-roaming A. wakefieldi (with one,
   three, or nine A. wakefieldi per container), 3) caged A. wakefieldi
   (empty cage without predators, with one, three, or nine A. wakefieldi in
   each cage, and 4) A. wakefieldi cues (with cues concentrations of one,

   these four experimental treatments and reared in two different
   laboratory conditions: 1) in clean water without any traces of
   predators, or 2) in water with the same treatments as in field. The
   survival rate of Cx. pervigilans was significantly reduced by the
   presence of predators or their cues. Even after a brief exposure to
   waters containing predators or residual cues, the subsequent progeny and
   the ontogeny of the remaining survivors were still affected. The
   percentage of eggs that hatched, and the resulting mosquito population,
   was influenced by the presence of predators or their cues. Our results
   suggest that sublethal effects may be carried by surviving individuals

Abstract = {{Hosteparasite interactions are a key determinant of the population
   dynamics of wild animals, and behaviours that reduce parasite
   transmission and infection may be important for improving host fitness.
   While antiparasite behaviours have been demonstrated in laboratory
   animals and domesticated ungulates, whether these behaviours operate in
   the wild is poorly understood. Therefore, examining antiparasite
   behaviours in natural populations is crucial for understanding their
   ecological significance. In this study, we examined whether two wild
   rodents (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, and deer mice,
   Peromyscus maniculatus), selectively foraged away from conspecific
   faeces or avoided faeces altogether, and whether faecal gastrointestinal
   parasite status affected their behaviour. We also tested whether wild
   mice, when nesting, avoided using material that had previously been used
   by healthy or parasite-infected conspecifics. Our results, in contrast
   to laboratory mouse studies, suggest that wild mice do not demonstrate
   faecal avoidance, selective foraging or selective use of nesting
   material; they preferred being near faeces and did not differentiate
   between faeces from parasitized and uninfected conspecifics. Behavioural
   avoidance to reduce parasite infection may still represent an important
   strategy; however, mice in our study population appeared to favour the
   opportunity to feed and nest over the risks of coming into contact with
   faecal-transmitted parasites. Furthermore, the presence of conspecific
   faeces may actually provide a positive cue of a good foraging or nesting
   location. Ultimately, balancing the trade-off of performing antiparasite
   behaviours to reduce infection with missing an important feeding or
   nesting opportunity may be very different for animals in the wild facing
   complex and stochastic environments. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published on

Abstract = {{Animals depend on reliable sensory information for accurate behavioural
   decisions. For herbivorous insects it is crucial to find host plants for
   feeding and reproduction, and these insects must be able to
   differentiate suitable from unsuitable plants. Volatiles are important
   cues for insect herbivores to assess host plant quality. It has
   previously been shown that female moths of the Egyptian cotton leafworm,
   Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), avoid oviposition on
   damaged cotton Gossypium hirsutum, which may mediated by
   herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Among the HIPVs, some
   volatiles are released following any type of damage while others are
   synthesized de novo and released by the plants only in response to
   herbivore damage. In behavioural experiments we here show that
   oviposition by S. littoralis on undamaged cotton plants was reduced by
   adding volatiles collected from plants with ongoing herbivory. Gas
   chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) recordings
   revealed that antennae of mated S. littoralis females responded to 18
   compounds from a collection of headspace volatiles of damaged cotton
   plants. Among these compounds, a blend of the seven de novo synthesized
   volatile compounds was found to reduce oviposition in S. littoralis on
   undamaged plants under both laboratory and ambient (field) conditions in
   Egypt. Volatile compounds that are not produced de novo by the plants
   did not affect oviposition. Our results show that ovipositing females
   respond specifically to the de novo synthesized volatiles released from
   plants under herbivore attack. We suggest that these volatiles provide
   reliable cues for ovipositing females to detect plants that could
   provide reduced quality food for their offspring and an increased risk
   of competition and predation.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of diseases increases rapidly with age, accompanied by
   progressive deteriorations of physiological functions in organisms.
   Aging-associated diseases are sporadic but mostly inevitable
   complications arising from senescence. Senescence is often considered
   the antithesis of early development, but yet there may be factors and
   mechanisms in common between these two phenomena over the dynamic
   process of aging. The association between early development and
   late-onset disease with advancing age is thought to come from a
   consequence of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one
   genotype can give rise to a range of physiologically and/or
   morphologically adaptive states in response to different environmental
   or genetic perturbations. On the one hand, we hypothesized that the
   future aging process can be predictive based on adaptivity during the
   early developmental period. Modulating the thresholds of adaptive
   plasticity by chemical genetic approaches, we have been investigating
   whether any relationship exists between the regulatory mechanisms that
   function in early development and in senescence using the zebrafish
   (Danio redo), a small freshwater fish and a useful model animal for
   genetic studies. We have successfully conducted experiments to isolate
   zebrafish mutants expressing apparently altered senescence phenotypes
   during embryogenesis ({''}embryonic senescence{''}), subsequently
   showing shortened lifespan in adulthoods. We anticipate that previously
   uncharacterized developmental genes may mediate the aging process and
   play a pivotal role in senescence. On the other hand, unexpected
   senescence-related genes might also be involved in the early
   developmental process and regulation. The ease of manipulation using the
   zebrafish system allows us to conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel
   genes and small molecular compounds that can be linked to the senescence
   phenotype, and thereby facilitates searching for the evolutionary and
   developmental origins of aging invertebrates. This article is part of a

Abstract = {{There are several studies carried out to test the effect of cholestasis
   on memory impairment and anxiolytic-like behaviors. Some previous
   studies have shown that cholestasis alters the activity of opioidergic
   and dopaminergic systems. The aim of the present study is however to
   investigate the role of mu opioid, D-1 and D-2 dopamine ventral
   hippocampal (CA(3)) receptors upon cholestasis-induced anxiolytic-like
   behaviors in hole board task. Male mice weighing 25-30 g were used.
   Cholestasis was induced by ligation of the main bile duct. Our data
   indicated that cholestasis can induce anxiolytic-like response.
   Furthermore, the results showed that the intra-CA(3) injection of
   naloxone, a mu receptor antagonist at 025 and 0.5 mu g/mouse, SCH23390,
   a D-1 dopamine receptor antagonist or sulpiride, as a D-2 dopamine
   receptor antagonist, 5 min before testing, reversed the
   cholestasis-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors seven days after bile duct
   ligation (BDL). Unlike the higher dose of SCH23390 (0.5 mu g/mouse)
   which induced anxiogenic-like behaviors, other doses of the above drugs
   did not alter the exploratory behaviors in examined mice. Based on our
   findings, co-administration of the subthreshold dose of naloxone (0.125
   mu g/mouse), SCH23390 or sulpiride, and SCH23390 with sulpiride, neither
   altered exploratory behaviors in animals nor reversed the
   cholestasis-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors, seven days post BDL.
   Current results demonstrated firstly, the anxiolytic-like behaviors are
   evident in cholestatic mice seven days post BDL; secondly, there are
   plausible mechanisms governing the involvement of the CA(3) opioidergic
   and dopaminergic systems in this phenomenon and thirdly, there seem to
   be no interaction between these systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{How foragers balance risks during foraging is a central focus of optimal
   foraging studies. While diverse theoretical and empirical work has
   revealed how foragers should and do manage food and safety from
   predators, little attention has been given to the risks posed by
   dangerous prey. This is a potentially important oversight because risk
   of injury can give rise to foraging costs similar to those arising from
   the risk of predation, and with similar consequences. Here, we
   synthesize the literature on how foragers manage risks associated with
   dangerous prey and adapt previous theory to make the first steps towards
   a framework for future studies. Though rarely documented, it appears
   that in some systems predators are frequently injured while hunting and
   risk of injury can be an important foraging cost. Fitness costs of
   foraging injuries, which can be fatal, likely vary widely but have
   rarely been studied and should be the subject of future research. Like
   other types of risk-taking behaviour, it appears that there is
   individual variation in the willingness to take risks, which can be
   driven by social factors, experience and foraging abilities, or
   differences in body condition. Because of ongoing modifications to
   natural communities, including changes in prey availability and relative

Abstract = {{Prolonged exposure to stress during development can have long-term
   detrimental effects on health and wellbeing. However, the environmental
   matching hypothesis proposes that developmental stress programs
   physiology and behaviour in an adaptive way that can enhance fitness if
   early environments match those experienced later in life. Most research
   has focused on the harmful effects that stress during a single period in
   early life may exert in adulthood. In this study, we tested the
   potential additive and beneficial effects that stress experienced during
   both pre- and post-hatching development may have on adult physiology and
   behaviour. Japanese quail experienced different stress-related
   treatments across two developmental life stages: pre-hatching
   corticosterone (CORT) injection, post-hatching unpredictable food
   availability, both pre- and post-hatching treatments, or control. In
   adulthood, we determined quails' acute stress response, neophobia and
   novel environment exploration. The pre-hatching CORT treatment resulted
   in attenuated physiological responses to an acute stressor, increased
   activity levels and exploration in a novel environment. Post-hatching
   unpredictable food availability decreased adults' latency to feed.
   Furthermore, there were cumulative effects of these treatments across
   the two developmental stages: quail subjected to both pre- and
   post-hatching treatments were the most explorative and risk-taking of
   all treatment groups. Such responses to novel environments could enhance
   survival in unpredictable environments in later life. Our data also
   suggest that these behavioural responses may have been mediated by
   long-term physiological programming of the adrenocortical stress
   response, creating phenotypes that could exhibit fitness-enhancing
   behaviours in a changing environment. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{It is well established that early-life nutritional alterations lead to
   increased risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in adult life.
   Although it is clear that obesity gives rise to chronic low-grade
   inflammation, there is little evidence regarding the role of
   inflammation in the adipose tissue of undernourished (UN) offspring. GH
   reduces fat mass and has antiinflammatory properties. The present study
   examined the effect of maternal UN on adipose inflammation in adult
   offspring and whether GH treatment during a critical period of
   developmental plasticity could ameliorate metabolic dysfunction
   associated with a poor start to life. Sprague Dawley rats were assigned
   to chow (C) or UN (50\% ad libitum; UN) diet throughout gestation. Male
   C and UN pups received saline (control saline {[}CS]/UN) or GH (2.5 mu
   g/g/d; control growth hormone {[}CGH]/undernourished growth hormone
   {[}UNGH]) from days 3-21. Postweaning males were further randomized and
   fed either chow or high-fat diet until day 160. An ex vivo glucose
   uptake assay demonstrated adipose tissue from UN offspring displayed
   attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake compared with CS, CGH, and
   UNGH. This was associated with increased insulin receptor, glucose

Abstract = {{Control operations for invasive ship rats, Rattus rattus, in New Zealand
   forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus,
   detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is
   intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple
   predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly
   competitive, it should include threat and display features associated
   with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack
   these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two
   captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live
   rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats
   were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display
   characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely
   reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn
   by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or
   unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the
   euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least
   part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the
   aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display
   features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles
   predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the
   interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their
   management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further
   research is required to determine whether the results of our captive
   experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Predators often show strong plasticity of optimal foraging strategies. A
   major difference in foraging strategies occurs between sit-and-wait and
   active predators. Models predict that the efficiency of these strategies
   is affected by environmental conditions, active predators being favoured
   when prey are scarce and their detection difficult. The shift between
   the two strategies may occur through both phenotypic plasticity and
   local adaptations. Larvae of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra,
   are typically stream-dwelling sit-and-wait predators, but some
   populations breed in caves. We evaluated whether local adaptations or
   phenotypic plasticity determine shifts in foraging strategy between
   stream and cave populations. The foraging behaviour of salamander larvae
   was evaluated under all combinations of three test conditions during
   trials: light versus darkness, prey presence versus absence and food
   deprived versus fed; larvae originated from caves and streams and were
   reared in epigeous photoperiod or in darkness. Observations and video
   tracking showed that salamander larvae modified their behaviour in
   response to environmental conditions. In the darkness, larvae showed
   higher average velocity and moved longer distances. Movements were
   higher in food-deprived larvae and in the presence of prey compared to
   fed larvae and prey absent conditions. Furthermore, larvae from cave
   populations showed higher behavioural plasticity than stream larvae, and
   better exploited the available space in test environments. Variation in
   foraging behaviour was strong, and involved complex interactions between
   plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae from cave populations showed
   higher behavioural plasticity, supporting the hypothesis that this trait
   may be important for the exploitation of novel environments, such as
   caves. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Foraging behaviour (grazing time, diet selection) and overlap in
   vegetation use between five beef cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 does,
   suckling their offspring born in late winter-early spring, was compared
   across the grazing season (May-December). Animals were managed in mixed
   grazing on heather-gorse vegetation communities with an adjacent area
   (24\%) of ryegrass-clover improved pasture. Equines spent more daily
   time grazing than the other species in all seasons, averaging 610
   min/day compared to 530, 481 and 496 min/day spent by cattle, sheep and
   goats, respectively. Seasonal changes in both grazing behaviour and diet
   selection were observed. Generally, cows, mares and ewes spent most of
   their grazing time on the improved pasture (0.77, 0.73 and 0.59,
   respectively), whereas goats spent more time grazing on shrublands
   (0.70). All species concentrated their diurnal grazing activity in the
   morning and late afternoon, whilst resting occurred mainly in the middle
   of the day. Herbaceous species were the main component in the diets of
   cattle, equines and sheep across the whole grazing season, whereas for
   goats this predominance was only observed during the spring. Cattle,
   sheep and equines turned to browse only when pasture availability
   decreased. Cattle and sheep tended to select heather in moderate amounts
   whereas they avoided gorse across the grazing season. By contrast,
   horses seemed to be able to deal with the gorse spiny shoots and
   consumed it in the autumn (averaging 0.29). The goats' diet at the end
   of the grazing season was mainly composed of heather species, reaching
   0.81 in November. Degree of grazing overlap between livestock species
   was influenced by the animal species and also varied across the grazing
   season. The greatest similarity indexes (KSI) based on grazing time and
   diet composition data were found between cattle and equines (0.86) and
   between cattle and sheep (0.94), whereas the combination of goats with
   the other animal species resulted in lower KSI values. Dietary overlap
   decreased as the improved pasture availability decreased during the
   grazing season. Results suggest that the success of management
   strategies (type and composition of the flock, mixed or sequential,
   continuous or seasonal) in these heterogeneous vegetation conditions
   will depend on plant species characteristics and its proportions.
   Grazing management options should be based on production (animal
   performance) or environmental goals (biodiversity, control of shrub
   encroachment, reduction of fire risk, etc.) previously defined. Goats
   proved to be the best complement to the other animal species for an
   efficient use of natural vegetation. Nevertheless, studies should be
   carried out to assess the interactions between grazing behaviour and
   animal performance in these particular vegetation conditions. (C) 2013

   average phenotypes for body size, shape and life history (freshwater
   populations with smaller body size, lower fecundity and larger
   reproductive allotment). Pregnant females were brought to the lab and
   the offspring from both groups were kept in a common recirculating

   differences due to mortality and maternal effects (offspring size) were

   The results are consistent with phenotypic differences among populations

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Body size at metamorphosis is a key trait in species (such as many
   anurans) with biphasic life-histories. Experimental studies have shown
   that metamorph size is highly plastic, depending upon larval density and
   environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, food supply, water quality,
   chemical cues from conspecifics, predators and competitors). To test the
   hypothesis that this developmental plasticity is adaptive, or to
   determine if inducing plasticity can be used to control an invasive
   species, we need to know whether or not a metamorphosing anuran's body
   size influences its subsequent viability. For logistical reasons, there
   are few data on this topic under field conditions. We studied cane toads
   (Rhinella marina) within their invasive Australian range. Metamorph body
   size is highly plastic in this species, and our laboratory studies
   showed that larger metamorphs had better locomotor performance (both on
   land and in the water), and were more adept at catching and consuming
   prey. In mark-recapture trials in outdoor enclosures, larger body size
   enhanced metamorph survival and growth rate under some seasonal
   conditions. Larger metamorphs maintained their size advantage over
   smaller siblings for at least a month. Our data support the critical but
   rarely-tested assumption that all else being equal, larger body size at
   metamorphosis is likely to enhance an individual's long term viability.
   Thus, manipulations to reduce body size at metamorphosis in cane toads
   may help to reduce the ecological impact of this invasive species.}},

   behaviour change in individuals with high cardiovascular risk}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Management of cardiovascular risk factors includes
   commitment from patients to adhere to prescribed medications and adopt
   healthy lifestyles. Unfortunately many fail to take up and maintain the
   four key healthy behaviours (not smoking, having a balanced diet,
   limiting alcohol consumption and being more active). Five factors
   (beliefs, knowledge, transport and other costs, emotions, and friends
   and family support) are known to predict uptake of lifestyle behaviour
   change. The key factors influencing maintenance of healthy lifestyles
   are not known but would be helpful to support the development of relapse
   prevention programmes for this population. Our review aimed to clarify
   the main patient perceived factors thought to influence maintenance of
   changed healthy lifestyles.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of qualitative observational
   studies and applied the principles of content synthesis and thematic
   analysis to extract reported factors (barriers and facilitators)
   considered by individuals to be influential in maintaining changed
   healthy lifestyle behaviours. Factors were then organised into an
   existing framework of higher order categories which was followed by an
   analysis of the interrelationships between factors to identify key
   themes.
   Results: Twenty two studies met our inclusion criteria. Participants
   reported barriers and facilitators within 13 categories, the majority of
   which were facilitators. The most commonly reported influences were
   those relating to social support (whether provided formally or
   informally), beliefs (about the self or the causes and management of
   poor health, and the value of maintaining lifestyle behaviours), and
   other psychological factors (including attitude, thinking and coping
   styles, and problem solving skills). Physical activity was the most
   commonly investigated behaviour in four categories, but overall, the
   main barriers and facilitators were related to a range of behaviours.
   Through analysis of the interrelationships between factors within
   categories, `social support', `education and knowledge', and `beliefs
   and emotions' were all considered key themes.
   Conclusions: Our review suggests that for the most part, factors that
   influence lifestyle change are also important for maintaining healthy
   behaviours. This indicates that addressing these barriers and
   facilitators within lifestyle support programmes would also be of value
   in the longer-term.}},

Abstract = {{High mortality in rearing of domestic rabbits is not only an economic
   problem but also an animal welfare issue. Among the reasons for this
   high mortality are some common rearing practices. In this review, we
   point out several commonly used management practices, which neither
   represent adequate housing conditions according to the animals'
   behavioural requirements nor correspond to their nutritional needs.
   Sometimes, the doe has to build the nursery nest on the cage floor or in
   a box with a permanently open entrance, often not protected from the
   light. This can lead to perinatal mortality due to disturbed behaviour
   of the mother such as failure to build a proper nest, depositing the
   kits outside the nest, or infanticide. Furthermore, continuous housing
   of the doe with the kits does not conform to this species' pattern of
   unusually limited maternal care. Possibly stimulated by olfactory and
   acoustic signals emanating from the nest, the doe can disturb the
   inactivity of the kits by her frequent entries to the nest or attempts
   to close the entrance. Cooling of the kits caused by maladaptive
   maternal behaviour under such conditions can also contribute to
   increased mortality and morbidity during the nursing period. In
   addition, when the doe is left to nurse the kits longer than four weeks,
   which does not conform to the reproductive biology of the rabbit, kit
   morbidity can be increased by the following factors. Although the doe's
   milk has a high protective role against main digestive disorders,
   prolonged mother-offspring contact might increase the risk of the kits
   becoming infected with pathogens such as coccidiosis, EPEC and
   pasteurellosis persisting in the doe. Pre-disposition of the kits to
   bacterial enteropathies can be encouraged by the delayed development of
   the enzymatic system, the delayed establishment of a stable gut flora,
   as well as by consumption of the doe's feed. The increased energy
   demands of lactation as well as mastitis incidence due to prolonged
   suckling by the kits could decrease the fertility and the lifespan of
   the doe. Feed with a high content of non-fibre carbohydrates (compared
   to green forage) can promote bacterial enteropathies when given before
   the development of the kits' digestive functions is completed. The risk
   of the outbreak of such diseases is enhanced by intestinal coccidiosis
   and unstable gut flora. Enteropathies are also exacerbated by the use of
   deep litter as opposed to housing rabbits on perforated floors.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic noise has the potential to cause stress, to distract and to
   mask important sounds, and thus to affect behaviour. Human activities
   have added considerable noise to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats,
   and there is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise affects
   communication and movement patterns in a variety of species. However,
   there has been relatively little work considering the effect on
   behaviours that are fundamental to survival, and thus have direct
   fitness consequences. We conducted a series of controlled tank-based
   experiments to consider how playback of ship noise, the most common
   source of underwater noise, affects foraging and antipredator behaviour
   in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ship noise playback was more likely
   than ambient-noise playback to disrupt feeding, although crabs
   experiencing the two sound treatments did not differ in their likelihood
   of, or speed at, finding a food source in the first place. While crabs
   exposed to ship noise playback were just as likely as ambient-noise
   controls to detect and respond to a simulated predatory attack, they
   were slower to retreat to shelter. Ship noise playback also resulted in
   crabs that had been turned on their backs righting themselves faster
   than those experiencing ambient-noise playback; remaining immobile may
   reduce the likelihood of further predatory attention. Our findings
   therefore suggest that anthropogenic noise has the potential to increase
   the risks of starvation and predation, and showcases that the behaviour
   of invertebrates, and not just vertebrates, is susceptible to the impact
   of this pervasive global pollutant. (C) 2013 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Social groups balance flexibility and robustness in their collective
   response to environmental changes using feedback between behavioural
   processes that operate at different timescales. Here we examine how
   behavioural processes operating at two timescales regulate the foraging
   activity of colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus,
   allowing them to balance their response to food availability and
   predation. Previous work showed that the rate at which foragers return
   to the nest with food influences the rate at which foragers leave the
   nest. To investigate how interactions inside the nest link the rates of
   returning and outgoing foragers, we observed outgoing foragers inside
   the nest in field colonies using a novel observation method. We found
   that the interaction rate experienced by outgoing foragers inside the
   nest corresponded to forager return rate, and that the interactions of
   outgoing foragers were spatially clustered. Activation of a forager
   occurred on the timescale of seconds: a forager left the nest 3-8 s
   after a substantial increase in interactions with returning foragers.
   The availability of outgoing foragers to become activated was adjusted
   on the timescale of minutes: when forager return was interrupted for
   more than 4-5 min, available foragers waiting near the nest entrance
   went deeper into the nest. Thus, forager activation and forager
   availability both increased with the rate at which foragers returned to
   the nest. This process was checked by negative feedback between forager
   activation and forager availability. Regulation of foraging activation
   on the timescale of seconds provides flexibility in response to
   fluctuations in food abundance, whereas regulation of forager
   availability on the timescale of minutes provides robustness in response
   to sustained disturbance such as predation. (C) 2013 The Association for

   other. Young animals look out for parents' arrival in order to start
   begging as quickly as possible, since a rapid begging reaction increases
   the likelihood of being fed before nestmates. If the young can
   physically intercept the parents, selection might be operating on the
   offspring ability to monitor parent arrival (vigilance towards parents)
   and any sudden modifications in siblings' behaviour (vigilance towards
   siblings). To investigate the adaptive value of nestling vigilance in
   the context of family interactions, we recorded which direction barn owl
   Tyto alba siblings were facing in 89 two-chick broods before the first
   parental feeding visit of the night. Nestlings were more vigilant
   towards nest entrance than expected by chance suggesting that vigilance
   towards parents is an important component of sibling competition. When
   positioned near the nest-box entrance where parents predictably deliver
   food, the younger individual (i.e. junior) looked more towards the
   entrance than its older sibling. Thus, when the likelihood of obtaining
   a food item is relatively high, juniors are more vigilant than seniors
   to detect the incoming parent. When positioned at the back of the nest,
   the senior looked relatively more frequently towards its sibling than
   the junior did in the same situation. This suggests that when the
   likelihood of obtaining a food item is relatively low, seniors are more
   vigilant than juniors to observe their sibling. Because vigilance was
   not related to hunger level and prey obtaining, we propose the
   hypothesis that vigilance towards parents and siblings only indirectly
   influences the outcome of sibling competition.}},

Abstract = {{Immune function can be modulated by multiple physiological factors,
   including nutrition and reproductive state. Because these factors can
   vary throughout an individual's lifetime as a result of environmental
   conditions (affecting nutrition) or life-history stage (e. g. entering
   the adult reproduction stage), we must carefully examine the degree to
   which developmental versus adult conditions shape performance of the
   immune system. We investigated how variation in dietary access to
   carotenoid pigments - a class of molecules with immunostimulatory
   properties that females deposit into egg yolks - during three different
   developmental time points affected adult immunological and reproductive
   traits in female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In males and
   females of other avian species, carotenoid access during development
   affects carotenoid assimilation ability, adult sexual ornamentation and
   immune function, while carotenoid access during adulthood can increase
   immune response and reproductive investment (e. g. egg-laying capacity,
   biliverdin deposition in eggshells). We failed to detect effects of
   developmental carotenoid supplementation on adult immune function
   {[}phytohemagglutinin-induced cutaneous immune response, antibody
   production in response to the novel antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin
   (KLH), or oxidative burst, assessed by changes in circulating nitric
   oxide levels], carotenoid-pigmented beak coloration, ovarian
   development, circulating carotenoid levels or concentration of bile
   pigments in the gall bladder. However, we did uncover positive
   relationships between circulating carotenoid levels during adulthood and
   KLH-specific antibody production, and a negative relationship between
   biliverdin concentration in bile and KLH-specific antibody production.
   These results are consistent with the view that adult physiological
   parameters better predict current immune function than do developmental
   conditions, and highlight a possible, previously unstudied relationship
   between biliverdin and immune system performance.}},

Abstract = {{Animals modify their foraging strategies in response to environmental
   changes that affect foraging performance. In some species, cleptobiosis
   represents an alternative strategy for resource access. The
   environmental factors that favor the incidence or prevalence of

   Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum is characterized by a high frequency of

   which specialized thief workers insinuate themselves into nests of
   neighboring colonies and intercept food items brought into these nests.
   Here, we evaluate how colonies adjust thievery behavior in response to
   food availability. We supplemented food availability and measured how
   the incidence and intensity of thievery responded to resource
   availability. We found that the incidence and intensity of thievery
   decline in response to supplemental food, suggesting that thievery
   behavior is a response to resource limitation at the population scale.
   This finding indicates that the phenomenon of intraspecific thievery,

Abstract = {{Background Ingestion of sweet food is driven by central reward circuits
   and restrained by endocrine and neurocrine satiety signals. The specific
   influence of sucrose intake on central affective and reward circuitry
   and alterations of these mechanisms in the obese are incompletely
   understood. For this, we hypothesized that (i) similar brain regions are
   engaged by the stimulation of sweet taste receptors by sucrose and by
   non-nutrient sweeteners and (ii) during visual food-related cues, obese
   subjects show greater brain responses to sucrose compared with lean
   controls. Methods In a double-blind, crossover design, 10 obese and 10
   lean healthy females received a sucrose or a non-nutrient sweetened
   beverage prior to viewing food or neutral images. BOLD signal was
   measured using a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. Key Results Viewing food images
   after ingestion of either drink was associated with engagement of
   similar brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, anterior
   insula). Obese differed from lean subjects in behavioral and brain

Abstract = {{The balance between the costs and benefits of conspicuous animal
   communication signals ensures that signal expression relates to the
   quality of the bearer. Signal plasticity enables males to enhance
   conspicuous signals to impress mates and competitors and to reduce
   signal expression to lower energetic and predation-related signaling
   costs when competition is low. While signal plasticity may benefit the
   signaler, it can compromise the reliability of the information conveyed
   by the signals. In this paper we review the effect of signal plasticity
   on the reliability of the electrocommunication signal of the gymnotiform
   fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio. We (1) summarize the endocrine regulation
   of signal plasticity, (2) explore the regulation of signal plasticity in
   females, (3) examine the information conveyed by the signal, (4) show
   how that information changes when the signal changes, and (5) consider
   the energetic strategies used to sustain expensive signaling. The
   electric organ discharge (EOD) of B. gauderio changes in response to
   social environment on two time scales. Two hormone classes,
   melanocortins and androgens, underlie the short-term and long-term
   modulation of signal amplitude and duration observed during social
   interaction. Population density drives signal amplitude enhancement,
   unexpectedly improving the reliability with which the signal predicts
   the signaler's size. The signal's second phase elongation predicts
   androgen levels and male reproductive condition. Males sustain signal
   enhancement with dietary intake, but when food is limited, they `go for
   broke' and put extra energy into electric signals. Cortisol diminishes
   EOD parameters, but energy-limited males offset cortisol effects by
   boosting androgen levels. While physiological constraints are sufficient
   to maintain signal amplitude reliability, phenotypic integration and
   signaling costs maintain reliability of signal duration, consistent with
   theory of honest signaling.}},

Abstract = {{While the eukaryotic genome is the same throughout all somatic cells in
   an organism, there are specific structures and functions that discern
   one type of cell from another. These differences are due to the cell's
   unique gene expression patterns that are determined during cellular
   differentiation. Interestingly, these cell-specific gene expression
   patterns can be affected by an organism's environment throughout its
   lifetime leading to phenotypical changes that have the potential of
   altering risk of some diseases. Both cell-specific gene expression
   signatures and environment mediated changes in expression patterns can
   be explained by a complex network of modifications to the DNA, histone
   proteins and degree of DNA packaging called epigenetic marks. Several
   areas of research have formed to study these epigenetic modifications,
   including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling
   and microRNA (miRNA). The original definition of epigenetics
   incorporates inheritable but reversible phenomena that affect gene
   expression without altering base pairs. Even though not all of the above
   listed epigenetic traits have demonstrated heritability, they can all
   alter gene transcription without modification to the underlying genetic
   sequence. Because these epigenetic patterns can also be affected by an
   organism's environment, they serve as an important bridge between life
   experiences and phenotypes. Epigenetic patterns may change throughout
   one's lifespan, by an early life experience, environmental exposure or
   nutritional status. Epigenetic signatures influenced by the environment
   may determine our appearance, behavior, stress response, disease
   susceptibility, and even longevity. The interaction between types of
   epigenetic modifications in response to environmental factors and how
   environmental cues affect epigenetic patterns will further elucidate how
   gene transcription can be affectively altered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nutritional factors play a life-long role in human health. Indeed, there
   is growing evidence that one of the mechanisms by which nutrients and
   bioactive compounds affect metabolic traits is epigenetics. Complex
   interactions among food components and histone modifications, DNA
   methylation, non-coding RNA expression and chromatin remodeling factors
   lead to a dynamic regulation of gene expression that controls the
   cellular phenotype. Although perinatal period is the time of highest
   phenotypic plasticity, contributing largely to developmental
   programming, also during adulthood there is evidence about a nutritional
   influence on epigenetic regulation. Similarly to type 2 diabetes,
   hypertension, atherosclerosis and other metabolic disorders, obesity
   predisposition and weight loss outcomes have been repeatedly associated
   to changes in epigenetic patterns. Different non-nutritional risk
   factors that usually accompany obesity seem also to be involved in these
   epigenetic modifications, especially hyperglycemia, inflammation,
   hypoxia and oxidative stress. There are currently three major objectives
   in epigenetic research in relation to obesity: to search for epigenetic
   biomarkers to predict future health problems or detect the individuals
   at most risk, to understand the obesity-related environmental factors
   that could modulate gene expression by affecting epigenetic mechanisms,
   and to study novel therapeutic strategies based on nutritional or
   pharmacological agents that can modify epigenetic marks. At this level,
   the major tasks are: development of robust epigenetic biomarkers of
   weight regulation, description of those epigenetic marks more
   susceptible to be modified by dietary exposures, identification of the
   active ingredients (and the doses) that alter the epigenome, assessment
   of the real importance of other obesity-related factors on epigenetic
   regulation, determination of the period of life in which best results
   are obtained, and understanding the importance of the inheritance of
   these epigenetic marks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Because species interactions are often context-dependent, abiotic
   factors such as temperature and biotic factors such as food quality may
   alter species interactions with potential consequences to ecosystem
   structure and function. For example, altered predator-prey interactions
   may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary
   production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a
   plant-grasshopper-spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to
   investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper
   performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic
   interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are
   active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we
   hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled
   treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider
   interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with
   food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced
   grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments,
   but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed
   treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for
   grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite
   significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in
   the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled
   treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest.
   Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an
   understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our
   results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter
   predator-prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for
   ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative
   importance of top-down and bottom-up processes.}},

Abstract = {{Ontogenetic changes in antipredator behavior optimize survival of
   growing animals. Leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) respond to a
   simulated predator either by postural and vocal threats, sometimes
   followed by biting, or alternatively by a rapid escape. The former
   ``confrontational{''} and the latter ``avoidance{''} behavior rarely
   occurs in a sequence; in fact, they represent mutually exclusive
   defensive strategies. We examined 552 individuals of a leopard gecko (E.
   macularius) of various ages, from hatching up to adulthood (31 months).
   Each experimental animal was exposed to a sequence of five
   ``water-spraying{''} and ten ``stick{''} (stick poking on base of the
   tail) stimuli, and the emitted behavior was recorded. We analyzed the
   effects of age, body size, body condition, adult-juvenile coloration,
   and sex on observed behavioral traits. The results showed that in the
   case of water-spraying stimulus, the usage of deterrent vocalization or
   escape tactic was affected by age and condition. In addition to that,
   using deterrent vocalization was influenced by the coloration of the
   animal. Stick stimulus evokes antipredator strategies that correspond
   with age and coloration (deterrent vocalization) and also with
   standardized body size (escape). Thus, leopard geckos exhibit clear
   ontogenetic change of defensive strategies, from
   threat-vocalization-bite strategy prevailing in juveniles to an escape
   strategy typical for adults. This behavioral change is accompanied by
   the ontogenetic switch of coloration from presumably warning contrasting
   light-dark banded pattern of juveniles to a cryptic spotted coloration
   of the adults.}},

Abstract = {{L-Tyrosine can be synthesised in the body from L-phenylalanine, an
   essential amino acid. The additive L-tyrosine is produced by acid
   hydrolysis of feather keratin. L-Tyrosine is considered safe for all
   animal species, provided that the conditions of use are respected, i.e.
   supplementation of conventional diets with 0.5 \% L-tyrosine for
   food-producing animals and 1.5 \% for non-food-producing species. Higher
   dietary concentrations may lead to growth rate depression and eye
   lesions, and, in young animals, behavioural changes. L-Tyrosine will be
   incorporated into the body protein of the animal. The protein
   composition will not be changed. Free L-tyrosine will not be stored in
   the tissues. On the basis of the data available, no risk is expected for
   the consumer from the use of this L-tyrosine preparation showing a
   purity > 95 \%. In the absence of data, the product is considered
   potentially irritating to skin and eyes, a potential dermal sensitiser
   and hazardous by inhalation. The use of L-tyrosine in animal nutrition
   would not be expected to lead to any localised increase in the
   concentration of L-tyrosine or its metabolites in the environment. It is
   concluded that the use of this product as a feed additive does not
   represent a risk to the environment. The supplementation of feed with
   L-tyrosine is efficacious in cases where high requirements for tyrosine
   as a melanin precursor occur. This has been demonstrated in cats for
   intensively colouring the coat. L-Tyrosine may also have the potential
   to intensify the pigmentation of the coat/plumage of other species, but

Abstract = {{We discuss the importance of selected natural abiotic and biotic factors
   in ecological risk assessment based on simplistic laboratory bioassays.
   Although it is impossible to include all possible natural factors in
   standard lower-tier ecotoxicological testing, neglecting them is not an
   option. Therefore, we try to identify the most important factors and
   advocate redesigning standard testing procedures to include
   theoretically most potent interactions. We also point out a few
   potentially important factors that have not been studied enough so far.
   The available data allowed us to identify temperature and O-2 depletion
   as the most critical factors that should be included in ecotoxicity
   testing as soon as possible. Temporal limitations and fluctuations in
   food availability also appear important, but at this point more
   fundamental research in this area is necessary before making decisions
   on their inclusion in risk assessment procedures. We propose using
   specific experimental designs, such as Box-Behnken or Central Composite,
   which allow for simultaneous testing of 3 or more factors for their
   individual and interactive effects with greater precision and without
   increasing the effort and costs of tests dramatically. Factorial design
   can lead to more powerful tests and help to extend the validity of
   conclusions. Finally, ecological risk assessment procedures should

Title = {{Sibling competition and hunger increase allostatic load in spotted
   hyaenas}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Allostatis is the process of maintaining homeostatis through behavioural
   or physiological responses to challenges, and its cumulative energetic
   cost is termed allostatic load. The allostatic load hypothesis predicts
   that hunger and the mechanisms that establish and maintain social
   dominance should have a strong impact on allostatic load. In spotted
   hyaenas, dominance between twin siblings emerges during intense early
   competition for maternal milk and involves trained winner/loser effects.
   Conflict over access to teats declines with age as behavioural dominance
   conventions are established. In young litters, the allostatic load of
   subordinates measured in terms of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite
   concentrations (fGMCs) should be higher than that of dominants. When low
   milk provisioning threatens survival, hungry subordinates are more
   assertive, particularly when competing against a dominant sister.
   Dominants challenged by assertive subordinates should have allostatic
   loads and fGMCs above those of dominants with subordinates that adhere
   to dominance conventions. We show that in young litters, subordinates
   had significantly higher fGMCs than dominants, and dominant sisters had
   significantly higher fGMCs than dominant brothers. When hungry, both
   dominants and subordinates had significantly higher fGMCs than when fed.
   Our results provide evidence that hunger and sibling competition affect
   allostatic load in spotted hyaenas.}},

Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Wildlife is exposed to natural (e.g., food availability and quality,
   parasitism) and anthropogenic stressors (e.g., habitat fragmentation,
   toxicants). Individual variables (e.g., age, gender) affect behaviour
   and physiology of animals. Together, these parameters can create both
   great inter-individual variations in health indicators and
   interpretation difficulties. We investigated the relevance of body
   condition and somatic indices (liver, kidneys) as indicators of health
   status in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus, n= 560) captured along a metal
   pollution gradient in four landscape types (30 sampling squares 500-m
   sided). The indices were calculated using a recently proposed standard
   major axis regression instead of an ordinary least square regression.
   After considering age and gender for the body condition index, no
   landscape type influence was detected in the indices. However, important
   index variability was observed between sampling squares; this effect was
   included as a random effect in linear models. After integrating all
   individual and environmental variables that may affect the indices,
   cadmium (Cd) concentrations in both the liver and kidneys were
   negatively related to body condition and liver indices only for
   individuals from highly contaminated sites. Lead in the liver was
   negatively related to the liver index, and Cd in kidneys was positively
   linked to the kidney index, potentially suggesting metal-induced stress.
   However, interpretation of these indices as a wildlife ecotoxicology
   tool should be performed with caution due to the sensitivity of
   potentially confounding variables (e.g., individual factors and
   environmental parameters).}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Predation, predation risk, and resource quality affect suites of prey
   traits that collectively impact individual fitness, population dynamics,
   and community structure. However, studies of multitrophic level effects
   generally focus on a single prey trait, failing to capture trade-offs
   among suites of covarying traits that govern population responses and
   emergent community patterns. We used structural equation models (SEM) to
   summarize the non-lethal and lethal effects of crayfish, Procambarus
   fallax, and phosphorus (P) addition, which affected prey food quality
   (periphyton), on the interactive effects of behavioral, morphological,
   developmental, and reproductive traits of snails, Planorbella duryi.
   Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested trade-offs between
   production (growth, reproduction) and defense (foraging behavior, shell
   shape) traits of snails in response to non-lethal crayfish and P
   addition, but few lethal effects. SEM revealed that non-lethal crayfish
   effects indirectly limited per capita offspring standing stock by
   increasing refuge use, slowing individual growth, and inducing snails to
   produce thicker, compressed shells. The negative effects of non-lethal
   crayfish on snails were strongest with P addition; snails increased
   allocation to shell defense rather than growth or reproduction. However,
   compared to ambient conditions, P addition with non-lethal crayfish
   still yielded greater per capita offspring standing stock by speeding
   individual snail growth enabling them to produce more offspring that
   also grew faster. Increased refuge use in response to non-lethal
   crayfish led to a non-lethal trophic cascade that altered the spatial
   distribution of periphyton. Independent of crayfish effects, snails
   stimulated periphyton growth through nutrient regeneration. These
   findings illustrate the importance of studying suites of traits that
   reveal costs associated with inducing different traits and how
   expressing those traits impacts population and community level
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{How does an organism's internal state direct its actions? At one moment
   an animal forages for food with acrobatic feats such as tree climbing

   way. These behaviors are costly in terms of energy or physical risk, and
   the likelihood of performing one set of actions relative to another is
   strongly modulated by internal state. For example, an animal in energy
   deficit searches for food and a dehydrated animal looks for water. The

Abstract = {{Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce)
   or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive
   literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble
   competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely
   neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as
   well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although
   individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance
   have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential
   interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional
   producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the
   relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair
   bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and
   alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger
   experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could
   produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen
   food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1)
   dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more
   successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by
   tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds
   scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly,
   individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions
   differing in food availability. Our study highlights the importance of
   taking both social factors and boldness (heterogeneity) into account
   when studying social-foraging dynamics and offers empirical data on food
   handling and alternative scrounging tactics that can be used to extend

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Predators that have learned to associate warning coloration with
   toxicity often continue to include aposematic prey in their diet in
   order to gain the nutrients and energy that they contain. As body size
   is widely reported to correlate with energetic content, we predicted
   that prey size would affect predators' decisions to eat aposematic prey.
   We used a well-established system of wild-caught European starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, foraging on mealworms, Tenebrio molitor, to test how
   the size of undefended (water-injected) and defended (quinine-injected)
   prey, on different coloured backgrounds, affected birds' decisions to
   eat defended prey. We found that birds ate fewer defended prey, and less
   quinine, when undefended prey were large compared with when they were
   small, but that the size of the defended prey had no effect on the
   numbers eaten. Consequently, we found no evidence that the mass of the
   defended prey or the overall mass of prey ingested affected the amount
   of toxin that a predator was willing to ingest, and instead the mass of
   undefended prey eaten was more important. This is a surprising finding,
   challenging the assumptions of state-dependent models of aposematism and
   mimicry, and highlighting the need to understand better the mechanisms
   of predator decision making. In addition, the birds did not learn to
   discriminate visually between defended and undefended prey based on
   size, but only on the basis of colour. This suggests that colour signals
   may be more salient to predators than size differences, allowing
   Batesian mimics to benefit from aposematic models even when they differ

Abstract = {{Parents have limited resources and, when simultaneously rearing multiple
   offspring, are expected to favour particularly valuable offspring.
   Because offspring characteristics like sex and ornamentation influence
   future reproductive value, these traits may influence parental
   favouritism. Parents in high-quality nest environments should prefer
   sons because sons show greater variability in reproductive potential
   than daughters. Moreover, when ornamental plumage coloration is
   condition dependent, parents should favour brighter over duller sons. We
   tested parental favouritism for fledgling-aged eastern bluebirds, Sialia
   sialis, a species in which fledglings display condition-dependent
   UV-blue coloration on their wings and tails. We simultaneously
   threatened two offspring with mock predators and recorded which
   offspring the parents defended. In accordance with the predicted value
   of offspring, fathers protected brighter over duller sons and protected
   sons over daughters when mated to high-quality mates. Mothers did not
   discriminate between sons and daughters or between brighter and duller
   sons. These results suggest that ornamental plumage coloration in
   juvenile bluebirds functions as a signal in father-off-spring
   interactions. Paternal and maternal responses of eastern bluebirds to
   offspring characteristics may differ because of differences in parental
   allocation strategies or because males assess offspring quality based on
   variation in plumage coloration, a trait that also functions in

Abstract = {{Males of many species prefer females that are more fecund, novel and/or
   sexually receptive. Males assess the desirability of potential mates
   using female morphological traits, including size and sexual coloration,
   or olfactory cues. However, few studies have directly examined how
   female behaviour influences male mate choice, which is surprising
   because males often respond strongly to female behaviours. We examined
   factors influencing male preference using the eastern fence lizard,
   Sceloporus undulatus, a species with a large repertoire of behavioural
   displays. Males were presented with two tethered females in a paired
   choice test, and we measured the time that males spent associating with
   and courting (shuddering to) each female. We recorded female behaviour,
   including approach to and retreat from the male, sidle-hopping (a
   rejection behaviour) and pushups. Males associated more with females
   that (1) approached and retreated from them, (2) did not sidlehop and
   (3) had relatively higher body condition. Likewise, males shuddered more
   to females that approached and retreated from them. Approach and retreat
   behaviours may advertise a female's readiness to mate, as these
   behaviours can heighten male interest, suggesting that males may be most
   likely to invest in courtship once females indicate their willingness to
   mate. Neither the female's pushup behaviour nor her snout-vent length
   influenced a male's tendency to associate with or court her. These
   results provide evidence that female behaviour has an important
   influence on male courtship behaviour. Incorporating measures of female
   behaviour into future studies on male mate choice may be illuminating
   and provide a greater ability to predict male preference. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Chronic exposure to stressors has been shown to suppress immune function
   in vertebrates, making them more susceptible to pathogens. It is less
   clear, however, whether many natural stressors are immunosuppressive.
   Moreover, whether stressors make disease more likely or more severe in
   populations is unclear because animals respond to stressors both
   behaviorally and physiologically. We tested whether chronic exposure to
   three natural stressors of wood frog tadpoles-high-densities,
   predator-cues, and low-food conditions-influence their susceptibility to
   a lethal ranavirus both individually in laboratory experiments, and
   collectively in outdoor mesocosms. Prior to virus exposure, we observed
   elevated corticosterone only in low-food treatments, although other
   treatments altered rates of growth and development as well as tadpole
   behavior. None of the treatments, however, increased susceptibility to
   ranavirus as measured by the proportion of tadpoles that became infected
   or died, or the time to death compared to controls. In fact, mortality
   in the mesocosms was actually lower in the high-density treatment even
   though most individuals became infected, largely because of increased
   rates of metamorphosis. Overall we find no support for the hypothesis
   that chronic exposure to common, ecologically relevant challenges
   necessarily elevates corticosterone levels in a population or leads to
   more severe ranaviral disease or epidemics. Conditions may, however,

Abstract = {{Life expectancy in the last century has greatly increased although, in
   most industrialized countries, this has been paralleled by an increased
   incidence of neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to cardiovascular
   and metabolic pathologies. The p66(Shc) gene has emerged as a novel
   gerontogene affecting health throughout life and during aging. In the
   last decade, studies on p66(Shc) knock-out mice have indicated that this
   gene is a crucial regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and
   is involved in age-related dysfunctions. p66(Shc-/-) mice show indeed a
   healthy phenotype characterized by greater brain and behavioral
   plasticity - associated to increased central levels of the neurotrophin
   Bran-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - in addition to reduced
   oxidative stress, fat accumulation and incidence of metabolic and
   cardiovascular pathologies. Studies performed in a semi-naturalistic
   setting, involving exposure to low temperatures and food shortage
   indicate that p66(Shc) has been conserved through evolution because of
   its role as ``thrifty gene{''} in energy metabolism. This feature, which
   allows survival in harsh natural conditions, can be deleterious when
   food is constantly available, as in westernized lifestyles, leading to
   fat accumulation and predisposing to metabolic, cardiovascular diseases
   and accelerating brain aging. Being at the crossroad of signaling
   pathways involved in both central and peripheral stress responses and in
   the regulation of energy homeostasis, p66(Shc) is a good candidate
   molecule to address the mechanisms underlying healthy aging and to be
   targeted for the development of novel pharmacological tools for the
   prevention or cure of age-related pathologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

   chimpanzees inhabiting small forest fragments within a cultivated
   landscape in Uganda. I determined diet over 13 mo via systematic fecal
   analysis, supplemented by direct observation and feeding trace evidence.
   I identified important foods and examined their role as seasonal
   fallbacks. Diet composition and breadth were overall species typical.
   Chimpanzees were highly frugivorous and the fruit component of fecal
   samples exceeded that of nonfruit fiber in all months. Forest fruit
   availability fluctuated seasonally, including a 3-mo low fruiting
   season, when overall fruit intake declined. During this time chimpanzees
   pursued a mixed strategy of increasing fiber consumption and feeding
   more heavily on energy-rich cultivars, including those obtained through
   crop raiding. The data suggest that exploiting agricultural fruits
   helped chimpanzees maintain a fruit-dominated diet when forest fruit was
   scarce. No evidence suggested this disturbed forest-farm mosaic is a
   food-impoverished habitat for chimpanzees overall. Nevertheless,
   cultivar feeding creates conflict with people and the high nutritional
   quality of crops is likely offset by the inherent risk associated with
   obtaining them. This study adds to growing evidence of ecological and
   behavioral adaptability of Pan troglodytes in response to anthropogenic
   habitat alteration. Targeted conservation of key natural foods for
   wildlife -particularly fallbacks- would help reduce conflicts and
   improve the survival prospects of threatened species sharing
   environments with people.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between temperature and diet quality can affect the life
   history of ectotherms. The rate and ratio at which protein and
   carbohydrate are obtained from food are important aspects of diet
   quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their
   feeding behaviour and post-ingestive physiology to regulate intake and
   allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate
   varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or
   metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour
   to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass
   Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated
   protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38
   degrees C as at 32 degrees C; however, at the higher temperature, they
   ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the
   nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32 degrees C, and
   protein at 38 degrees C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a
   protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed
   that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T.
   triandra selected 32 degrees C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38
   degrees C when deprived of protein. This capacity to use
   thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance
   improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted,
   locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective
   of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding
   host-plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed
   environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal-plant

Abstract = {{Strong evidence has accumulated over the last several years, showing
   that low sleep quantity and/or quality plays an important role in the
   elevation of blood pressure. We hypothesized that increasing sleep
   duration serves as an effective behavioral strategy to reduce blood
   pressure in prehypertension or type 1 hypertension. Twenty-two
   participants with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, and habitual
   sleep durations of 7h or less, participated in a 6-week intervention
   study. Subjects were randomized to a sleep extension group (48 +/-
   12years, N=13) aiming to increase bedtime by 1h daily over a 6-week
   intervention period, or to a sleep maintenance group (47 +/- 12years,
   N=9) aiming to maintain habitual bedtimes. Both groups received sleep
   hygiene instructions. Beat-to-beat blood pressure was monitored over
   24h, and 24-h urine and a fasting blood sample were collected pre- and
   post-intervention. Subjects in the sleep extension group increased their
   actigraphy-assessed daily sleep duration by 35 +/- 9min, while subjects
   in the sleep maintenance condition increased slightly by 4 +/- 9min
   (P=0.03 for group effect). Systolic and diastolic beat-to-beat blood
   pressure averaged across the 24-h recording period significantly
   decreased from pre- to post-intervention visit in the sleep extension

   reduction of 7 +/- 5 and 3 +/- 4mmHg in the sleep maintenance group was
   not significant, it did not differ from the blood pressure reduction in
   the sleep extension group (P=0.15 for interaction effect). These changes
   were not paralleled by pre- to post-intervention changes in inflammatory
   or sympatho-adrenal markers, nor by changes in caloric intake. While
   these preliminary findings have to be interpreted with caution due to

   whether behavioral interventions designed to increase sleep duration

Abstract = {{Group decisions on the timing of mutually exclusive activities pose a
   dilemma: monopolized decision-making by a single leader compromises the
   optimal timing of activities by the others, while independent
   decision-making by all group members undermines group coherence. Theory
   suggests that initiation of foraging should be determined by
   physiological demand in social foragers, thereby resolving the dilemma
   of group coordination. However, empirical support is scant, perhaps
   because intrinsic qualities predisposing individuals to leadership
   (social status, experience or personality), or their interactions with
   satiation level, have seldom been simultaneously considered. Here, we
   examine which females initiated foraging in eider (Somateria mollissima)
   brood-rearing coalitions, characterized by female dominance hierarchies
   and potentially large individual differences in energy requirements due
   to strenuous breeding effort. Several physiological and social factors,
   except for female breeding experience and boldness towards predators,
   explained foraging initiation. Initiators spent a larger proportion of
   time submerged during foraging bouts, had poorer body condition and
   smaller structural size, but they were also aggressive and occupied
   central positions. Initiation probability also declined with female
   group size as expected given random assignment of initiators. However,
   the relative importance of physiological predictors of leadership
   propensity (active foraging time, body condition, structural size)
   exceeded those of social predictors (aggressiveness, spatial position)
   by an order of magnitude. These results confirm recent theoretical work
   suggesting that `leading according to need' is an evolutionary viable
   strategy regardless of group heterogeneity or underlying dominance

   Invasion Success}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chemical cues provide aquatic organisms with sensory
   information that guides behavioural responses and thus interactions
   among themselves, each other and the environment. Chemical cues are
   considered important for predator avoidance, foraging, larval settlement
   and broadcast spawning in aquatic environments. However, the
   significance of their role as drivers of direct interactions between
   heterospecifics has been largely overlooked.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A video camera and a demarcated arena
   were used in situ to record behavioural responses of three native
   gastropod species, Assiminea cf. capensis, Melanoides tuberculata and
   Coriandria durbanensis, exposed to treatments representing chemical cues
   released by a non-native invasive gastropod, Tarebia granifera. The
   responses were measured quantitatively as displacement and orientation
   of movement at locations in St Lucia Estuary, within the iSimangaliso
   Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the east coast of South
   Africa. All native gastropods exhibited a negative taxis response to
   chemical cues released by T. granifera, while T. granifera individuals
   responded randomly to conspecifics. Displacement was measured relative
   to the source of the extract, the number of steps taken were determined
   with path analysis and orientation was determined from the mean (+/-
   95\% CIs) turning angles, with significant negative turning angles
   representing negative taxis. Responses to treatments corresponding to
   the environment and conspecifics were random and undirected, indicating
   kinesis.
   Conclusion/Significance: This study presents evidence for interactions
   driven by chemical cues between a non-native invasive gastropod and
   several gastropods native to South Africa. The results indicate that
   chemical cues can facilitate invasion success as the behavioural
   response of native gastropods is to move away allowing additional food
   and space resources to become available to T. granifera.}},

Volume = {{280}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of male ornamentation often reflects compromises between
   sexual and natural selection, but it may also be influenced by
   phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the developmental plasticity of
   male colour ornamentation in Trinidadian guppies in response to two
   environmental variables that covary in nature: predation risk and food
   availability. We found that exposure to chemical predator cues delayed
   the development of pigment-based colour elements, which are conspicuous
   to visual-oriented predators. Predator cues also reduced the size of
   colour elements at the time of maturity and caused adult males to be
   less colourful. To the best of our knowledge, these findings provide the
   first example of a plastic reduction in the development of a sexually
   selected male ornament in response to predator cues. The influence of
   predator cues on ornamentation probably affects individual fitness by
   reducing conspicuousness to predators, but could reduce attractiveness
   to females. Reduced food availability during development caused males to
   delay the development of colour elements and mature later, probably
   reflecting a physiological constraint, but their coloration at maturity
   and later in adulthood was largely unaffected, suggesting that variation
   in food quantity without variation in quality does not contribute to
   condition dependence of the trait.}},

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1049-1059}},

Abstract = {{Early juvenile environments influence trait expression in complex and
   often nonintuitive ways. Although the breadth of these effects is well
   recognized, researchers generally focus on the effect of single
   ecological triggers (such as resource availability, latitude or predator
   presence) on traits within a single dimension (e.g. morphological,
   behavioural or physiological phenotypes). This approach has yielded a
   wealth of knowledge about environmental conditions that trigger
   different plastic allocation strategies and reaction norms of a number
   of traits. However, it tells us little about the way in which early life
   conditions influence resource allocation, yielding differentially
   integrated adult phenotypes. Here, I argue that we must begin to
   understand how complex environments shape the conditional development
   and expression of suites of traits to produce complex, adaptive
   phenotypes. I begin by examining the importance of the juvenile
   environment when attempting to understand phenotypic expression at later
   life history stages. I describe how different types of plasticity affect
   relationships between traits, and I provide four case studies that
   illustrate the influence of plasticity on trait integration, which
   strongly suggests that evolution of norms of reaction must be considered
   if we are to understand the evolution of integrated phenotypes. I next
   highlight the importance of understanding the physiological and genetic
   underpinnings of this plasticity because such poorly understood aspects
   of the phenotype regulate developmental pathways that determine
   phenotypic expression. I conclude with suggestions as to how future
   research can begin to accommodate multidimensional approaches, and in
   doing so, further our understanding of an integrated phenotype concept.

Abstract = {{The zooplankter Daphnia exilis was found recently in reservoirs of
   central Chile. This species has been described as being tolerant to

   likelihood of being witnesses to a biological invasion, in this study we
   contribute to expand the knowledge of this exotic species through
   evaluating its ability to respond phenotypically to two major ecological
   factors: predation risk and food availability. Specifically, we analysed
   shifts in life-history and morphological traits of D. exilis in response
   to fish-released infochemicals, at different food densities. Our results
   revealed that the organisms were affected in their temporal trajectories
   of body size and shape, as well as in maturation time and fertility, in
   response to both predator cues and food availability. The presence of
   fish kairomones led to a decrease of age at maturity, and an increase of
   reproduction size and fecundity, especially at lower levels of
   resources. Our analyses indicated that asymptotic body size was affected
   only by food level, but the rate of increase in body size was sensitive
   to both fish kairomones and food level. The relative length of the tail
   spine decreased during early ontogenetic states, reaching a minimum
   around the age at maturity. This pattern was significantly enhanced in
   the presence of fish kairomones. However, our results did not match

Abstract = {{Objective: In this review, based on recent advances in cognitive
   neuroscience, the author presents a formulation in which the marked
   persistence of anorexia nervosa can be usefully understood as a
   well-ingrained maladaptive habit.
   Method: The author reviewed the relevant literature on the development
   and course of anorexia nervosa and interpreted critical features in
   light of developments in cognitive neuroscience.
   Results: Anorexia nervosa is a well characterized disorder with
   remarkable persistence both across history and among affected
   individuals. Food restriction, the salient behavioral feature of the
   disorder, often begins innocently but gradually takes on a life of its
   own. Over time, it becomes highly entrenched and resistant to change
   through either psychological or pharmacological treatment. Cognitive
   neuroscience has described two related but distinct processes that
   underlie the acquisition of new patterns of behavior, namely,
   action-outcome and stimulus-response learning. It is likely that both
   processes are engaged in the development of anorexia nervosa and that
   stimulus-response learning (that is, habit formation) is critical to the
   persistence of the dieting behavior.
   Conclusions: The formulation of the dieting behavior characteristic of
   anorexia nervosa as a well-entrenched habit provides a basis for
   understanding the striking persistence of this disorder. This model,
   helps explain the resistance of anorexia nervosa to interventions that
   have established efficacy in related disorders and implies that
   addressing the dieting behavior is critical, especially early in the
   course of the illness, before it has become ingrained. (Am J Psychiatry

Abstract = {{In both animal and human behavioral repertoires, classical expected
   utility theory is considered a fundamental element of decision making

   This paradox reveals that human behavioral patterns are often

Abstract = {{A whole-farm, stochastic and dynamic simulation model was developed to
   predict biophysical and economic performance of grazing dairy systems.
   Several whole-farm models simulate grazing dairy systems, but most of
   them work at a herd level. This model, named e-Dairy, differs from the
   few models that work at an animal level, because it allows stochastic
   behaviour of the genetic merit of individual cows for several traits,
   namely, yields of milk, fat and protein, live weight (LW) and body
   condition score (BCS) within a whole-farm model. This model accounts for
   genetic differences between cows, is sensitive to genotype x environment
   interactions at an animal level and allows pasture growth, milk and
   supplements price to behave stochastically. The model includes an
   energy-based animal module that predicts intake at grazing, mammary
   gland functioning and body lipid change. This whole-farm model simulates
   a 365-day period for individual cows within a herd, with cow parameters
   randomly generated on the basis of the mean parameter values, defined as
   input and variance and co-variances from experimental data sets. The
   main inputs of e-Dairy are farm area, use of land, type of pasture, type
   of crops, monthly pasture growth rate, supplements offered, nutritional
   quality of feeds, herd description including herd size, age structure,
   calving pattern, BCS and LW at calving, probabilities of pregnancy,
   average genetic merit and economic values for items of income and costs.
   The model allows to set management policies to define: dry-off cows
   (ceasing of lactation), target pre- and post-grazing herbage mass and
   feed supplementation. The main outputs are herbage dry matter intake,
   annual pasture utilisation, milk yield, changes in BCS and LW, economic
   farm profit and return on assets. The model showed satisfactory accuracy
   of prediction when validated against two data sets from farmlet system
   experiments. Relative prediction errors were <10\% for all variables,
   and concordance correlation coefficients over 0.80 for annual pasture
   utilisation, yields of milk and milk solids (MS; fat plus protein), and
   of 0.69 and 0.48 for LW and BCS, respectively. A simulation of two
   contrasting dairy systems is presented to show the practical use of the
   model. The model can be used to explore the effects of feeding level and
   genetic merit and their interactions for grazing dairy systems,
   evaluating the trade-offs between profit and the associated risk.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and predation risk
   can favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity as a means of tracking
   changing environments. However, because food abundance and predation
   risk often covary in nature, few studies have separated their effects or
   tested whether different phenotypic traits respond to the same sources
   of environmental variation. We investigated patterns of parental
   investment and behavior over a 7-year period in 2 island populations of
   orange-crowned warblers (Oreothlypis celata) that showed little genetic
   divergence but experienced dramatic temporal variation in rainfall and
   spatial variation in nest predation risk. The amount of rainfall in each
   year was correlated with food abundance, and birds on both islands
   initiated breeding earlier and laid larger clutches in wetter years. In
   contrast, the rate at which parents visited their nests was not affected
   by rainfall but was negatively correlated with nest predation risk both
   within and between islands. Our results suggest that although the
   effects of food availability and nest predation have been viewed as
   mutually exclusive drivers of entire suites of life-history and
   behavioral traits, these traits can differ in their sensitivity to
   resource abundance or mortality risk, and traits that are often
   correlated can be decoupled under appropriate environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection can operate both before and after mating. For males,
   selection will favor a suite of traits involved in mate acquisition
   (precopulatory) and in the competition among ejaculates to fertilize
   eggs (postcopulatory). Sperm competition theory predicts a trade-off
   between investment in pre- and postcopulatory traits, thus generating
   negative correlations between traits that function during both episodes
   of selection. However, such trade-offs can be difficult to detect
   because they are typically sensitive to the pool of resources available
   for allocation to competing functions. Although theory predicts that
   trade-offs will be more apparent when resources are limiting, there have
   been few attempts to test this prediction. In our study, we used the
   freshwater fish, Poecilia reticulata, to examine how both pre- and
   postcopulatory sexually selected traits simultaneously respond to
   manipulations of diet quantity by comparing behavioral, ornamental, and
   ejaculate traits between males assigned at random to either a ad libitum
   or a restricted food diet. We also explore how the relationships between
   traits that function during pre- and postcopulatory episodes of
   selection are affected by these treatments. Our results reveal that diet
   manipulations influenced the expression of both precopulatory (sexual
   behavior and ornamentation) and postcopulatory sexually selected traits
   (sperm viability), reinforcing the importance of resource acquisition in
   sexual selection. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that
   males trade off their allocation toward these pre- and postcopulatory
   sexually selected traits. Instead, changes in the expression of pre- and
   postcopulatory sexually selected traits appear to occur independently.}},

Title = {{A cluster-randomised, controlled trial to assess the impact of a
   workplace osteoporosis prevention intervention on the dietary and
   physical activity behaviours of working women: study protocol}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease and its risk can be
   reduced through adequate calcium consumption and physical activity. This
   protocol paper describes a workplace-based intervention targeting
   behaviour change in premenopausal women working in sedentary
   occupations.
   Method/Design: A cluster-randomised design was used, comparing the
   efficacy of a tailored intervention to standard care. Workplaces were
   the clusters and units of randomisation and intervention. Sample size
   calculations incorporated the cluster design. Final number of clusters
   was determined to be 16, based on a cluster size of 20 and calcium
   intake parameters (effect size 250 mg, ICC 0.5 and standard deviation
   290 mg) as it required the highest number of clusters. Sixteen
   workplaces were recruited from a pool of 97 workplaces and randomly
   assigned to intervention and control arms (eight in each). Women meeting
   specified inclusion criteria were then recruited to participate.
   Workplaces in the intervention arm received three participatory
   workshops and organisation wide educational activities. Workplaces in
   the control/standard care arm received print resources. Intervention
   workshops were guided by self-efficacy theory and included participatory
   activities such as goal setting, problem solving, local food sampling,
   exercise trials, group discussion and behaviour feedback.
   Outcomes measures were calcium intake (milligrams/day) and physical
   activity level (duration: minutes/week), measured at baseline, four
   weeks and six months post intervention.
   Discussion: This study addresses the current lack of evidence for
   behaviour change interventions focussing on osteoporosis prevention. It
   addresses missed opportunities of using workplaces as a platform to
   target high-risk individuals with sedentary occupations. The
   intervention was designed to modify behaviour levels to bring about risk
   reduction. It is the first to address dietary and physical activity
   components each with unique intervention strategies in the context of
   osteoporosis prevention. The intervention used locally relevant
   behavioural strategies previously shown to support good outcomes in
   other countries. The combination of these elements have not been
   incorporated in similar studies in the past, supporting the study
   hypothesis that the intervention will be more efficacious than standard
   practice in osteoporosis prevention through improvements in calcium
   intake and physical activity.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Hunting live prey is risky and thought to require specialized
   adaptations. Therefore, observations of predatory cannibalism in
   otherwise non-carnivorous animals raise questions about its function,
   adaptive significance and evolutionary potential. Here we document
   predatory cannibalism on larger conspecifics in Drosophila melanogaster
   larvae and address its evolutionary significance. We found that under
   crowded laboratory conditions younger larvae regularly attack and
   consume `wandering-stage' conspecifics, forming aggregations mediated by
   chemical cues from the attacked victim. Nutrition gained this way can be
   significant: an exclusively cannibalistic diet was sufficient for normal
   development from eggs to fertile adults. Cannibalistic diet also induced
   plasticity of larval mouth parts. Finally, during 118 generations of
   experimental evolution, replicated populations maintained under larval
   malnutrition evolved enhanced propensity towards cannibalism. These
   results suggest that, at least under laboratory conditions, predation on
   conspecifics in Drosophila is a functional, adaptive behaviour, which
   can rapidly evolve in response to nutritional conditions.}},

   were not exposed to predatory fish cues, but we found limited evidence

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous forces of selection associated with fluctuating
   environments are recognized as important factors involved in the

   Consistent behavioural differences over time and across situations (e.g.
   personality) are increasingly cited as examples of individual variation
   observed within populations. However, the suggestion that heterogeneous
   selective pressures target different animal personalities remains
   largely untested in the wild. In this 5-year study, we investigated the
   dynamics of viability selection on a personality trait, exploration, in
   a population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) experiencing
   substantial seasonal variations in weather conditions and food
   availability associated with masting trees. Contrary to our
   expectations, we found no evidence of fluctuating selection on
   exploration. Instead, we found strong disruptive viability selection on
   adult exploration behaviour, independent of seasonal variations.
   Individuals with either low or high exploration scores were almost twice
   as likely to survive over a 6-month period compared with individuals
   with intermediate scores. We found no evidence of viability selection on
   juvenile exploration. Our results highlight that disruptive selection

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Prey often suffer foraging costs associated with antipredator behaviours
   such as vigilance. Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead
   to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance.
   However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than
   by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by
   synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we
   compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total
   foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially
   migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on
   their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine
   whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of
   forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal
   individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at
   adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus,
   predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant
   elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was
   highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they
   were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by
   synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for
   higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows
   how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to
   demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours.

Abstract = {{It is widely assumed that in the late nineteenth century Lobesia botrana
   Den. and Schiff. shifted its food source from a wild shrub (Daphne
   gnidium L.) to vine (Vitis vinifera L.). We explored if host range
   expansion reflects an evolutionary host shift, whereby the new moth-host
   association was linked to adaptive changes. The reaction norms of larval
   survival, adult weight and development time were investigated in L.
   botrana under field conditions. Two moth strains were established from
   vine and daphne, and reciprocal infestations with neonate larvae were
   performed on both host plants over the three larval generations. All
   three traits showed phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation,
   variation for plasticity being only detected in larval survival.
   Comparisons between hosts within strains showed that (1) larval survival
   was higher on vine in 9 of 12 cases, (2) adult weight was lower on vine
   only in the first generation and (3) development time was shorter on
   vine in first generation, shorter on daphne in third generation and
   displayed a sex-related response in the second generation. Comparisons
   between strains within hosts evidenced moth-host adaptation as larval
   survival increased when strains developed on its original host. There
   was also evidence of moth-parasitoid coevolution because parasitism
   level was strain-dependent. We hypothesize that higher larval survival
   on vine, similar adult weight on both hosts in summer generations and
   lower predation risk in vineyards, might be among the fitness-related
   factors explaining evolutionary host shift to and worldwide adaptive
   success on vine of L. botrana.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging birds can manage time spent vigilant for predators by forming
   groups of various sizes. However, group size alone will not always

   variation in predation risk or food quality between patches may also be
   influential. In a field setting, we assessed how simultaneous variation
   in predation risk and intake rate affects the relationship between
   vigilance and group size in foraging Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria

   content and proximity to cover from which predators could launch
   surprise attacks. Habitats closer to predator cover provided foragers
   with much higher potential net energy intake rates than habitats further
   from cover. Foragers formed larger and denser flocks on habitats closer
   to cover. Individual vigilance of foragers in all habitats declined with
   increasing flock size and increased with flock density. However,
   vigilance by foragers on habitats closer to cover was always higher for
   a given flock size than vigilance by foragers on habitats further from
   cover, and habitat remained an important predictor of vigilance in
   models including a range of potential confounding variables. Our results

Abstract = {{Child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems are common and
   serious all over the world and are linked to pre-mature deaths and
   serious dysfunction in adult life. Effective interventions have been
   developed in high income countries (HIC), but evidence from low income
   settings is scarce and scattered. The aim of this paper is to identify
   the most promising interventions in the area of global CAMH.
   A systematic review of all randomised controlled trials in CAMH in low
   and middle income countries (LAMIC) was carried out and supplemented by
   1a level evidence from HIC as well as suitable information from child
   programme evaluations and adult studies in LAMIC.
   In behavioural disorders parent training is a highly promising
   intervention, which can successfully improve children's compliance and
   bring down rates of conduct problems significantly. In young children
   cognitive, emotional and behavioural development can be enhanced through
   nutritional supplements and by stimulation through play, praise and
   reading. Trauma treatments can bring positive results even in severely
   traumatised children, who remain in unstable living conditions. In
   developmental disorders, there are successful prevention strategies as
   well as programmes that bring children out of isolation and improve
   their independence. Some classroom-based interventions for adolescents
   have reduced symptoms of common mental disorders as well as risk taking
   behaviours.
   While many results are still tentative the evidence suggests that it is
   possible to develop affordable and feasible interventions that
   significantly improve the lives of affected children, their families and
   their communities around the world.}},

Abstract = {{The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is commonly used to assess risky decision

   Participants were 91 undergraduate students (38 male) who completed
   measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking, behavioral activation and
   inhibition, state mood, and the computerized IGT. Results indicated that
   negative mood, drive, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were all

   with Deck D selections. No differences emerged in correlations between

Abstract = {{Tissue analysis is commonly used in ecology and agronomy to portray
   plant nutrient signatures. Nutrient concentration data, or ionomes,
   belong to the compositional data class, i.e., multivariate data that are
   proportions of some whole, hence carrying important numerical
   properties. Statistics computed across raw or ordinary log-transformed
   nutrient data are intrinsically biased, hence possibly leading to wrong
   inferences. Our objective was to present a sound and robust approach
   based on a novel nutrient balance concept to classify plant ionomes. We
   analyzed leaf N, R K, Ca, and Mg of two wild and six domesticated fruit
   species from Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand sampled during reproductive
   stages. Nutrient concentrations were (1) analyzed without
   transformation, (2) ordinary log-transformed as commonly but incorrectly
   applied in practice, (3) additive log-ratio (air) transformed as
   surrogate to stoichiometric rules, and (4) converted to isometric
   log-ratios OH arranged as sound nutrient balance variables. Raw
   concentration and ordinary log transformation both led to biased
   multivariate analysis due to redundancy between interacting nutrients.
   The air- and ilr-transformed data provided unbiased discriminant
   analyses of plant ionomes, where wild and domesticated species formed
   distinct groups and the ionomes of species and cultivars were
   differentiated without numerical bias. The ilr nutrient balance concept
   is preferable to air, because the ilr technique projects the most
   important interactions between nutrients into a convenient Euclidean
   space.This novel numerical approach allows rectifying historical biases
   and supervising phenotypic plasticity in plant nutrition studies.}},

Title = {{beta-endorphin modulates the effect of stress on novelty-suppressed
   feeding}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Although stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety
   disorders, not all individuals who suffer stressful life events develop
   psychopathology. Differential susceptibility to stress may be influenced
   by genetically mediated differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis activity and moderation of the stress response by the opioid
   peptide beta-endorphin (beta-E). The present study investigated genetic
   contributions to coping behavior by examining anxious behavior of
   transgenic mice with varying capacities to synthesize beta-E
   {[}B6.129S2-Pomc(tm1Low)/J; regulated by insertion of a premature stop
   codon into one or both copies of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene],
   both under normal conditions and following 3 min of forced swim (FS).
   Ten minutes after this stress exposure or a control manipulation,
   acutely food-deprived female and male transgenic mice were subjected to
   a novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, during which their interaction
   with an almond slice located in the center of an open field box was
   measured. There was an interaction between genotype and stress for
   latency to approach the almond and whether or not the almond was
   approached, such that mice with low or absent beta-E displayed a
   stronger aversion to novelty-feeding after stress exposure than did mice
   with normal levels. These data provide evidence for a moderating effect
   of beta-E on the behavioral response to stress. Genotypic differences in
   anxious behavior emerged when mice were stressed prior to behavioral
   assessment, suggesting that beta-E plays a role in coping behavior.
   These findings indicate that genetic variability in sensitivity of the
   beta-E system to stress may contribute, at least in part, to heritable
   differences in stress reactivity as well as vulnerability to
   stress-related psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that
   individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both
   across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have
   personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an
   individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas
   it is well established that the environment can have profound influences
   on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely
   linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to
   contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the
   environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the
   life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle,
   Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality
   food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared
   on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to
   vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3
   personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted
   explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality
   dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future
   prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder,
   thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in
   foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more
   active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future
   reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the
   energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not
   only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an
   individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Early malnutrition is a highly prevalent condition in
   developing countries. Different rodent models of postnatal early
   malnutrition have been used to approach the subject experimentally,
   inducing early malnutrition by maternal malnutrition, temporal maternal
   separation, manipulation of litter size or the surgical nipple ligation
   to impair lactation. Studies on the behaviour of (previously)
   malnourished animals using animal models have produced sometimes
   contradictory results regarding the effects of early postnatal
   malnutrition and have been criticized for introducing potential
   confounding factors.
   The present paper is a first report on the behavioural effects of early
   malnutrition induced by an alternative approach: mice nursed by
   alpha-casein-deficient knockout dams showed a severe growth delay during
   early development and substantial catch-up growth after weaning when
   compared with animals nursed by wild-type females.
   Methods: Established behavioural tests were used to study the
   consequences of early postnatal malnutrition on mouse pups at weaning
   and after partial weight recovery.
   Results: Despite the impaired growth, the only behavioural difference
   between malnourished and normally growing animals was found in
   exploratory behaviour during acute malnutrition at the time of weaning.
   After partial catch-up in weight early protein malnourished animals
   showed no indication of lasting effects on general activity,
   emotionality and exploration, memory, and pain reactivity.
   Discussion: These results suggest that the role of early nutrition on
   behavioural development after recovery in animal models may have been
   overestimated. Further careful examination of this animal model in terms
   of maternal care and offspring behaviour will be necessary to confirm if
   mice nursed by alpha-casein-deficient dams offer an alternative to
   existing models while eliminating potential confounding factors.}},

   set out to understand the relationships across behavioural categories in
   wild-caught adult, female big brown bats and how they compare between
   social and solitary behaviours. Using bats sampled from four different
   maternity colonies, we ran a series of behavioural assays to create a

   linked to increased competitive ability but not to boldness. Our results
   indicate that the solitary and socially directed behaviours of
   individuals are not necessarily related and that behaviours pertaining
   to social interactions are linked most closely to learning abilities.
   Furthermore, we found evidence that poor body condition may be a
   predictor of increased social interactions and that behaviours exhibited

Abstract = {{Variation in somatic growth rates is of great interest to biologists
   because of the relationship between growth and other fitness-determining
   traits, and it results from both genetic and environmentally induced
   variation (i.e. plasticity). Theoretical predictions suggest that mean
   somatic growth rates and the shape of the reaction norm for growth can
   be influenced by variation in predator-induced mortality rates. Few
   studies have focused on variation in reaction norms for growth in
   response to resource availability between high-predation and
   low-predation environments. We used juvenile Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora
   from high-predation and low-predation environments to test for variation
   in mean growth rates and for variation in reaction norms for growth at
   two levels of food availability in a common-environment experiment. To
   test for variation in growth rates in the field, we compared somatic
   growth rates in juveniles in high-predation and low-predation
   environments. In the common-environment experiment, mean growth rates
   did not differ between fish from differing predation environments, but
   the interaction between predation environment and food level took the
   form of a crossing reaction norm for both growth in length and mass.
   Fish from low-predation environments exhibited no significant difference
   in growth rate between high and low food treatments. In contrast, fish
   from high-predation environments exhibited variation in growth rates
   between high and low food treatments, with higher food availability
   resulting in higher growth rates. In the field, individuals in the
   high-predation environment grow at a faster rate than those in
   low-predation environments at the smallest sizes (comparable to sizes in
   the common-environment experiment). These data provide no evidence for
   evolved differences in mean growth rates between predation environments.
   However, fish from high-predation environments exhibited greater
   plasticity in growth rates in response to resource availability
   suggesting that predation environments may exhibit increased variation
   in food availability for prey fish and consequent selection for
   plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Egg cannibalism is a widely observed behaviour in nature that provides

   behaviour, neonates were fed no, one, or two eggs upon hatching, along
   with their normal diet of potato foliage. Daily mass, the time to each
   moult, adult volume and mass, and fecundity were measured for each
   individual, along with mortality rates. Cannibals gained mass more
   quickly and reached each developmental stage 1 day earlier than
   noncannibals. No benefits at the adult stage (other than earlier
   emergence) were observed, and there were no sex differences in the
   benefits of cannibalism. Mortality was not reduced by cannibalism under
   laboratory conditions. A simulation demonstrated that when the mortality
   risk is high, decreased development time due to cannibalism can reduce
   this risk sufficiently to balance the inclusive fitness loss of eating a
   single half-sibling. Additional benefits of cannibalism, such as reduced

Abstract = {{Fission-fusion systems provide models for studying grouping decisions
   and social complexity in a range of taxa, as individuals act to manage
   risks and enhance reproductive success. African savannah elephants,
   Loxodonta africana africana, live in a fluid society where individual
   relationships persist over decades and affect reproductive success.
   Social structures have yet to be fully characterized for forest
   elephants, Loxodonta africana cyclotis. Aggregations at natural forest
   clearings, which are frequent in this subspecies, may offer social
   benefits in addition to nutritional resources. We examined the social
   functions of aggregations in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of
   Congo. We tested whether clearings function as `social arenas' by
   examining how social opportunities affected the timing and duration of
   visits, and how short-term grouping decisions were affected by age, sex,
   group size and number of elephants present. Aggregations reflected a
   fission-fusion society similar to that observed in savannah elephants.
   Grouping patterns were largely unaffected by the number of elephants
   present, from which we infer that elephants were not acting to minimize
   competition. Social opportunities affected visit patterns such that
   visits were longer when others were present. Social opportunities were
   maximized by joining large groups, often including older elephants, or,
   for males, parties with females. Large and dynamically changing social
   groups in clearings offer potential for information exchange and the
   maintenance of social relationships. Demonstrating that fission-fusion
   operates in forest elephant society allows future research to focus on
   cost-benefit modelling, to understand the fitness consequences of these
   groupings. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Adults that cannibalize juvenile conspecifics gain substantial energy
   and nutrients that are potentially limited in their normal diet, but
   they may also face the risk of filial cannibalism: the consumption of an
   individual's own offspring. However, the potential costs and benefits of
   cannibalism change with the reproductive status of an individual during
   its lifetime. Once adults become reproductively active, they suddenly
   face the potential loss of inclusive fitness associated with filial
   cannibalism, but they also have higher energy demands that could easily
   be met with cannibalism. Thus, selection should favour any behaviour
   that reduces the risk of filial cannibalism while maximizing the
   nutritional and other benefits of cannibalism. Here we take an
   experimental approach to examine the relative importance of kin
   discrimination, reproductive status and sex differences in influencing
   cannibalistic behaviour (including filial cannibalism) of adults using
   confused flour beetles, Tribolium confusum, as a model system. Using a
   series of complementary experiments, we show that the cannibalistic
   behaviour of T. confusum is driven by a combination of two factors that
   both reduce the risk of filial cannibalism. First, reproductive females
   preferred to cannibalize unrelated eggs over related eggs, indicating
   clear kin discrimination. In addition, females also showed a dramatic
   reduction in the general propensity for cannibalism after becoming
   reproductively active. Interestingly, the onset of reproduction also
   reduced cannibalism rates in males, indicating that this change in
   cannibalistic behaviour is consistent across sexes. Mating status had a
   greater influence on cannibalism rates than did sex. Together, kin
   discrimination and mating-status-dependent shifts in cannibalism rates
   reduced the risk of filial cannibalism by up to six- fold. In general,
   our findings suggest that evolution can alter the cannibalistic
   behaviour of individuals in multiple ways to reduce the risk of filial
   cannibalism while still maximizing the benefits of cannibalism. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A profusion of theoretical and empirical studies has successfully

   during winter. In many species, individual dominance status will affect
   access to food and predation risk, and is therefore predicted to
   influence patterns of optimal body mass further. We investigated body
   mass regulation via repeated measurements without capture in groups of
   Siberian jays, Perisoreus infaustus, during autumn. As predicted, body
   mass of individuals increased throughout the day and towards the winter
   and was higher during colder periods. Jay body mass was also correlated
   with wind chill conditions 23 h before. This makes sense since
   conditions 24 h earlier were a better predictor of current conditions
   than conditions either 12 or 48 h earlier. Dominant birds (i.e.
   breeders) that were large carried relatively lower fat reserves than
   large subordinate individuals. The opposite was true for morphologically
   small birds. Together this suggests tighter requirements for individual
   variation in mass for dominant breeders in these groups. Our findings in
   this food-hoarding corvid are in general agreement with models and
   results concerning much smaller birds. (C) 2012 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Movement behaviour plays an important role in many ecological
   interactions. As animals move through the environment, they generate
   movement patterns, which are a combined result of landscape
   characteristics and species-specific behaviour. Measuring these ranging
   patterns is being facilitated by technological advances in collection
   methods, such as GPS collars, that are capturing movement on finer
   spatial and temporal scales. We propose the use of a novel
   spatiotemporal analytical framework (ST-BBD), based on the beta-binomial
   distribution (BBD) model, to measure small-scale aggregation in animal
   movement data sets, including two simulated and three collected primate
   data sets. We use this approach to distinguish different habitat uses of
   three primate species (red colobus, Procolobus rufomitratus, black
   howler, Alouatta pigra, and spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi) and
   quantify their specific use of the landscape in space and in time, using
   a parameter of the BBD that measures the variation in sites visited on a
   landscape. We found that estimates of aggregation in habitat use were
   higher in the frugivorous spider monkey, compared to the more folivorous
   howler monkey, and that in the red colobus, aggregation in site visits
   was dependent on group size and food availability. Applications of this
   framework to animal movement data could be useful in understanding
   ecological systems where habitat use is an important factor, such as the
   relationships between hosts and parasites, or parent plants and seed
   dispersers. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Ecological and medical researchers are investing great effort to
   determine the role of Maternally-Derived Stress (MDS) as an inducer of
   phenotypic plasticity in offspring. Many researchers have interpreted
   phenotypic responses as unavoidable negative outcomes (e.g., small birth
   weight, high anxiety); however, a biased underestimate of the adaptive
   potential of MDS-induced effects is possible if they are not viewed
   within an ecologically relevant or a life-history optimization
   framework. We review the ecological and environmental drivers of MDS,
   how MDS signals are transferred to offspring, and what responses MDS
   induces. Results from four free-living vertebrate systems reveals that
   although MDS induces seemingly negative investment trade-offs in
   offspring, these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better
   match the offspring to future environments; however, responses can prove
   maladaptive if they unreliably predict (i.e., are mismatched to) future
   environments. Furthermore, MDS-induced adjustments that may prove
   maladaptive for individual offspring can still prove adaptive to mothers
   by reducing current reproductive investment, and benefitting lifetime
   reproductive success. We suggest that to properly determine the adaptive
   potential of MDS, researchers must take a broader integrated
   life-history perspective, appreciate both the immediate and longer term

   were quantified independently through time and across three contexts:

Abstract = {{Introduction. Although sexual behavior is an integral part of most
   adults' overall well-being, this aspect of psoriasis patients' quality
   of life is rarely explored. Aim. The aim of this study is to assess the
   relationship between psoriasis and sexual behavior in U.S. women.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2006. Our study focuses on
   responses to the dermatology and sexual behavior questionnaires of the
   NHANES. Main Outcome Measures. This study examines the association
   between psoriasis and sexual behavior in U.S. women with regard to
   sexual orientation, age of first sexual encounter, number of sexual
   partners, and frequency of unprotected sex. Results. A total of 3,462
   women provided responses to their psoriasis status: 2,753 (80\%) women
   were heterosexual and 709 (20\%) were nonheterosexual. Among them, 2.7\%
   reported a physician-given diagnosis of psoriasis. On multivariate
   analyses, psoriasis was not associated with differences in sexual
   orientation (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.90, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.622.01). Among nonheterosexual women, multivariate analysis revealed a
   lower number of lifetime female sexual partners in women with psoriasis
   (rate ratio {[}RR] 0.11, 95\% CI 0.040.33, P = 0.001). Among
   heterosexual women, no significant differences existed between those
   with and without psoriasis in age of first sexual encounter (weighted
   difference -0.54 years, 95\% CI -1.27 to 0.19), number of lifetime male
   sexual partners (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.692.06), or number of lifetime male
   oral sex partners (RR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.401.29). Heterosexual women with
   psoriasis had 1.13 times more unprotected sex (RR 1.13, 95\% CI
   1.021.24, P = 0.03) compared with those without psoriasis. Conclusion.
   Psoriasis is associated with a significantly reduced number of sexual
   partners in nonheterosexual women. Psoriasis may differentially impact
   sexual behavior based on sexual orientation in women. Armstrong AW,

   people in the autistic spectrum. Conclusion: Behavioural and

Abstract = {{The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, feeds on the blood of mammal and
   bird hosts, and is a pest of global importance. Semiochemicals are
   chemicals involved in animal communication that may affect behaviour
   and/or physiology. Attractive semiochemicals that play a role in
   mediating bed bug behaviour could be exploited for the development of a
   highly effective novel monitoring device. Tracking software was used to
   record the response of bed bugs to volatiles from paper previously
   exposed to conspecific bugs in a still-air olfactometer illuminated by
   infrared lights, through a variety of activity variables. The effect of
   time of day as an extrinsic factor, and sex, stage, mating status and
   nutritional status as physiological factors on the response of bed bugs
   to the volatiles was examined. Bed bugs of both sexes and all stages
   responded to the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers, showing
   significant attraction and orientation towards the volatile source
   whether they were starved or engorged. Confirmation that the
   physiological factors examined do not affect the response of bed bugs to
   the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers provides evidence that these
   bed bug-derived volatiles contain aggregation cues, as semiochemicals
   that promote aggregation should by definition be detected by both sexes
   and all life stages. A device baited with such semiochemicals could play
   a major role in limiting the impact of the current bed bug resurgence by
   enabling timely detection of infestations, along with quantitative
   evaluation of control and effective surveillance of the geographical
   distribution of the pest species.}},

Abstract = {{Vigilance is an essential component of antipredator behaviour and is
   also used to monitor conspecifics, but is traded off against feeding in
   herbivores. This trade-off can be influenced by variation in many
   environmental, social and individual traits. Our aim was to test the
   relationship between individual-level traits, including boldness, body
   condition and reproductive state, and vigilance, while controlling for
   environmental and social variables. Using multiple 5-min video samples
   of 30 foraging, individually recognisable, female eastern grey kangaroos
   (Macropus giganteus) at Sundown National Park in Queensland, we
   investigated individual-level variation in the duration, intensity and
   target of vigilance behaviour during foraging. On separate occasions, we
   used flight-initiation distance tests to measure boldness in our
   kangaroos. Females with longer flight-initiation distances (shyer
   females) spent more time vigilant, providing preliminary support for
   studies of animal personality that have suggested that boldness may
   covary with vigilance. Body condition did not affect the total time
   spent vigilant, but females in poorer body condition spent more of their
   vigilance time in low-intensity vigilance. Vigilance patterns were not
   related to reproductive state, but varied among months and differed
   between mornings and afternoons, and females spent more time in
   high-intensity vigilance when further from cover. Even after accounting
   for all our variables we found that 7\% of the variation in total time
   vigilant and 14\% of the variation in vigilance intensity was explained
   by individual identity. This highlights the importance of
   individual-level variation in vigilance behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the diel vertical distribution patterns of
   microcrustacean,zooplankton (Cladocera, Copepoda) in a shallow pond

   during three 24-h periods in July (19-20th), August (17-18th) and
   September (11-12th) 2011. Environmental variables showed remarkable
   vertical stratification. Oxygen concentration was close to zero in the
   entire water column from night until sunrise, while the lower strata
   (from 20 cm below the surface) were close to anoxic during all three
   diel cycles. It proved to be the main determinant of the vertical
   distribution of microcrustaceans. Accordingly, the highest proportion of
   individuals was present in the surface layer. Chlorophyll-a
   concentration and phytoplankton biomass were inversely distributed
   compared to zooplankton. Microcrustaceans (mainly Daphnia curvirostris)
   migrated to the middle layer only in August, which could be explained by
   a trade-off between food resources, dissolved oxygen (DO) and
   competition with littoral zooplankters. The diurnal density patterns of
   microcrustaceans suggested horizontal migration into the aquatic
   macrophytes during night, which could be a strategy to avoid Chaoborus
   predation. Our results show that strong vertical gradients of abiotic
   and biotic factors occur even in such shallow waterbodies. Among them,
   DO can maintain constant vertical aggregation of zooplankters by

Abstract = {{As top predators, striped bass Morone saxatilis and their hybrids often
   accumulate pollutants and prompt recommendations for reduced
   consumption. Economists have estimated the economic effect of fish
   consumption advisories on anglers using nonmarket valuation techniques.
   Following a brief discussion of advisories policy in the United States
   and the theoretical underpinning for estimating economic losses they may
   cause, I contrast estimates of economic loss (consumer surplus) with
   measures of economic impact. In a comprehensive review of the economic
   costs of advisories in freshwater fisheries, I found that economists
   have focused almost exclusively on only the most extreme of angler's
   responses. These were changing the sites at which an angler fishes or
   changing the number of fishing trips during the season (ignoring losses
   associated with behavioral responses, such as changing target species,
   engaging in more careful food preparation, or strictly complying with
   recommended consumption limits). For decision makers needing to conduct
   benefit-cost analysis of an advisory policy but lacking the time or
   budget needed for an original study, I outline the method of benefit
   transfer. The paper concludes with a number of research topics not yet
   considered by economists: behavioral responses to advisories besides
   adjusting the site or number of trips, heterogeneity among anglers'
   preferences, and the effect of differences in perceived risk of
   consuming contaminated fish.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is a multicausal disorder and has been associated with the
   risk to develop cancer, dementia, diabetes, epilepsy and stroke. As a
   metabolic disorder depression has been associated with obesity,
   diabetes, insulin sensitivity, neuropeptide Y, glucose regulation, poor
   glycemic control, glucagone-like peptide-1, cholezystokinin, ghrelin,
   leptin, the endocannabinoid system, insulin-like growth factor and
   gastrin-releasing peptide. As a cardiovascular disease a close
   relationship exists between depression and blood pressure, heart rate,
   norepinephrine, sympathetic tone, vascular resistance, blood viscosity,
   plasma volume, intima thickness and atherosclerosis. Additionally blood
   coagulation, fibrinolysis, D-dimers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
   protein, platelet activation, VEGF, plasma nitric oxide and its synthase
   are changed in depressed patients. As an endocrinological and stress
   disorder depression has been connected with the concentration of free
   T-4, TSH, CRH, arginine vasopressin, corticotrophin, corticosteroid
   release and ACTH. Depression as an inflammatory disorder is mediated by
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, TNF-alpha,
   soluble interleukin-2 receptors, interferon-alpha, interleukin 8,
   interleukin-10, hs-CRP, acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, toll like
   receptor 4, interleukin-1beta, mammalian target of rapamycin pathway,
   substance P, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin-E2, lipid peroxidation
   levels and acid sphingomyelinase. Nutritional factors might influence
   depression risk, i.e. the consumption of folate, omega-3 fatty acids,
   monounsaturated fatty acids, olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
   legumes, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. The neurodegenerative hypothesis of
   depression explains decreased hippocampal volumes in depressed patients
   and changes of neurotrophic support by BDNF, erythropoietin, GDNF,
   FGF-2, NT3, NGF and growth hormone. In this context, a fast
   neuroprotective and antidepressant effect has also been observed by
   ketamine, which acts via the glutamatergic system. Hence, GABA, AMPA,
   EAAT, NMDA- and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 to mGluR8) have
   gained interest in depression recently. Alternative, causative or also
   easy available treatment strategies beyond serotonin and noradrenaline
   reuptake inhibition might be a major topic of future psychiatric care.
   In this review, an attempt is made to overview concepts of the disease
   and search for perspectives on antidepressant treatment strategies
   beyond approved medications. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{The range of responses made to environmental exigencies by animals,
   including humans, may be impacted by the experiences of their
   progenitors. In mammals, pathways have been documented ranging from
   transactions between a mother and her developing fetus in the womb
   through continuity of parenting practices and cultural inheritance. In
   addition, phenotypic plasticity may be constrained by factors
   transmitted by the gametes that are involved in the regulation of gene
   expression rather than modifications to the genome itself. Possible
   mediators for this kind of inheritance are examined, and the conditions
   that might have led to the evolution of such transmission are
   considered. Anticipatory adjustments to possible environmental
   exigencies are likely to occur when such conditions recur regularly, but
   intermittently across generations and endure for substantial periods of
   time, and when adjusting to them after the fact is likely to be
   biologically costly, even life-threatening. It appears that physical
   growth and responses to nutrient availability are domains in which
   anticipatory, epigenetically inherited adjustments occur. In addition,
   given the fact that humans have oppressed one another repeatedly and for
   relatively long periods of time, such behavioral tendencies as boldness
   or innovativeness may be behavioral traits subject to such effects. The
   implications of these factors for research and policy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A population of dice snakes (Natrix tessellate) monitored since 2008 in
   a small island (18 ha, 850 m a.s.l., FYR of Macedonia) revealed
   unforeseen patterns for snakes living in temperate climates. More than
   5000 individuals have been marked and the density is one of the highest
   ever recorded (>500 resident snakes per hectare). Reproductive and
   mortality rates are elevated, suggesting a high population turnover.
   These traits evoke a tropical rather than a temperate-climate ophidian
   demographic system. The population is highly polymorphic, three colour
   morphs (dotted, grey, and black) are observed in both sexes and each
   morph is represented by large numbers of individuals. This polymorphism
   pattern was not previously documented in snakes. Data obtained for other
   life history traits (e.g. body size, size at maturity, clutch size,
   diet, predation) markedly diverged in comparison to available
   information. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that the strong
   inter-population variability (often mediated by phenotypic plasticity)
   of snakes should be taken into account over large geographic scales;
   otherwise attempts to derive general patterns may well be strongly
   biased. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Annual changes in the behaviour and distribution of top predators at sea
   may be linked to environmental variability. Here we report, for the
   first time to our knowledge, the inter-annual (2007-2011) foraging
   ecology during the pre-laying period of female Cory's shearwaters
   Calonectris diomedea from Berlenga (Portugal), based on biotelemetry
   data. Our aim was to examine the degree of flexibility in the at-sea
   distribution, behaviour and habitat selection of foraging birds, and
   relate this with marine environmental stochasticity. Productivity
   proxies in the closer foraging areas decreased noticeably between 2007
   and 2011 (i.e. an increase of sea surface temperature and a decrease of
   primary productivity). Female Cory's shearwaters perceived the oceanic
   changes, and shifted their distribution to an area that could have the
   food resources required for egg formation. In 2011, in order to exploit
   the productive Grand Banks and Newfoundland Shelf domains, female Cory's
   shearwaters embarked on one of the largest foraging excursions of the
   pre-laying period when compared to other seabird species (nearly 4000
   km). The option to forage on such a distant area in 2011 decreased the
   females' body condition and reduced their hatching success, which may be
   interpreted as an adaptation to local productivity during this
   energetically highly demanding period to favour their own survival.
   Long-term monitoring of the foraging behaviour of top predators such as
   Cory's shearwaters in years to come may serve as a `sensitive' proxy to
   help understand the medium-to long-term effects of environmental
   stochasticity in marine ecological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Feline interstitial cystitis (FIC) is a chronic pain syndrome of
   domestic cats. Cats with FIC have chronic, recurrent lower urinary tract
   signs (LUTS) and other comorbid disorders that are exacerbated by
   stressors. The aim of this study was to evaluate behavioral and
   physiological responses of healthy cats and cats diagnosed with FIC
   after exposure to a five day stressor. Ten healthy cats and 18 cats with
   FIC were housed at The Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center
   (OSUVMC) vivarium. All cats were housed in enriched cages for at least
   one year prior to the experiment. Cats had daily play time and
   socialization outside of the cage, food treats and auditory enrichment.
   The daily husbandry schedule was maintained at a consistent time of day
   and cats were cared for by two familiar caretakers. During the test
   days, cats were exposed to multiple unpredictable stressors which
   included exposure to multiple unfamiliar caretakers, an inconsistent
   husbandry schedule, and discontinuation of play time, socialization,
   food treats, and auditory enrichment. Sickness behaviors (SB), including
   vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia or decreased food and water intake, fever,
   lethargy, somnolence, enhanced pain-like behaviors, decreased general
   activity, body care activities (grooming), and social interactions, were
   recorded daily. Blood samples were collected in the morning, before and
   after the stress period, for measurement of serum cortisol
   concentration, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils,
   neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and mRNA for the cytokines
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Overall, the short term stressors led to a
   significant increase in SB in both healthy cats and cats with FIC,
   whereas lymphopenia and N:L changes occurred only in FIC cats. Daily
   monitoring of cats for SB may be a noninvasive and reliable way to
   assess stress responses and overall welfare of cats housed in cages. (C)

Abstract = {{Evolutionary and life history perspectives allow a fuller understanding
   of both patterns of growth and development and variations in disease
   risk. Evolutionary processes act to ensure successful reproduction and
   not the preservation of health and longevity, and this entails
   trade-offs both between traits and across the life course. Developmental
   plasticity adjusts the developmental trajectory so that the phenotype in
   childhood and through peak reproduction will suit predicted
   environmental conditions - a capacity that may become maladaptive should
   early-life predictions be inaccurate. Bipedalism and consequent pelvic
   narrowing in humans have led to the evolution of secondary altricialism.
   Shorter inter-birth intervals enabled by appropriate social support
   structures have allowed increased fecundity/fitness. The age at puberty
   has fallen over the past two centuries, perhaps resulting from changes
   in maternal and infant health and nutrition. The timing of puberty is
   also advanced by conditions of high extrinsic mortality in
   hunter-gatherers and is reflected in developed countries where a poor or
   disadvantaged start to life may also accelerate maturation. The
   postpubertal individual is physically and psychosexually mature, but
   neural executive function only reaches full maturity in the third decade
   of life; this mismatch may account for increased adolescent morbidity
   and mortality in those with earlier pubertal onset. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Competition can greatly affect the food hoarding strategies of rodents

   we investigated food hoarding patterns of two sympatric rodent species,

   hoarding behavior under interspecific competition. The results showed
   that: (1) the buff-breasted rat larder hoarded seeds only, while Chinese
   white-bellied rat hoarded seeds in both larder and scatter forms: (2)
   two species of rodents both larder hoarded more seeds when competitors
   were present: and (3) the Chinese white-bellied rats adjusted their seed
   hoarding from scatter to larder when competitors were introduced, which
   reduced the seed availability. Therefore, we concluded that rodents
   would adjust their food hoarding strategy when interspecific competitors
   were present, and this may produce a different effect on the fate of
   seeds and the recruitment of plants.

Abstract = {{Low birthweight, a marker of an adverse in utero environment, is
   associated with cardiometabolic disease and brain disorders in
   adulthood. The adaptive changes made by the fetus in response to the
   intra-uterine environment result in permanent changes in physiology,
   structure and metabolism, a phenomenon termed early life programming.
   One of the key hypotheses to explain programming, namely over exposure
   of the developing fetus to glucocorticoids, was proposed nearly two
   decades ago, following the observation that the fetus was protected from
   high glucocorticoid levels in the mother by the actions of the placental
   barrier enzyme, 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts
   active glucocorticoids into inactive products. Numerous mechanistic
   studies in animal models have been carried out to test this hypothesis
   using manipulations to increase maternal glucocorticoids. Overall, these
   have resulted in offspring of lower birthweight, with an activated
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and an adverse metabolic
   profile and behavioural phenotype in adulthood.
   Altered glucocorticoid activity or action is a good candidate mechanism
   in humans to link low birthweight with cardiometabolic and brain
   disorders. We have carried out detailed studies in men and women showing
   that high levels of endogenous glucocorticoids, or treatment with
   exogenous glucocorticoids, is associated with an adverse metabolic
   profile, increased cardiovascular disease and altered mood and cognitive
   decline. Our laboratory carried out the first translational studies in
   humans to test the glucocorticoid hypothesis, firstly demonstrating in
   studies of adult men and women, that low birthweight was associated with
   high fasting cortisol levels. We went on to dissect the mechanisms
   underlying the high fasting cortisol, demonstrating activation of the
   HPA axis, with increased cortisol responses to stimulation with
   exogenous adrenocorticotrophin hormone, lack of habituation to the
   stress of venepuncture, and increased cortisol responses to psychosocial
   stress. We have developed new dynamic tests to dissect the mechanisms
   regulating HPA axis central negative feedback sensitivity in humans, and
   demonstrated that this may be altered in obesity, one component of the
   metabolic syndrome.
   There are now studies in humans demonstrating that high circulating
   levels of maternal cortisol during pregnancy correlate negatively with
   birthweight, suggesting that excess glucocorticoids can by-pass the
   placental barrier. Deficiencies in the barrier enzyme, potentially
   increasing fetal glucocorticoid exposure, can also arise in association
   with maternal stress, malnutrition and disease, and can be inhibited by
   consumption of liquorice, which contains glycyrrhizin, an HSD inhibitor.
   Importantly, studies in humans have now demonstrated that high maternal
   cortisol in pregnancy and/or inhibition of HSD2 are associated with
   programmed outcomes in childhood including higher blood pressure,
   behavioural disorders as well as altered brain structure. We are
   investigating this further, using novel magnetic resonance imaging
   techniques to study the developing fetal brain in utero.
   The translational studies in support of the glucocorticoid hypothesis,
   and demonstrating that glucocorticoids are both mediators and targets of
   programming, are exciting and raise the question of whether this
   information can be used to identify those individuals most at risk of
   later life disease. In a recent study we showed that alterations in DNA
   rnethylation at genes important in regulating cortisol levels, tissue
   glucocorticoid action, blood pressure and fetal growth, are present in
   adulthood in association with both early life parameters and
   cardiometabolic risk factors. These preliminary data add to the limited
   literature in humans indicating a persisting epigenetic link between
   early life events and subsequent disease risk. Such findings open novel
   avenues for further exploration of the contribution of glucocorticoids
   to later life disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many species in social groups make use of readily available, socially
   provided information for behaviours including predator avoidance, mate
   choice and foraging. Not only are actions imitated, but they may also be
   reapplied in variable future situations, suggesting an explicit
   knowledge of the purpose of the behaviours. Social learning thus enables
   animals to learn about their complex environments rapidly and
   efficiently, aiding survival. However, little is known of the processes
   underlying information transmission and the complexity of information
   that can be exchanged. We used shoals of guppies to investigate how
   animals decide which individual to copy, and the extent of information
   that can be transferred. Naive guppies followed the first fish to move.
   However, although the speed and accuracy of foraging increased
   significantly during training, the first fish to move was not always the
   trained (knowledgeable) guppy. No significant difference was found
   between the number of guppies entering areas of varying food quality,
   supporting the hypothesis that these fish learn foraging locations by
   following and suggesting that leaders forage without considering the
   reduced personal reward arising from sharing a low-quality patch with
   followers. Animals that learn by copying thus appear limited in the
   amount of information they can receive, highlighting a selection

Abstract = {{Trade-offs are inherent to alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), and
   identifying the costs and benefits of tactics is essential to
   understanding their evolution and maintenance within a population. Male
   horseshoe crabs exhibit two condition-dependent ARTs: males that are in
   better condition arrive on spawning beaches attached to a female, while
   males in poorer condition join spawning pairs as satellites and engage
   in sperm competition. Previous research has identified several benefits
   to the attached tactic, but the costs are less well understood. We
   examined a previously uninvestigated potential cost to the attached male
   tactic: nutritional stress caused by a restricted ability to feed. We
   found that field-caught attached males produced 57\% less faeces in a 12
   h period than satellite males, and had 2.5 times emptier digestive
   tracts than satellite males. We further examined this cost using stable
   isotopes because nutritionally stressed animals are predicted to have
   higher delta N-15 levels. We found that field-caught attached males had
   higher delta N-15 values than satellite males. However, higher delta
   N-15 values could result from nutritional stress or from feeding on
   higher trophic levels. We tested this experimentally and found that
   starved animals had higher post-treatment delta N-15 values compared to
   animals that were fed. Furthermore, the digestive tracts of field-caught
   attached males contained three times more sea grass (lower tropic levels
   have lower delta N-15 values) than satellite males. These findings mean

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between
   temperament in Australian infants aged 2-7 months and feeding practices
   of their first-time mothers (n = 698). Associations between feeding
   practices and beliefs (Infant Feeding Questionnaire) and infant
   temperament (easy-difficult continuous scale from the Short Temperament
   Scale for Infants) were tested using linear and binary logistic
   regression models adjusted for a comprehensive range of covariates.
   Mothers of infants with a more difficult temperament reported a lower
   awareness of infant cues, were more likely to use food to calm and
   reported high concern about overweight and underweight. The covariate
   maternal depression score largely mirrored these associations. Infant
   temperament may be an important variable to consider in future research
   on the prevention of childhood obesity. In practice, mothers of
   temperamentally difficult infants may need targeted feeding advice to
   minimise the adoption of undesirable feeding practices. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and
   eating disorder not otherwise specified, are psychiatric disorders with
   physical complications. Several factors may contribute to the onset of
   anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, including a familial
   predisposition to these disorders as well as individual personality
   characteristics. Dissatisfaction with body shape and an overwhelming
   desire to be thin are considered as risk factors for the development of
   eating disorders. Skin signs are the expression of the medical
   consequences of starvation, vomiting, abuse of drugs, such as laxatives
   and diuretics, and psychiatric morbidity. They include xerosis,
   lanugolike body hair, telogen effluvium, carotenoderma, acne,
   hyperpigmentation, seborrheic dermatitis, acrocyanosis, perniosis,
   petechiae, livedo reticularis, interdigital intertrigo, paronychia,
   acquired striae distensae, and acral coldness. The most characteristic
   cutaneous sign of vomiting is Russell sign (knuckle calluses). Symptoms
   due to laxative or diuretic abuse include adverse reactions to drugs.
   Symptoms due to psychiatric morbidity (artefacta) include the
   consequences of self-induced trauma. The role of the dermatologist in

Abstract = {{Membrane nanotubes (MNTs) are newly discovered cellular extensions that
   are either blind-ended or can connect widely separated cells. They have
   predominantly been investigated in cultured isolated cells, however,
   previously we were the first group to demonstrate the existence of these
   structures in vivo in intact mammalian tissues. We previously
   demonstrated the frequency of both cell-cell or bridging MNTs and
   blind-ended MNTs was greatest between major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) class II+ cells during corneal injury or TLR ligand-mediated
   inflammation. The present study aimed to further explore the dynamics of
   MNT formation and their size, presence in another tissue, the dura

   infection of the murine cornea. Confocal live cell imaging of
   myeloid-derived cells in inflamed corneal explants from Cx(3)cr1(GFP)

   rate of 15.5 mu m/min. This observation contrasts with previous studies
   that demonstrated that in vitro these structures originate from
   cell-cell contacts. Conditions that promote formation of MNTs include
   inflammation in vivo and cell stress due to serum starvation ex vivo.
   Herpes simplex virus-1 infection did not cause a significant increase in
   MNT numbers in myeloid cells in the cornea above that observed in injury

Abstract = {{The life history of tropical birds differs from that of their temperate
   counterparts by late start of reproduction, small clutch sizes, and high
   rates of adult survival. Thus, tropical species should have greater
   residual reproductive value than temperate species. Therefore, tropical
   birds can be predicted to take smaller risks than closely related
   temperate birds in order not to jeopardize their prospects of survival,
   which is the single most important component of fitness, and which is
   greater in tropical than in temperate species. We estimated flight
   distances as a measure of risk-taking behavior of common species of
   birds for populations living in tropical areas in China (mainly Haitian)
   and in temperate Europe (mainly Denmark and France), predicting that
   flight distances should be longer in tropical than in temperate
   populations, and that the difference in flight distance between these 2
   environments should be positively correlated with the difference in
   clutch size. Mean flight distance was more than twice as large in
   tropical compared with temperate populations for 25 pairs of taxa. The
   difference in flight distance between tropical and temperate taxa
   decreased with the difference in clutch size between the 2 environments.
   These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tropical birds
   take smaller risks than closely related temperate taxa to minimize the
   risk of early death due to predation.}},

Abstract = {{A stronger focus on natural mortality may be required to better
   understand contemporary changes in fish life histories and behaviour and
   their responses to anthropogenic drivers. Firstly, natural mortality is
   the selection under which fish evolved in the first place, so a
   theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is
   needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only
   be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might
   need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality
   being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that
   natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in
   some fished stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality
   most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to
   another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We
   therefore analyse a model for evolution of fish life histories and
   behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies
   are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into five
   different components, each specified as the outcome of individual traits
   and ecological tradeoffs: a fixed baseline mortality; size-dependent
   predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a fixed mortality when
   sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment.
   The analysis is repeated with and without fishing. Each component of
   natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies.
   Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive
   mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on
   life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food
   availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal
   strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how
   expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable
   depending on the type of mortality changed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Antipredator behaviour is an important fitness component in most
   animals. A co-evolutionary history between predator and prey is
   important for prey to respond adaptively to predation threats. When
   non-native predator species invade new areas, native prey may not
   recognise them or may lack effective antipredator defences. However,
   responses to novel predators can be facilitated by chemical cues from
   the predators' diet. The red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is a
   widespread invasive predator in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula,
   where it preys upon native anuran tadpoles. In a laboratory experiment
   we studied behavioural antipredator defences (alterations in activity
   level and spatial avoidance of predator) of nine anurans in response to
   P. clarkii chemical cues, and compared them with the defences towards a
   native predator, the larval dragonfly Aeshna sp. To investigate how
   chemical cues from consumed conspecifics shape the responses, we raised
   tadpoles with either a tadpole-fed or starved crayfish, or dragonfly
   larva, or in the absence of a predator. Five species significantly
   altered their behaviour in the presence of crayfish, and this was
   largely mediated by chemical cues from consumed conspecifics. In the
   presence of dragonflies, most species exhibited behavioural defences and
   often these did not require the presence of cues from predation events.
   Responding to cues from consumed conspecifics seems to be a critical
   factor in facilitating certain behavioural responses to novel exotic
   predators. This finding can be useful for predicting antipredator
   responses to invasive predators and help directing conservation efforts
   to the species at highest risk.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Pregnancy is a time in which food choice is of particular importance.
   Trust in the food supply and those who regulate it is receiving greater
   acknowledgement because of the influence of trust on food choice. No
   prior investigation into pregnant women and food trust has been
   conducted.
   Aims
   This paper identifies factors that determine the nature and extent of
   pregnant women's trust in food; sources of information which influence
   pregnant women's food choices; and how trust impacts on pregnant women's
   food choices.
   Method
   In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 pregnant women; nine were
   pregnant with their first child and four were in their second or
   subsequent pregnancy.
   Results
   Food choices of pregnant women were predominantly influenced by
   nutrition and perceived quality of food. Risktaking behaviour, such as
   the consumption of foods considered high risk during pregnancy, was
   common amongst participants. The sample was characterised by a
   dependence on expert information, limited reflexivity in relation to
   food safety, and contradictory practice such as risk-taking behaviours
   in regard to high risk foods were observed.
   Conclusion
   Further research is needed to confirm findings in this study. Research
   into consumption of high-risk foods and the information received from
   healthcare providers would be useful in creating a clearer understanding
   of whether provision of information is sufficient in communicating risks
   and promoting a healthy pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Relations between the human and hi-tech worlds, even until recently
   considered the subject of science fiction, are taking a more real shape
   and becoming the focus of expert discussions. Some specialists suggest
   that in the future machines can become the principal creator of new
   technologies and race far ahead of humanity. However, emerging
   technologies for human enhancement offer new possibilities for humans to
   remain competitive against machines and to acquire more advanced
   physical and mental capacities. These techniques are interdisciplinary,
   drawing primarily on advances in medicine, pharmacology, nutrition,
   mobile communications, neuroscience and cognitive sciences.
   This paper provides examples of such developments, analyzes their
   contribution to the expansion of human capabilities and, consequently,
   implications for the future working environment. It addresses ethical
   issues and risks associated with human enhancement technologies, in
   particular, the emergence of the new social divide - between the users
   of such technologies and people lacking access to them. Finally, it
   discusses some wild cards that may cause future surprises and shocks,
   i.e. machines that can control a human-excluded world, a virtual level
   of human life that dominates real life. The author notes that such
   conditions will require rethinking established views of personality,
   human responsibility and mutual obligations that will help the
   establishment of new behavioral patterns.}},

Title = {{Plasticity of collective behavior in a nomadic early spring folivore}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Collective behavior in the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria)
   meets the thermal constraints of being an early spring folivore, but
   introduces other constraints in food choice. These are minimized by
   state-dependent, inter-individual, and ontogenetic variations in
   responses to social cues. Forest tent caterpillars use pheromone trails
   and tactile communication among colony members to stay together during
   foraging. At the group level, these rules lead to cohesive synchronized
   collective nomadic foraging, in which the colony travels en masse
   between feeding and resting sites. This paper proposes that synchronized
   collective locomotion prevents individuals from becoming separated from
   the colony and hence permits them to reap the advantages of group
   living, notably collective basking to increase their body temperature
   above ambient and collective defense against natural enemies. However,
   this cohesive behavior also implies conservative foraging, and colonies
   can become trapped on poor food sources. High fidelity to pheromone
   trails leads to strong amplification of an initial choice, such that
   colonies seldom abandon the first food source contacted, even if a
   better one is nearby. The risk of this trapping is modulated both by
   consistent inter-individual variations in exploratory behavior and by
   inner state. Colonies consisting of active-phenotype or protein-deprived
   individuals that explore more-off trails exhibit greater collective
   flexibility in foraging. An ontogenetic shift toward more independent
   movement occurs as caterpillars grow. This leads to colony break-up as
   the season advances. Selection pressures facing older caterpillars favor
   solitary living more than in the earlier instars. Caterpillars respond
   to this predictably changing environment by altering their behavioral
   rules as they grow.}},

   increase in energy intake observed while practicing sedentary activities
   is not related to increases in appetite or hunger sensations. As opposed

   appetite and promote the maintenance of a healthy body weight. A
   U-shaped relationship has been noted between sleep duration and
   adiposity indicators, suggesting that both short- and long-duration

   that short-duration sleepers having a high disinhibition eating behavior
   trait are more at risk of gaining weight over time compared to
   short-duration sleepers having a low disinhibition eating behavior
   trait. In summary, it is important to make the distinction between
   `sleep' and `sedentary activities' when assessing their effects on
   health-related indicators. While most sedentary activities promote a
   positive energy balance, which may ultimately lead to weight gain over
   time, adequate sleep is rather associated with body weight stability and

Abstract = {{Only little is known about behaviour and stress responses in horses with
   gastric ulceration, despite the high prevalence of this condition. Our
   objectives in the present study was to (i) describe the severity of
   gastric ulceration in horses, housed under relatively standardised
   conditions, and (ii) to investigate whether horses with severe glandular
   gastric ulceration have increased baseline and response concentration of
   stress hormones and behave differently than control horses. We
   investigated stomachs of 96 horses at one stud, and compared an ulcer
   group (n = 30; with severe lesions in the glandular mucosa) to paired
   controls (n = 30; free from gastric ulcers). Baseline and response
   concentrations of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM), heart rate and
   behaviour were measured in a novel object test (NOT, Day 1) and
   behaviour during postponed feeding (PF, Day 2). Glandular lesions
   occurred in 55.2\% and non-glandular lesions in 40.6\% of the horses.
   The amount of starch in the feed (P=0.006) and paternal stallion
   (P=0.031) influenced ulceration in the non-glandular region only; it
   should be noted that our study does not allow for separating hereditary
   from environmental influences, as offspring may be e.g. trained
   differently dependent on breeding line. Ulcer horses pawed more (P <
   0.001) and ate quicker (P=0.050) during PF. Although displayed by ulcers
   horses only during PF, we failed to demonstrate a significant
   association between glandular gastric ulceration and
   crib-biting/weaving; the total number of horses with these types of
   abnormal behaviour was low (n = 5). Behaviour and heart rate did not
   differ between groups in the NOT. Baseline concentration of FCM was
   similar (P=0.79), however, ulcer horses responded stronger to novelty
   than controls (26\% higher FCM; P=0.018). We conclude that the
   prevalence of gastric ulcers was high, and our results suggest different
   factors affecting ulceration in the glandular versus the non-glandular
   region of the horse stomach. Obvious external signs (e.g. poor body
   condition) identifying ulcer horses were absent. Horses with severe
   glandular ulcers had a higher stress hormone response to novelty, thus
   they were more stress sensitive. Consequently, management evoking stress
   in horses should be reduced to dampen the development of glandular
   ulceration, or to protect horses with this condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{34-43}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{The peptide hormone ghrelin regulates a variety of eating behaviors. Not
   only does it potently increase intake of freely-available food, but it
   also shifts food preference toward diets rich in fat, enhances operant
   responding for food rewards, and induces conditioned place preference
   for food rewards. Here, we postulated that ghrelin also enables
   cue-potentiated feeding, in which eating is enhanced upon presentation
   of a food-conditioned stimulus. To test this hypothesis, a novel
   cue-potentiated feeding protocol adapted for use in mice was designed
   and validated, and then the effects of pharmacologic ghrelin receptor
   (GHSR) antagonism and GHSR transcriptional blockade (as occurs in
   GHSR-null mice) were assessed. Sated C57BL/6J mice indeed demonstrated
   cue-potentiated intake of grain-based pellets specifically upon
   presentation of a positive conditioned stimulus (CS+) but not a negative
   conditioned stimulus (CS). Treatment with a GHSR antagonist blocked
   potentiated feeding in sated C57BL/6J mice in response to the CS+. In
   contrast, while GHSR-null mice also lacked a potentiation of feeding
   specifically in response to the CS+, they displayed an enhanced intake
   of pellets in response to both the positive and negative conditioned
   stimuli. The pattern of immediate early gene expression within the
   basolateral amygdala - a brain region previously linked to
   cue-potentiated feeding - paralleled the observed behavior of these
   mice, suggesting uncharacteristic activation of the amygdala in response
   to negative conditioned stimuli in GHSR-null mice as compared to

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species differ consistently in risky actions.
   Such `animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural
   flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that
   between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve
   if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with
   high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should
   behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower
   expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness
   expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky
   behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested
   this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed
   adjust their `exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour,
   to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus
   major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival
   probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking
   behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability.
   We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic
   effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive
   personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key
   prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history
   trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution
   of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future
   fitness expectations.}},

   a newly discovered cell-cell interaction whereby myxobacteria exchange
   their outer membrane (OM) proteins and lipids. The mechanism of OM
   transfer requires physical contact between aligned cells on a hard
   surface and is apparently mediated by OM fusion. The TraA and TraB
   proteins are required in both donor and recipient cells for transfer,
   suggesting bidirectional exchange, and TraA is thought to serve as a

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of foraging animals at a given time
   simultaneously depends on (1) exogenous environmental variables such as
   resource availability and abiotic habitat characteristics, and (2) the
   endogenous variable social aggregation made up of the opposing
   mechanisms of conspecific attraction and repulsion. We developed an
   exogenous environment-social aggregation model to analyse the spatial
   distributions of six abundant shorebird species in the Dutch Wadden Sea
   at resolutions of 150 x 150, 200 x 200 and 250 x 250 m. We used these
   resolutions to check the robustness of the estimates to the modifiable
   areal unit problem. We estimated the model parameters by spatial
   autoregression. This approach enables, among others, estimation of the
   direct and indirect effects of an exogenous environmental variable on
   animal density. The former is given by the regression coefficient and
   the latter, which is due to the amplification of the direct effect by
   social aggregation, by the spatial multiplier. At all resolution levels
   and for all species, the explanatory power of social aggregation,
   measured by Nagelkerke R-2, was larger than the combined contribution of

Abstract = {{Social learning, whereby animals learn from others, mediates the spread
   of information through social networks. To make this process adaptive,
   animals should be selective with respect to when and whom to copy. The
   cost of decision making can be curbed by cognitive biases favouring
   particular categories of individuals. Such model biases are well
   documented, but few, if any, experimental studies have addressed
   potential developmental causes of this variation. We therefore tested
   whether and how the postnatal environment affected social-learning
   preferences in a known social learner the zebra finch, Taeniopygia
   guttata. Birds from experimentally manipulated brood sizes, a treatment
   known to affect adult phenotypic quality in this species, were tested in
   an established observer-demonstrator paradigm. Naive observers could
   watch unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics feed from differently coloured
   novel feeders. When subsequently allowed to choose between identical
   feeders, postnatal conditions (=rearing brood size) had strong effects

Abstract = {{The unrelenting rise in global rates of non-communicable disease has
   necessitated a thorough re-evaluation of the current use of adult- and
   lifestyle-based strategies to curb the growing epidemic. There is a
   rapidly emerging set of epidemiological, experimental and clinical data
   suggesting that developmental factors play a considerable role in
   determining individual disease risk later in life. This phenomenon is
   known as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD).
   Developmental factors, such as maternal and paternal nutrition,
   gestational diabetes mellitus, and even the normative range of
   developmental experiences, may evoke the processes of developmental
   plasticity which enable an organism to change its developmental
   trajectory in response to environmental cues. However in the event of a
   mismatch between the early and mature environment, such anticipatory
   responses may become maladaptive and lead to elevated risk of disease.
   The evo-devo and eco-evo-devo framework for DOHaD has more recently been
   supported by mechanistic insights enabled by rapid advances in
   epigenetic research. Increasing evidence suggests that developmental
   plasticity may be effected by epigenetically mediated modulation of the
   expression of specific genes. These mechanisms include DNA methylation,
   histone modifications and noncoding RNA activity. A growing number of
   animal studies also point towards the transgenerational inheritance of
   epigenetic marks, which may have implications for the perpetuation of

Abstract = {{A species may modify its relative habitat use with changing

   Functional responses in habitat selection are expected to occur when
   animals experience trade-offs influencing their habitat selection, but
   only a few studies to date have explicitly linked functional responses
   to the underlying trade-offs faced by the animals. We used data from 39
   female moose fitted with GPS telemetry collars in two nearby study areas
   in Canada to investigate if moose (1) were faced with a food/cover
   trade-off in habitat selection, as typically acknowledged in the
   literature, and (2) showed a functional response in their use of
   food/cover-rich habitats. We also examined how habitat selection
   patterns varied seasonally, and between study areas. The occurrence of
   functional responses varied strongly between study areas, and could not
   always be related to a measurable food/cover trade-off. Functional
   responses were observed more often in the study area where the
   environmental conditions were more severe (colder temperatures, higher
   precipitations, and lower food availability). Selection coefficients
   were also less variable among individuals in that study area, suggesting
   that severe environmental conditions may constrain individuals to a few
   selection tactics and promote the development of functional responses.
   Moose reacted to the availability of different habitat types in
   different seasons, reflecting the changing trade-offs faced by the
   animals. We found considerable behavioral differences between
   individuals from two adjacent study areas, and therefore recommend
   caution when extrapolating habitat selection results. We advocate for
   the wider use of functional responses to identify critical habitats for
   a species from a management or conservation perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Agonistic behavior may influence the dispersal of species and spatial
   distribution of individuals within a population. The Mediterranean gecko
   Hemidactylus turcicus was used to test 2 hypotheses: 1) adult behavior
   differs in responses to conspecifics and resource limitations; and 2)
   juvenile behavior is affected by visual, chemical, and tactile adult
   male cues. I quantified behavioral responses of males to different
   levels of food quality, availability of retreat sites, and the presence
   of a resident male. Aggression was significantly more prevalent in the
   presence of a conspecific male regardless of resource availability. To
   test the 2nd hypothesis, I observed juvenile responses to chemosensory
   cues of either a confined or non-confined adult male. Both visual and
   chemosensory cues combined, rather than chemical cues alone influenced
   juvenile responses. Juveniles also exhibited sensory behavior
   (tongue-flicking) upon entering a novel environment, indicating that
   chemical mediation may be sufficient to impact behavior. Results of
   these contests illustrate the importance of chemical communication in
   providing information which influences behavioral responses and suggests
   a role for self and mutual assessments during intraspecific encounters.
   The outcome of competitive encounters may heavily rely on information
   collected via chemical cues and may ultimately regulate aggression by
   informing individuals about whether or not to fight and thus adhere to
   the confines of social dominance within the species.}},

   gradients of temperature, food, oxygen and light, in the presence and

   hypolimnion if the food was concentrated in a deep-water maximum. 4.
   However, oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion, representing an additional
   cost, prevented Daphnia from completely exploiting the hypolimnetic food
   maximum. Consequently, the proportion dwelling in the hypolimnion was
   larger if oxygen was not limiting. 5. Fish predation had an overwhelming
   effect, driving Daphnia into the hypolimnion under all experimental
   conditions. If permitted by oxygen availability, Daphnia used the whole
   hypolimnion, but oxygen depletion reduced their possible habitat to the
   upper hypolimnion with oxygen concentrations above c. 0.7 mg L-1. As

   Start preschoolers: the growing healthy study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nearly one in five 4-year-old children in the United States
   are obese, with low-income children almost twice as likely to be obese
   as their middle/upper-income peers. Few obesity prevention programs for
   low-income preschoolers and their parents have been rigorously tested,
   and effects are modest. We are testing a novel obesity prevention
   program for low-income preschoolers built on the premise that children
   who are better able to self-regulate in the face of psychosocial
   stressors may be less likely to eat impulsively in response to stress.
   Enhancing behavioral self-regulation skills in low-income children may
   be a unique and important intervention approach to prevent childhood
   obesity.
   Methods/design: The Growing Healthy study is a randomized controlled
   trial evaluating two obesity prevention interventions in 600 low-income
   preschoolers attending Head Start, a federally-funded preschool program
   for low-income children. Interventions are delivered by community-based,
   nutrition-education staff partnering with Head Start. The first
   intervention (n = 200), Preschool Obesity Prevention Series (POPS),
   addresses evidence-based obesity prevention behaviors for preschool-aged
   children and their parents. The second intervention (n = 200) comprises
   POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an
   evidence-based approach to improving self-regulation among
   preschool-aged children. The comparison condition (n = 200) is Usual
   Head Start Exposure. We hypothesize that POPS will yield positive
   effects compared to Usual Head Start, and that the combined intervention
   (POPS + IYS) addressing behaviors well-known to be associated with
   obesity risk, as well as self-regulatory capacity, will be most
   effective in preventing excessive increases in child adiposity indices
   (body mass index, skinfold thickness). We will evaluate additional child
   outcomes using parent and teacher reports and direct assessments of
   food-related self-regulation. We will also gather process data on
   intervention implementation, including fidelity, attendance, engagement,
   and satisfaction.
   Discussion: The Growing Healthy study will shed light on associations
   between self-regulation skills and obesity risk in low-income
   preschoolers. If the project is effective in preventing obesity, results
   can also provide critical insights into how best to deliver obesity
   prevention programming to parents and children in a community-based
   setting like Head Start in order to promote better health among at-risk
   children.}},

Title = {{Early life opportunities for prevention of diabetes in low and middle
   income countries}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The global burden of diabetes and other non-communicable
   diseases is rising dramatically worldwide and is causing a double poor
   health burden in low-and middle-income countries. Early life influences
   play an important part in this scenario because maternal lifestyle and
   conditions such as gestational diabetes and obesity affect the risk of
   diabetes in the next generation. This indicates important periods during
   the lifecourse when interventions could have powerful affects in
   reducing incidence of non-communicable diseases. However, interventions
   to promote diet and lifestyle in prospective parents before conception
   have not received sufficient attention, especially in low-and
   middle-income countries undergoing socio-economic transition.
   Discussion: Interventions to produce weight loss in adults or to reduce
   weight gain in pregnancy have had limited success and might be too late
   to produce the largest effects on the health of the child and his/her
   later risk of non-communicable diseases. A very important factor in the
   prevention of the developmental component of diabetes risk is the
   physiological state in which the parents enter pregnancy. We argue that
   the most promising strategy to improve prospective parents' body
   composition and lifestyle is the promotion of health literacy in
   adolescents. Multiple but integrated forms of community-based
   interventions that focus on nutrition, physical activity, family
   planning, breastfeeding and infant feeding practices are needed. They
   need to address the wider social economic context in which adolescents
   live and to be linked with existing public health programmes in sexual
   and reproductive health and maternal and child health initiatives.
   Summary: Interventions aimed at ensuring a healthy body composition,
   diet and lifestyle before pregnancy offer a most effective solution in
   many settings, especially in low-and middle-income countries undergoing
   socio-economic transition. Preparing a mother, her partner and her
   future child for ``the 1000 days{''}, whether from planned or unplanned
   conception would break the cycle of risk and demonstrate benefit in the
   shortest possible time. Such interventions will be particularly
   important in adolescents and young women in disadvantaged groups and can
   improve the physiological status of the fetus as well as reduce the
   prevalence of pregnancy conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus
   which both predispose to non-communicables diseases in both the mother
   and her child. Pre-conception interventions require equipping
   prospective parents with the necessary knowledge and skills to make
   healthy lifestyle choices for themselves and their children. Addressing
   the promotion of such health literacy in parents-to-be in low-and
   middle-income countries requires a wider social perspective. It requires
   a range of multisectoral agencies to work together and could be linked
   to the issues of women's empowerment, to reproductive health, to
   communicable disease prevention and to the Millennium Development Goals

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mercury in the Arctic is an important environmental and human health
   issue. The reliance of Northern Peoples on traditional foods, such as
   marine mammals, for subsistence means that they are particularly at risk
   from mercury exposure. The cycling of mercury in Arctic marine systems
   is reviewed here, with emphasis placed on the key sources, pathways and
   processes which regulate mercury levels in marine food webs and
   ultimately the exposure of human populations to this contaminant. While
   many knowledge gaps exist limiting our ability to make strong
   conclusions, it appears that the long-range transport of mercury from
   Asian emissions is an important source of atmospheric Hg to the Arctic
   and that mercury methylation resulting in monomethylmercury production
   (an organic form of mercury which is both toxic and bioaccumulated) in
   Arctic marine waters is the principal source of mercury incorporated
   into food webs. Mercury concentrations in biological organisms have
   increased since the onset of the industrial age and are controlled by a
   combination of abiotic factors (e.g., monomethylmercury supply), food
   web dynamics and structure, and animal behavior (e.g., habitat selection
   and feeding behavior). Finally, although some Northern Peoples have high
   mercury concentrations of mercury in their blood and hair, harvesting
   and consuming traditional foods have many nutritional, social, cultural
   and physical health benefits which must be considered in risk management
   and communication. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the
   energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource
   depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between
   individuals of different personality types. We tested whether
   individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus,
   forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking
   behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel
   object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment,
   we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites.
   During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to
   exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel
   object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these
   individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively
   indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start
   feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to
   nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk
   taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk.
   Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing
   field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between
   individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness
   measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a
   foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this
   personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual
   differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of
   variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using
   optimality approaches. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Decision making is vital to the fitness of all animals, with many social
   species making consensus decisions that require efficient communication.
   Chemical signals are the most important tools for many animals, and are
   used notably by social insects in a wide variety of contexts, from
   foraging for food to recognition of nestmates. However, chemical cues
   may be biosynthetically limited and costly to produce, making their use
   in multiple contexts potentially beneficial. In this study we examined
   the role of foraging pheromones during nest migrations in the Pharaoh's
   ant, Monomorium pharaonis. Using a Y-shaped bridge apparatus, we tested
   whether ants would prefer migrating to a novel nest site along branches
   coated with attractive foraging pheromones rather than to a nest site
   reached via a control branch. We found that ants preferred to migrate to
   nest sites reached via branches with attractive foraging pheromones, and
   that there were more queens and workers in those nests at the end of the
   migration than in nests at the end of control branches. The results show
   that attractive foraging pheromones are utilized during nest migrations
   in the Pharaoh's ant, highlighting the evolutionary pressure to use
   signals in a parsimonious manner to improve communication during
   decision making. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The influence of ecology on the development of behavioral traditions in
   animals is controversial, particularly for chimpanzees (Pan
   troglodytes), for which it is difficult to rule out environmental
   influences as a cause of widely observed community-specific behavioral
   differences. Here, we investigated 3 potential scenarios that could
   explain the natural variation in a key extractive tool behavior,
   ``fluid-dip,{''} among several communities of chimpanzees of the Pan
   troglodytes schweinfurthii subspecies in Uganda. We compared data from
   previous behavioral ecological studies, field experiments, and long-term
   records of chimpanzee tool-using behavior. We focused on the quality of
   the available food, dietary preferences, and tool sets of 5 different
   communities, and carried out a standardized field experiment to test
   systematically for the presence of fluid-dip in 4 of these communities.
   Our results revealed major differences in habitat, available diet, and
   tool use behavior between geographically close communities. However,
   these differences in ecology and feeding behavior failed to explain the
   differences in tool use across communities. We conclude that ecological
   variables may lead both to innovation and loss of behavioral traditions,
   while contributing little to their transmission within the community.
   Instead, as soon as a behavioral tradition is established,
   sociocognitive factors likely play a key maintenance role as long as the
   ecological conditions do not change sufficiently for the tradition to be
   abandoned.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that the establishment of invasive-fish populations
   depends on the ability of introduced individuals to adapt to
   environmental conditions in the invaded ecosystem, including the ability
   to feed on diverse, locally available prey resources. Furthermore, the
   current invasive-biology paradigm postulates that having a
   generalist-food habit is key to the successful invasion of a novel
   community by exotic species. This study investigated how the invasive
   pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, has succeeded in establishing
   exotic populations in Florida, USA despite having a feeding apparatus
   that is characteristic of a specialized piscivore (i.e., fish-eating
   fish). Pike killifish collected from their point of introduction in
   south Florida were (1) filmed using high speed video while feeding on
   live fish-and shrimp-prey to determine whether prey type affects
   prey-capture kinematics and then (2) subjected to a prey-selectivity
   experiment to determine which prey type (live fish or shrimp) the
   invasive pike killifish eats when both prey are available in the
   environment. Results indicated that (1) prey-capture kinematics were not
   affected by prey type, indicating that consumption of fish and shrimp
   prey was accomplished using a stereotypical feeding repertoire, and (2)
   pike killifish consumed fish and shrimp when both prey were available in
   the feeding environment. It is concluded that the invasive pike
   killifish has the ability to feed on alternative, locally available prey
   using its piscivorous feeding functional morphology and prey-capture
   kinematics. This study contributes a new perspective to our
   understanding of the mechanisms that underlie success of exotic fishes
   in invaded communities. That is, the ability of a
   functional-morphological specialist to utilize stereotypical
   prey-capture kinematics (= behavior) in consuming alternative, locally
   available prey types (= dietary flexibility) contributes to the
   establishment of invasive populations. It is evident that these
   functional specialists are not constrained in their diet, thus, enabling
   them dietary flexibility and enhancing their invasive potential.}},

Abstract = {{Dropping off is considered an anti-predator behavior for aphids since
   previous studies have shown that it reduces the risk of predation.
   However, little attention is paid to dropping behavior triggered by
   other external stresses such as daytime high temperatures which are
   predicted to become more frequent in the context of climate warming.
   Here we defined a new parameter, drop-off temperature (DOT), to describe
   the critical temperature at which an aphid drops off its host plant when
   the ambient temperature increases gradually and slowly. Detailed studies
   were conducted to reveal effects of short-term acclimation (temperature,
   exposure time at high-temperature and starvation) on DOT of an aphid
   species. Sitobion avenae. Our objectives were to test if the aphids
   dropped off host plant to avoid high temperatures and how short-term
   acclimation affected the aphids' dropping behavior in response to heat
   stress. We suggest that dropping is a behavioral thermoregulation to
   avoid heat stress, since aphids started to move before they dropped off
   and the dropped aphids were still able to control their muscles prior to
   knockdown. The adults starved for 12 h had higher DOT values than those
   that were unstarved or starved for 6 h, and there was a trade-off
   between behavioral thermoregulation and energy acquisition. Higher
   temperatures and longer exposure times at high temperatures
   significantly lowered the aphids' DOT, suggested that the aphids avoid
   heat stress by dropping when exposed to high temperatures. Climate
   warming may therefore increase the aphids' dropping probabilities and
   consequently affect the aphids' individual development and population
   growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible changes in how readily animals fight can be explained in
   terms of adaptive responses to differences in the costs and benefits of

   number of questions, including why animals are consistent with respect
   to this trait, why aggressiveness is often linked to general risk
   taking, and why aggressive and nonaggressive animals often coexist
   within a population. In fish, different levels of aggressiveness bring
   several direct fitness-related consequences, such as when aggressive
   individuals monopolize a limited food supply and grow fast. They also
   bring indirect consequences, such as when aggressive fish are more
   susceptible to predation and when they require a larger respiratory
   surface to service a higher metabolic rate. Fitness consequences of
   aggressiveness are often context dependent, with aggressive fish tending
   to do well in simple, predictable conditions but not in complex, less
   predictable conditions. The diverse, context-dependent consequences of
   aggression mean that aggressive and nonaggressive fish flourish in
   different conditions and explain in general terms why these behavioral
   phenotypes often coexist. There are a number of candidate evolutionary
   frameworks for explaining why individual differences in aggressiveness
   are often, but not always, consistent over time and often, but not

Abstract = {{Elk (Cervus elaphus) are known to shift habitat use in response to
   environmental modifications, including those associated with various
   forms of energy development. The specific behavioral responses
   underlying these trends, however, have not been effectively studied. To
   investigate such effects, we examined elk response to habitat alteration
   near natural gas wells in Las Animas County, Colorado, USA in 2008-2010.
   We created 10 1-ha openings in forests adjacent to 10 operating natural
   gas wells by removing standing timber in 2008, with concomitant
   establishment of 10 1-ha control sites adjacent to the same wells. On
   each site, we estimated elk use, indexed by pellet density, before and
   after timber removal. Concurrently, we measured plant production and
   cover, nutritional quality, species composition and biomass removed by
   elk and other large herbivores. Species richness and diversity,
   graminoid and forb cover, and graminoid and forb biomass increased on
   cut sites following tree removal. Differences were greater in 2010 than
   in 2009, and elk and deer removed more plant biomass in 2010 than 2009.
   Elk use of cut sites was 37 \% lower than control sites in 2009, but 46
   \% higher in 2010. The initially lower use of cut sites may be
   attributable to lack of winter forage on these sites caused by timber
   removal and associated surface modification. The increased use of cut
   sites in 2010 suggested that elk possessed the behavioral capacity, over
   time, to exploit enhanced forage resources in the proximity of habitat
   modifications and human activity associated with maintenance of

Abstract = {{Taxonomic investigations of the Delias mysis (Fabricius, 1775) complex
   from northern Australia indicate two additional species in the
   Australian fauna: Delias aestiva Butler, 1897 stat. rev. and Delias lara
   (Boisduval, 1836). The latter species, which is illustrated from
   Australia for the first time, was until recently known under the name
   Delias mysis onca Fruhstorfer, 1910. Evidence from adult morphology
   (male genitalia), colour pattern of the adult and immature stages,
   behaviour, and ecology indicates substantial phenotypic divergence
   between D.?aestiva and D.?mysis. Within Australian limits, all three
   taxa are allopatric: D aestiva is endemic to the Top End, Northen
   Territory, D.?mysis mysis is restricted to northern and north-eastern
   Queensland, whereas Delias?lara lara is known only from three specimens
   from the Torres Strait islands, Queensland. Delias aestiva is perhaps
   the most remarkable member of the complex and indeed the genus, breeding
   in tropical mangrove habitats in coastal estuarine areas where the
   larvae specialize on mature foliage of the tree Excoecaria ovalis Endl.
   (Euphorbiaceae). This host preference is novel given the general
   tendency of Delias to feed on hemiparasitic plants in the order
   Santalales (Loranthaceae, Santalaceae and Viscaceae). Under laboratory
   conditions, however, larvae successfully completed development on the
   mistletoe genera Amyema, Dendrophthoe and Decaisnina (all Loranthaceae)
   with no significant reduction in larval survival. These findings,
   together with phylogenetic hypotheses of the Aporiina and Delias,
   indicate a recent evolutionary host shift from Loranthaceae to
   Euphorbiaceae. The foliage of Excoecaria produces toxic latex, which is
   composed of a variety of secondary plant compounds, including
   diterpenoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids and phorbol esters. The mechanism
   of detoxification has not been established, although the larvae of
   D.?aestiva are gregarious, regurgitate fluid as part of their chemical
   defence, and the adults are highly aposematic. Adults are seasonal,
   being chiefly on the wing during the cooler dry season; during the wet
   season, the larval food plant is seasonally deciduous and it is
   suspected that the butterfly undergoes pupal diapause. The cryptically
   coloured green pupa and tendency to pupate singly in concealed
   situations of D.?aestiva are highly unusual traits among Delias and are
   hypothesized to be adaptive responses associated with pupal diapause
   during the wet season. The unique habitat association, novel food plant
   specialization, and restricted distribution of D.?aestiva emphasizess
   the biogeographical peculiarities of northern Australia, especially
   patterns of historical (vicariant) differentiation between the Top End
   and Cape York Peninsula within the Australian Monsoon Tropics. (C) 2012

   nutritional adversity in the larval period increased sitter but not
   rover adult exploratory behavior. Increasing for gene expression in the
   mushroom bodies, an important center of integration in the fly brain,
   changed the amount of exploratory behavior exhibited by sitter adults
   when they did not experience early nutritional adversity but had no
   effect in sitters that experienced early nutritional adversity.
   Manipulation of the larval nutritional environment also affected adult
   reproductive output of sitters but not rovers, indicating GEIs on
   fitness itself. The natural for variants are an excellent model to
   examine how GEIs underlie the biological embedding of early experience.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological and nutritional state can modify sensory ability and
   perception through hormone signaling. Obesity and related metabolic
   disorders present a chronic imbalance in hormonal signaling that could
   impact sensory systems. In the olfactory system, external chemical cues
   are transduced into electrical signals to encode information. It is
   becoming evident that this system can also detect internal chemical cues
   in the form of molecules of energy homeostasis and endocrine hormones,
   whereby neurons of the olfactory system are modulated to change animal
   behavior towards olfactory cues. We hypothesized that chronic imbalance
   in hormonal signaling and energy homeostasis due to obesity would
   thereby disrupt olfactory behaviors in mice. To test this idea, we
   utilized three mouse models of varying body weight, metabolic hormones,
   and visceral adiposity - 1) C57BL6/J mice maintained on a condensed-milk
   based, moderately high-fat diet (MHF) of 32\% fat for 6 months as the
   diet-induced obesity model, 2) an obesity-resistant, lean line of mice
   due to a gene-targeted deletion of a voltage-dependent potassium channel
   (Kv1.3-null), and 3) a genetic model of obesity as a result of a
   gene-targeted deletion of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R-null).
   Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice failed to find a fatty-scented hidden
   peanut butter cracker, based solely on olfactory cues, any faster than
   an unscented hidden marble, initially suggesting general anosmia.
   However, when these DIO mice were challenged to find a sweet-scented
   hidden chocolate candy, they had no difficulty. Furthermore, DIO mice
   were able to discriminate between fatty acids that differ by a single
   double bond and are components of the MHF diet (linoleic and oleic acid)
   in a habituation-dishabituation paradigm. Obesity-resistant, Kv1.3-null
   mice exhibited no change in scented object retrieval when placed on the
   MHF-diet, nor did they perform differently than wild-type mice in
   parallel habituation-dishabituation paradigms of fatty food-related odor
   components. Genetically obese, MC4R-null mice successfully found hidden
   scented objects, but did so more slowly than lean, wild-type mice, in an
   object-dependent fashion. In habituation-dishabituation trials of
   general odorants, MC4R-null mice failed to discriminate a novel odor,
   but were able to distinguish two fatty acids. Object memory recognition
   tests for short- and long-term memory retention demonstrated that
   maintenance on the MHF diet did not modify the ability to perform these
   tasks independent of whether mice became obese or were resistant to
   weight gain (Kv1.3-null), however, the genetically predisposed obese
   mice (MC4R-null) failed the long-term object memory recognition
   performed at 24 h. These results demonstrate that even though both the
   DIO mice and genetically predisposed obese mice are obese, they vary in
   the degree to which they exhibit behavioral deficits in odor detection,
   odor discrimination, and long-term memory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc: All

Abstract = {{Introduction: The impact of health behaviors on the leading causes of
   death across the USA has been well demonstrated. However, limited focus
   has been placed on the leading health risk behaviors of rural
   Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) patients, a particularly
   underserved group. The current study was undertaken to examine the most
   common risk-taking behaviors of rural FQHC patients and to examine if
   risk-taking behaviors vary between insured and uninsured patients.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 199 patients was recruited at an FQHC
   in the rural US South. Participants completed a battery of demographic
   and health risk behavior assessments.
   Results: The most common risk behaviors were eating fried foods, not
   eating five servings of vegetables per day, not eating three servings of
   fruit per day, drinking caloric beverages, not exercising regularly, not
   wearing a seatbelt, having sex without a condom and smoking. Uninsured
   patients were more likely to talk on their cell phones while driving
   (p<0.001), more likely to text while driving (p=0.007), more likely to
   have unprotected sex (p=0.004), more likely to drink alcohol (p=0.043)
   and more likely to not seek medical care when needed (p=0.005).
   Conclusions: Rural FQHC patients demonstrated high levels of behavioral
   and health risk-taking, including dietary-, exercise- and
   traffic-related risks, in a context where traditional prevention methods
   have failed to penetrate. Differences exist between insured and
   uninsured patients, indicating that the reasons behind behavioral
   risk-taking may be context-specific and need to be explored further to
   help identify intervention targets that are culturally and situationally
   appropriate for diverse rural groups.}},

Abstract = {{Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in affective disorders and the
   action of antidepressants (ADs) although the functional significance of
   this association is still unclear. The use of animal models closely
   mimicking human comorbid affective and anxiety disorders seen in the
   majority of patients should provide relevant novel information. Here, we
   used a unique genetic mouse model displaying higher trait anxiety (HAB)
   and comorbid depression-like behavior. We demonstrate that HABs have a
   lower rate of hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired functional
   integration of newly born neurons as compared with their normal
   anxiety/depression-like behavior (NAB) controls. In HABs, chronic
   treatment with the AD fluoxetine alleviated their higher depression-like
   behavior and protected them from relapse for 3 but not 7 weeks after
   discontinuation of the treatment without affecting neurogenesis. Similar
   to what has been observed in depressed patients, fluoxetine treatment
   induced anxiogenic-like effects during the early treatment phase in NABs
   along with a reduction in neurogenesis. On the other hand, treatment
   with AD drugs with a particularly strong anxiolytic component, namely
   the neurokinin-1-receptorant-agonist L-822 429 or tianeptine, increased
   the reduced rate of neurogenesis in HABs up to NAB levels. In addition,
   challenge-induced hypoactivation of dentate gyrus (DG) neurons in HABs
   was normalized by all three drugs. Overall, these data suggest that
   AD-like effects in a psychopathological mouse model are commonly
   associated with modulation of DG hypoactivity but not neurogenesis,
   suggesting normalization of hippocampal hypoactivity as a
   neurobiological marker indicating successful remission. Finally, rather
   than to higher depression-related behavior, neurogenesis seems to be
   linked to pathological anxiety. Translational Psychiatry (2012) 2, e171;

Abstract = {{Food is important to any animal, and a large part of the behavioral
   repertoire is concerned with ensuring adequate nutrition. Two main
   nutritional sensations, hunger and satiety, produce opposite behaviors.
   Hungry animals seek food, increase exploratory behavior and continue
   feeding once they encounter food. Satiated animals decrease exploratory
   behavior, take rest, and stop feeding. The signals of hunger or satiety
   and their effects on physiology and behavior will depend not only on the
   animal's current nutritional status, but also on its experience and the
   environment in which the animal evolved. In our novel, nutritionally
   rich environment, improper control of appetite contributes to diseases
   from anorexia to the current epidemic of obesity. Despite extraordinary
   recent advances, genetic contribution to appetite control is still
   poorly understood partly due to lack of simple genetic model systems. In
   this review, we will discuss current understanding of molecular and
   cellular mechanisms by which animals regulate food intake depending on
   their nutritional status. Then, focusing on relatively less known
   muscarinic and cGMP signals, we will discuss how the molecular and
   behavioral aspects of hunger and satiety are conserved in a simple
   invertebrate model system, Caenorhabditis elegans so as for us to use it
   to understand the genetics of appetite control.}},

Abstract = {{Predation may drive differential selection among personality types, but
   the mechanism linking personality with predation risk is poorly
   understood. One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones
   (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards
   predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future
   fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress
   physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated
   flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria
   mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone
   concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body
   condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether
   stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either
   independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether
   incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females,
   would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for
   individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and
   females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations
   generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by
   interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High
   stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger
   females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females.
   Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less
   strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy
   females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter
   incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness,
   helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival.
   However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood
   in isolation from effects of individual quality. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Divergent diet menus could cause sympatric divergence of risk

   species of tits (family Paridae): varied tits, Poecile varius, marsh
   tits, Poecile palustris, and great tits, Parus major, which form
   mixed-species foraging flocks in Japan. Binary choice tests, offering
   rewards of differing amount and probability, were conducted in the
   laboratory. Great tits and marsh tits were found to be risk prone (and

   granivorous). Diet menus were examined in the laboratory using
   behavioural titration tests between sunflower seeds and mealworms. The
   results of these tests were similar to patterns of food exploitation
   determined using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15

   the dominant varied tits drove the other two species of tits towards

Abstract = {{The escape of fish from aquaculture is a persistent economic problem for
   farmers as well as an environmental problem that threatens wild fish
   population as a consequence of potential negative ecological and genetic
   interactions. Farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) cause significant
   damage by biting the net and creating holes through which they escape.
   We determined the role of food, cage enrichment, net damage, and
   individual temperament on net biting behavior. During four separate
   trials, net interactions by fish were observed in relation to
   combinations of the above treatments. Fish with no access to food and in
   plain (not enriched) cages interacted the most with the net wall, with
   7.5 and 12.6 more interactions per h, respectively, than fish with food
   that were in enriched cages (food P = 0.01; enrichment P < 0.01). Of the
   stimulating objects used to enrich cages, 97\% of interactions were with
   the tubes that provided refuge (P < 0.01). Cod were attracted to damaged
   areas of net, interacting 0.12 more times per h than at undamaged areas
   (P < 0.01). Individuals showed consistent behavior over time, but there
   was no relationship between temperament and net interactions (P = 0.17).
   The results indicate that appropriate feeding levels and cage enrichment

   potential for fish to escape. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have

   dependent upon early life conditions. In particular, altered maternal
   nutrition, including undernutrition and overnutrition, can lead to
   metabolic disorders in offspring characterised by obesity and leptin
   resistance. The adipokine leptin has received significant interest as a
   potential programming factor; alterations in the profile of leptin in
   early life are associated with altered susceptibility to obesity and
   metabolic disorders in adulthood. Maintenance of a critical leptin level
   during early development facilitates the normal maturation of tissues
   and signalling pathways involved in metabolic homeostasis. A period of
   relative hypoor hyperleptinemia during this window of development will
   induce some of the metabolic adaptations which underlie developmental
   programming. However, it remains unclear whether leptin alone is a
   critical factor for the programming of obesity. At least in animal

   reversible by manipulating the concentration of circulating leptin

   Sexual approach behavior was observed more frequently under windy than

   females was significantly lower on swaying leaves than on fixed leaves.
   Our results thus indicate that male mantids were more active in response

Abstract = {{Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been shown to cause adverse
   effects on a number of biomarkers of health in birds. POPs may impair
   immune function and alter the stress response, defined as a suite of
   behavioral and physiological responses to environmental perturbations.
   Recent studies have also proposed that POPs can induce oxidative stress.
   Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies simultaneously assessing the
   potential damaging effects of POPs on the latter biomarkers. In this
   study, we examined the contribution of legacy (organochlorines; (OCs))
   and emerging (flame retardants; PBDEs) POPs to individual variations in
   stress levels (feather corticosterone), humoral immunity (plasma
   immunoglobulin Y levels) and oxidative stress occurring in three
   breeding colonies of a top predator seabird, the Great skua
   (Stercorarius skua), distributed from temperate regions to the high
   Arctic: Shetland (60 degrees N), Iceland (63 degrees N) and Bjernoya (74
   degrees N). Our results demonstrated that plasma concentrations of OCs
   in Great skuas from Bjornoya are among the highest in North Atlantic
   seabirds, with up to 7900 mu g/kg (ww) Sigma Cs. Yet, a latitudinal
   gradient in POP levels was observed with all compounds being
   significantly higher in Bjornoya than in Iceland and Shetland (on
   average 4-7 fold higher for OCs and 2.5-4.5 for PBDEs, respectively).
   Contrary to our predictions, skuas breeding at the least contaminated
   site (i.e., Shetland) experienced the poorest physiological condition;
   i.e., the highest levels of stress hormones (25\% higher) and oxidative
   stress (50\% higher) and the lowest immunoglobulin levels (15\% lower)
   compared to the two other colonies. Finally, our results failed to point
   out consistent within-colony relationships between biomarkers of health
   and POPs. Overall, it is suggested that other ecological factors such as
   food availability could constrain physiological indicators more than

   Nicotine-exposed animals expressed hyperactivity, increased number of

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2159-2174}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species present a global threat to natural ecosystems and
   native biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that invasive range
   expansion is often related to the invader's life histories and dispersal
   behavior. Among behavioral traits, boldness is a key trait that may aid
   species in performing well in novel environments. Thus, along a species'
   invaded range, individuals from the invasion front should be bolder,
   better dispersers, and have life histories that maximize population
   growth relative to established populations. We tested these hypotheses
   with the invasion of the African jewelfish Hemichromis letourneuxi in
   Everglades National Park (ENP). Jewelfish entered ENP in 2000, and since
   then they have expanded their range rapidly but traceably. Our study
   examined variation in reproductive investment, body condition, gut
   fullness, boldness, and dispersal behavior across six wild-caught
   populations of African jewelfish. Boldness and dispersal were tested
   using an emergence-activity test and an emergence-dispersal test in
   large, outdoor experimental setups. We dissected fish from the six
   populations to assess life histories. Populations from the invasion
   front (western ENP) had higher reproductive investment, higher gut
   fullness, and better body condition, but they were not relatively bolder
   nor better dispersers than inner populations (eastern ENP). As the
   invasion progressed, lower intraspecific density at the invasion front
   may have relaxed competition and allowed for higher fitness and
   reproductive investment. Understanding underlying behavioral and
   life-history mechanisms of an invasion is key for the development of
   management strategies that aim to contain current invaders and prevent
   the spread of future ones.}},

Title = {{Behavioral and physiological female responses to male sex ratio bias in
   a pond-breeding amphibian}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The phenomenon of sexual conflict has been well
   documented, and in populations with biased operational sex ratios the
   consequences for the rarer sex can be severe. Females are typically a
   limited resource and males often evolve aggressive mating behaviors,
   which can improve individual fitness for the male while negatively
   impacting female condition and fitness. In response, females can adjust
   their behavior to minimize exposure to aggressive mating tactics or
   minimize the costs of mating harassment. While male-male competition is
   common in amphibian mating systems, little is known about the
   consequences or responses of females. The red-spotted newt
   (Notophthalmus viridescens) is a common pond-breeding amphibian with a
   complex, well-studied mating system where males aggressively court
   females. Breeding populations across much of its range have male-biased
   sex ratios and we predicted that female newts would have behavioral
   mechanisms to mitigate mating pressure from males. We conducted four
   experiments examining the costs and behavioral responses of female N.
   viridescens exposed to a male-biased environment.
   Results: In field enclosures, we found that female newts exposed to a
   male-biased environment during the five-month breeding season ended with
   lower body condition compared to those in a female-biased environment.
   Shorter-term exposure to a male-biased environment for five weeks caused
   a decrease in circulating total leukocyte and lymphocyte abundance in
   blood, which suggests females experienced physiological stress. In
   behavioral experiments, we found that females were more agitated in the
   presence of male chemical cues and females in a male-biased environment
   spent more time in refuge than those in a female-biased environment.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that male-biased conditions can incur
   costs to females of decreased condition and potentially increased risk
   of infection. However, we found that females can also alter their
   behavior and microhabitat use under a male-biased sex ratio. Consistent
   with surveys showing reduced detection probabilities for females, our
   research suggests that females avoid male encounters using edge and
   substrate habitat. Our work illustrates the integrated suite of impacts
   that sexual conflict can have on the structure and ecology of a
   population.}},

Title = {{Modelling Sensory Limitation: The Role of Tree Selection, Memory and
   Information Transfer in Bats' Roost Searching Strategies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Sensory limitation plays an important role in the evolution of animal
   behaviour. Animals have to find objects of interest (e.g. food,
   shelters, predators). When sensory abilities are strongly limited,
   animals adjust their behaviour to maximize chances for success. Bats are
   nocturnal, live in complex environments, are capable of flight and must
   confront numerous perceptual challenges (e.g. limited sensory range,
   interfering clutter echoes). This makes them an excellent model for
   studying the role of compensating behaviours to decrease costs of
   finding resources. Cavity roosting bats are especially interesting
   because the availability of tree cavities is often limited, and their
   quality is vital for bats during the breeding season. From a bat's
   sensory point of view, cavities are difficult to detect and finding them
   requires time and energy. However, tree cavities are also long lasting,
   allowing information transfer among conspecifics. Here, we use a simple
   simulation model to explore the benefits of tree selection, memory and
   eavesdropping (compensation behaviours) to searches for tree cavities by
   bats with short and long perception range. Our model suggests that
   memory and correct discrimination of tree suitability are the basic
   strategies decreasing the cost of roost finding, whereas perceptual
   range plays a minor role in this process. Additionally, eavesdropping
   constitutes a buffer that reduces the costs of finding new resources
   (such as roosts), especially when they occur in low density. We conclude
   that natural selection may promote different strategies of roost finding
   in relation to habitat conditions and cognitive skills of animals.}},

Title = {{Widespread and persistent invasions of terrestrial habitats coincident
   with larval feeding behavior transitions during snail-killing fly
   evolution (Diptera: Sciomyzidae)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Transitions in habitats and feeding behaviors were
   fundamental to the diversification of life on Earth. There is ongoing
   debate regarding the typical directionality of transitions between
   aquatic and terrestrial habitats and the mechanisms responsible for the
   preponderance of terrestrial to aquatic transitions. Snail-killing flies
   (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) represent an excellent model system to study such
   transitions because their larvae display a range of feeding behaviors,
   being predators, parasitoids or saprophages of a variety of mollusks in
   freshwater, shoreline and dry terrestrial habitats. The remarkable genus
   Tetanocera (Tetanocerini) occupies five larval feeding groups and all of
   the habitat types mentioned above. This study has four principal
   objectives: (i) construct a robust estimate of phylogeny for Tetanocera
   and Tetanocerini, (ii) estimate the evolutionary transitions in larval
   feeding behaviors and habitats, (iii) test the monophyly of feeding
   groups and (iv) identify mechanisms underlying sciomyzid habitat and
   feeding behavior evolution.
   Results: Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of molecular
   data provided strong support that the Sciomyzini, Tetanocerini and
   Tetanocera are monophyletic. However, the monophyly of many behavioral
   groupings was rejected via phylogenetic constraint analyses. We
   determined that (i) the ancestral sciomyzid lineage was terrestrial,
   (ii) there was a single terrestrial to aquatic habitat transition early
   in the evolution of the Tetanocerini and (iii) there were at least 10
   independent aquatic to terrestrial habitat transitions and at least 15
   feeding behavior transitions during tetanocerine phylogenesis. The
   ancestor of Tetanocera was aquatic with five lineages making independent
   transitions to terrestrial habitats and seven making independent
   transitions in feeding behaviors.
   Conclusions: The preponderance of aquatic to terrestrial transitions in
   sciomyzids goes against the trend generally observed across eukaryotes.
   Damp shoreline habitats are likely transitional where larvae can change
   habitat but still have similar prey available. Transitioning from
   aquatic to terrestrial habitats is likely easier than the reverse for
   sciomyzids because morphological characters associated with
   air-breathing while under the water's surface are lost rather than
   gained, and sciomyzids originated and diversified during a general
   drying period in Earth's history. Our results imply that any animal
   lineage having aquatic and terrestrial members, respiring the same way
   in both habitats and having the same type of food available in both
   habitats could show a similar pattern of multiple independent habitat
   transitions coincident with changes in behavioral and morphological
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse fetal environment due to maternal undernutrition or exposure to
   environmental chemicals alters glucocorticoid (GC) metabolism increasing
   the risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of maternal exposure to cadmium (Cd, 50 ppm)
   during pregnancy in the methylation of fetal hepatic glucocorticoid
   receptor promoter (GR) and the correlation with its expression and that
   of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1a and 3a). We also studied the
   expression of liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and
   acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), two enzymes involved in the metabolism of
   carbohydrates and lipids respectively. The methylation of the rat GR
   gene exon 1(10) (GR1(10)) in nucleotides -2536 to -2361 was analyzed by
   pyrosequencing. Quantitative real time PCR was used to assess hepatic
   GR, PEPCK and AOX mRNA, and their protein levels using Western blotting
   analysis. Differential methylation was noted across groups at all CpG
   sites in the GR exon 110 in a sex-dependent manner. In males, CpG were
   more methylated than the controls (185 +/- 21\%, p<0.001) but only CpG
   sites 1,6,7 and 9 showed a significantly different extent of
   methylation. In addition, a lower expression of GR (mRNA and protein)
   was found. On the contrary, in females, CpG were less methylated than
   the controls (62 +/- 11\%, p<0.05) and overexpressed, affecting PEPCK
   and AOX expression, which did not change in males. The GR methylation
   profile correlates with DNMT3a expression which may explain epigenetic
   sex-dependent changes on GR1(10) promoter induced by Cd treatment. In
   conclusion, Cd exposure during pregnancy affects fetal liver DNMT3a
   resulting in sex-dependent changes in methylation and expression of
   GR1(10). Although these effects do not seem to be directly involved in
   the low birth weight and height, they may have relevant implications for
   long-term health.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Psychological stress, which deteriorates mental and physical
   health of individuals at their working environment, is an important
   problem for public health and health at work. Recent studies have
   indicated that living with animals might be beneficial for individuals
   with physical, mental and social health problems, and it could even
   increase the quality of life in these people. In this present study, we
   aimed to investigate the relationship between pet ownership,
   psychological stress level, regular exercising, and smoking among white
   collar workers.
   Material and Method: In this cross-sectional study, 212 out of 230 white
   collar workers (92\%), who worked for a business company in Besiktas
   district of Istanbul, were enrolled. 12-Item General Health
   Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were applied to define psychological stress
   levels and mental health conditions of the workers. Data obtained from
   GHQ-12 was evaluated by using Goldberg type grading method (0-0-1-1).
   Sociodemographic characteristics of participants, and information about
   the relationship between pet ownership, and smoking, regular exercising
   were obtained by a questionnaire form made up of close- and open-ended
   questions. Data were evaluated by percentage distribution, Chi square
   test and Mann Whitney U test.
   Results: Of the participants, 51 were female, 161 were male, and the
   mean of age was 30.65 +/- 3.56 years. Among the participants, 82 had
   pets and 130 individuals had no pet. Rate of pet owners was 98.7\% in
   our study group with total score of GHQ-12 <= 1, whereas all
   participants with the score of 2-3 (moderate) had pets. Moreover, 129
   participants, the entire group except one individual, with the total
   score of GHQ-12 >= 4 expressed that they had no pets. GHQ-12 scores
   among pet owners were statistically significantly lower than the ones
   without pets (p<0.001). Smoking rate was statistically significantly
   higher among participants without pets than the rate in pet owners
   (p<0.001). Pet owner participants were exercising significantly more
   regularly than the ones without pets (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: As far as the reported changes in behavior and attitudes of
   participants, pet ownership had favorable effects in healthy life
   behaviors like nutrition, regular exercising, and non-smoking. According
   to the results of General Health Questionnaire among workers,
   psychological stress level was higher among participants without pets.
   We believe that having a pet can be supportive for improving physical
   and mental health conditions of individuals, who are working under
   stressful conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection eliminates phenotypic variation from populations,
   generation after generationan observation that haunted Darwin. So, how
   does new phenotypic variation arise, and is it always random with
   respect to fitness? Repeated behavioral responses to a novel
   environmentparticularly those that are learnedare typically
   advantageous. If those behaviors yield more extreme or novel
   morphological variants via developmental plasticity, then previously
   cryptic genetic variation may be exposed to natural selection.
   Significantly, because the mean phenotypic effect of use and disuse is
   also typically favorable, previously cryptic genetic variation can be
   transformed into phenotypic variation that is both visible to selection
   and biased in an adaptive direction. Therefore, use-induced
   developmental plasticity in a very real sense creates new phenotypic
   variation that is nonrandom with respect to fitness, in contrast to the
   random phenotypic effects of mutation, recombination, and direct effects
   of environment (stress, nutrition). I offer here (a) a brief review of
   the immense literature on the effects of use and disuse on morphology,
   (b) a simple yet general model illustrating how cryptic genetic
   variation may be exposed to selection by developmentally plastic
   responses that alter trait performance in response to use and disuse,
   and (c) a more detailed model of a positive feedback loop between
   learning (handed behavior) and morphological plasticity (use-induced
   morphological asymmetry) that may rapidly generate novel phenotypic
   variation and facilitate the evolution of conspicuous morphological
   asymmetries. Evidence from several sources suggests that handed
   behaviors played an important role both in the origin of novel forms

Abstract = {{Background: An impaired ability to compensate for calories and increased
   eating in the absence of hunger (EAR) has been associated with increased
   energy intake and weight gain in unrelated children.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to compare caloric compensation
   {[}the percentage compensation index (\%COMPX)] and EAH in
   weight-discordant siblings aged 5-12 y.
   Design: In a crossover, behavioral genetics design, 47 same-sex sibling
   pairs (53\% female, 55\% full siblings) were served dinner once a week
   for 3 wk. Across conditions, siblings were served the same dinner, but
   25 min before dinner, they either consumed in full or did not consume 1
   of 2 preloads that varied in energy density (ED; 0.57 or 0.97 kcal/g).
   On the day when no preload was consumed, EAH was assessed after dinner
   and defined as the number of calories consumed from snacks.
   Results: Overweight/obese siblings undercompensated {[}\%COMPX: -48.8
   +/- 56.3 (mean +/- SEM)] and therefore overate after the high-ED
   preload, whereas normal-weight siblings showed accurate compensation
   (\%COMPX: 101.3 +/- 51.9; P = 0.03). Furthermore, overweight/obese
   siblings consumed 34\% more calories (93 kcal) in the absence of hunger

   identifying the different factors influencing each stage that is it
   possible to understand the evolutionary processes driving the arms race
   between predators and prey. Using a long-term data set from Serengeti
   National Park in Tanzania, we investigated the importance of
   demographic, environmental, and prey-based factors in influencing the
   success of hunt stages of a stalking predator, the cheetah, Acinonyx
   jubatus. The chase and overall hunting success were influenced by the
   age of the cheetah and prey size, while the effect of habitat features
   could only be seen in the stalk. Whether a stalk turned into a chase was
   dependent on prey size, and in the dry season on proximity to rivers.
   Contrary to expectation, the hunger level of the cheetah, the presence
   of cubs, and the type of habitat where the hunt took place had no effect
   on hunting success. Different factors thus affect the success of
   individual hunt stages, and the predation risk of prey is influenced not
   only by its size, the habitat it is in, and the age of the its predator,
   but also by hunt stage. This reveals an increased complexity of
   predation risk that has implications for predator and prey dynamics,
   especially in systems with multiple predator and prey species. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Precopulatory sexual cannibalism may represent the most extreme form of
   sexual conflict because it necessarily truncates the reproductive
   potential of the victim. Three of the most prominent mechanisms invoked
   to explain incidence of precopulatory sexual cannibalism are the
   `adaptive foraging', `aggressive spillover' and `mate choice'
   hypotheses. These hypotheses argue that sexual cannibalism is either (1)
   the result of female choice, where females gauge the benefits of suitors
   as perspective mates versus prey, (2) a neutral (or deleterious)
   by-product of selection on aggressiveness in nonreproductive contexts,
   or (3) a mechanism by which females express their mating preferences,
   respectively. We tested the predictions of these hypotheses in the
   funnel-web spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica using staged laboratory
   encounters. We then tracked numerous fitness proxies of cannibalistic
   versus noncannibalistic females to determine whether cannibalism was
   associated with increased female performance. We found that more
   aggressive females and those deprived of food were more likely to engage
   in precopulatory cannibalism. Cannibalism was not associated with male
   condition, male body size or female body size, nor with the mass of
   females' egg cases, the number of eggs therein, or the mass of
   individual eggs. In contrast, there was a positive association between
   the mass of the egg case and the number of offspring that emerged in
   cannibalistic females, but not in noncannibalistic females. Thus,
   offspring of cannibalistic mothers appear to have increased hatching
   success in heavier egg cases. This may represent a novel advantage
   associated with sexual cannibalism. (C) 2012 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Animals adopt varied foraging tactics in order to survive.
   Kleptoparasitism, where animals attempt to steal food already discovered
   by others, is very common among animal species. In this situation,
   depending on the ecological conditions, challenged animals might defend,
   share, or even retreat and leave their food to the challenger. A key
   determinant of the likely behavior is the nature of the food itself. If
   food is discovered in divisible clumps, it can be divided between
   animals in a number of ways. This is the general assumption in one type
   of game-theoretical model of food stealing, producer-scrounger models.
   Alternatively, food items may be essentially indivisible, so that
   sharing is impossible and either the attacker or the defender must
   retain control of all of the food. This is the assumption of the
   alternative game-theoretical models of kleptoparasitism. In this paper,
   using a game-theoretic approach, we relax this assumption of
   indivisibility and introduce the possibility of limited food sharing
   behavior between animals in kleptoparasitic populations. Considering the
   conditions under which food sharing is likely to be common, it is shown
   that food sharing should occur in a wide range of ecological conditions.
   In particular, if food availability is limited, the sharing process does
   not greatly reduce the short-term consumption rate of food and food
   defense has a high cost and/or a low probability of success, then the
   use of the food sharing strategy is beneficial. Thus, the assumption of
   the indivisibility of food items is an important component of previous
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme developmental plasticity within the eusocial insects defines the
   separation between the queen and worker castes. The switch between these
   2 developmental pathways is thought to be under tight social control.
   Although a large emphasis has been placed on the effect of larval
   nutrition on caste determination, workers of many species have no direct
   control over larval feeding. This may be particularly relevant to the
   early evolution of ants, when behaviors that allow fine control over
   larval nutrition, such as mouth-to-mouth food exchange between larvae
   and workers, were probably not yet present. We investigated
   larval-directed aggression as an alternative means to regulate queen
   development in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, a species that retains
   ancestral characteristics. We tested worker response toward natural
   queen-destined larvae and larvae induced to develop as queens using a
   juvenile hormone analog (JHA). Workers from colonies that were not
   rearing queens bit queen-destined larvae, whereas worker-destined larvae
   were not attacked. When colonies were naturally rearing queens, workers
   did not bite JHA-treated larvae, and a larger proportion of these larvae
   developed into queens compared with larvae that received biting. This
   supports the hypothesis that workers of H. saltator use biting to
   inhibit queen development during periods when the conditions for queen
   rearing are not met. We propose that mechanical stress, in addition to
   nutrition, could serve as a mechanism to regulate queen development in
   species that lack fine control over larval food consumption, and this
   may have played a role during the early evolution of eusociality in
   ants.}},

Abstract = {{1. To better predict effects of climate change and predation risk on
   prey animals and ecosystems, we need studies documenting not only
   latitudinal patterns in growth rate but also growth plasticity to
   temperature and predation risk and the underlying proximate mechanisms:
   behaviour (food intake) and digestive physiology (growth efficiency).
   The mechanistic underpinnings of predator-induced growth increases
   remain especially poorly understood. 2. We reared larvae from replicated
   northern and southern populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a
   common garden experiment manipulating temperature and predation risk and
   quantified growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency. 3. The
   predator-induced and temperature-induced growth accelerations were the
   same at both latitudes, despite considerably faster growth rates in the
   southern populations. While the higher growth rates in the southern
   populations and the high rearing temperature were driven by both an
   increased food intake and a higher growth efficiency, the higher growth
   rates under predation risk were completely driven by a higher growth
   efficiency, despite a lowered food intake. 4. The emerging pattern that
   higher growth rates associated with latitude, temperature and predation
   risk were all (partly or completely) mediated by a higher growth
   efficiency has two major implications. First, it indicates that energy
   allocation trade-offs and the associated physiological costs play a
   major role both in shaping large-scale geographic variation in growth
   rates and in shaping the extent and direction of growth rate plasticity.
   Secondly, it suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic
   food chains, where damselfly larvae are important intermediate
   predators, will be higher in southern populations, at higher
   temperatures and under predation risk. This may eventually contribute to
   the lengthening of food chains under these conditions and highlights
   that the prey identity may determine the influence of predation risk on
   food chain length.}},

Abstract = {{Predation threat-associated behavioral response was studied in Rana

   fed on prey tadpoles or insects (Notonecta spp.) and water conditioned

Abstract = {{Background Parenting behaviours are influenced by a range of factors,

   parental fatigue on parenting practices is not known. The first aim of
   this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and

   psychosocial factors significantly associated with fatigue. Methods A
   sample of 1276 Australian parents, of at least one child aged 05 years,
   completed a survey. Demographic, psychosocial (social support, coping
   responses) and parental sleep and self-care information was collected.
   Hierarchical regression was performed to assess the contribution of
   fatigue (modified Fatigue Assessment Scale) to parental practices
   (warmth, irritability and involvement), and parenting experiences
   (Parenting Stress Index, Parenting Sense of Competence Scale).
   Hierarchical multiple regression assessed the contribution of a range of
   parental sleep, psychosocial (social support, coping responses) and
   self-care variables to fatigue when demographic characteristics were
   held constant. Results Higher fatigue was significantly associated with
   lower parental competence (beta=-0.17, P < 0.005), greater parenting
   stress (beta= 0.21, P < 0.005) and more irritability in parentchild
   interactions (beta= 0.11, P < 0.005). Several psychosocial
   characteristics were associated with higher parental fatigue, including
   inadequate social support, poorer diet, poorer sleep quality and
   ineffective coping styles including self-blame and behaviour
   disengagement. Conclusions Fatigue is common, and results suggest that
   fatigue contributes to adverse parental practices and experiences.
   However, possible risk factors for higher fatigue were identified in
   this study, indicating opportunities for intervention, management and

Abstract = {{Studies on leadership have focused either on physiological state as the
   key predictor (i.e. ``leading according to need{''}), or else on
   temperamental asymmetries among group members (i.e. intrinsic
   leadership). In this paper, we explore how both factors interact in
   determining the emergence of leaders. We observed pairs of sticklebacks
   with varying degrees of temperamental difference, and recorded their
   movements back and forth between a safe covered area and a risky
   foraging area, both before and after satiating one of the two pair
   members (but not the other). Before satiation, when the fish had similar
   hunger levels, temperament was a good predictor of social roles, with
   the bolder member of a pair leading and the shyer member following. The
   effect of satiation depended on which fish received the additional food.
   When the shyer member of a pair was fed, and consequently became less
   active, the bolder fish did not change its behaviour but continued to
   lead. By contrast, when the bolder member of a pair was fed, and
   consequently initiated fewer trips out of cover, the shyer partner
   compensated by initiating trips more frequently itself. In pairs that
   differed only a little in temperament, feeding the bolder fish actually
   led to a role reversal, with the shyer fish emerging as a leader in the
   majority of joint trips out of cover. Our results show that leadership
   emerges as the consequence of multiple factors, and that their
   interaction can be complex.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection is a major force driving evolution and is intertwined
   with ecological factors. Differential allocation of limited resources
   has a central role in the cost of reproduction. In this paper, I review
   the costs and benefits of mating in tettigoniids, focussing on nuptial
   gifts, their trade-off with male calling songs, protandry and how mate
   density influences mate choice. Tettigoniids have been widely used as
   model systems for studies of mating costs and benefits; they can provide
   useful general insights. The production and exchange of large nuptial
   gifts by males for mating is an important reproductive strategy in
   tettigoniids. As predicted by sexual selection theory spermatophylax
   size is condition dependent and is constrained by the need to invest in
   calling to attract mates also. Under some circumstances, females benefit
   directly from the nuptial gifts by an increase in reproductive output.
   However, compounds in the nuptial gift can also benefit the male by
   prolonging the period before the female remates. There is also a
   trade-off between adult male maturation and mating success. Where males
   mature before females (protandry) the level of protandry varies in the
   direction predicted by sperm competition theory; namely, early male
   maturation is correlated with a high level of first inseminations being
   reproductively successful. Lastly, mate density in bushcrickets is an
   important environmental factor influencing the behavioural decisions of
   individuals. Where mates are abundant, individuals are more choosey of
   mates; when they are scarce, individuals are less choosey. This review
   reinforces the view that tettigoniids provide excellent models to test
   and understand the economics of matings in both sexes.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies-the addition of
   energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries-can affect
   consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy
   levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and
   resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little
   information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly
   associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important
   role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these
   knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position,
   size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus
   spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot
   dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ
   strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from
   seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the
   habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no
   impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have
   any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However,
   it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of
   both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had
   higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher
   trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level
   forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes
   in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses.
   These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive
   important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical
   response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers
   also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs,
   with longer overall food chain length.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing body of evidence from across animal taxa that
   exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids during development can
   have profound long-term effects upon physiological and behavioral
   phenotypes. Several avian studies have revealed that the degree to which
   an individual's hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responds to
   stressful stimuli as an adult may in effect have been `programmed' or
   set as a result of that individual's corticosterone exposure in ovo or
   as a nestling. Developmental exposure to corticosterone may also have
   effects upon avian `personalities' or coping styles, and evidence from
   mammalian studies suggests that these long-term effects are mediated
   epigenetically via altered expression of relevant DNA sequences.
   Although there does not appear to be a consistent across-species
   pattern, developmental exposure to elevated corticosterone levels may
   shape adult coping style with such exposure, resulting in adults that
   are more timid and with increased HPA axis responsiveness to stress than
   those individuals that were exposed to relatively little corticosterone
   as nestlings. Recent work in Florida Scrub-jays (Aphelocoma
   coerulescens) has found that baseline corticosterone levels in nestlings
   at 11 days post-hatch explained 84\% of the variation in `personality'
   (bold vs. timid) when those individuals were tested at approximately 7
   months of age. The overall `personality' scores at 7-8 months of age
   were based upon tests that evaluated and combined the Jays' responses to
   three tests: two startle and one neophobia stimuli. Here, we present
   findings on some of the factors that contribute to corticosterone levels
   of nestling Florida Scrub-jays, both within and among broods. Our prior
   and continuing research, as this overview will present, suggests that
   maternal attentiveness at the nest and paternal provisioning are
   important factors that mediate nestling corticosterone levels.}},

   between intensities of the 2 parasites. Minnows infected with black spot
   had on average twice as many O. ptychocheilus metacercariae as
   similar-sized minnows without any black spot cercariae. We found no
   correlation between body condition of minnows and intensity for either
   parasite. We measured 2 aspects of anti-predator competence to test for
   effects linked to parasite intensity. We found no correlation between
   intensity of either species of parasite and latency to behavioral
   response to attack from a mechanical model heron, nor was there any
   effect of parasite intensity on a measure of shoaling affinity. The
   absence of any detectable effect of metacercariae on anti-predator
   competence in minnows may reflect selection against parasite pathology
   from predation by non-hosts of the parasites and overwinter mortality
   due to low dissolved oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Poor prenatal nutrition has been associated with
   schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the Netherlands and China, and it
   has been suggested that perinatal and postnatal nutritional factors lead
   to the development of schizophrenia and the exhibition of schizotypal
   traits later in life. There appears to be no prior research on the
   existence of possible factors that may mediate the relationship between
   malnutrition and schizophrenia spectrum disorders or whether this
   association is a direct one. The authors tested the hypothesis that low
   IQ mediates the relationship between early childhood malnutrition and
   adult schizotypal personality.
   Method: Participants were drawn from a birth cohort of 1,795 boys and
   girls who were followed prospectively. Objective indicators of
   malnutrition (anemia and stunting) were assessed at age 3. Verbal and
   performance intelligence were assessed at age 11, and schizotypal
   personality was assessed at age 23.
   Results: Both stunting and anemia at age 3 were associated with low IQ
   at age 11. Low performance IQ at age 11 was associated with increased
   interpersonal and disorganized features of schizotypal personality at
   age 23. Poor performance IQ was found to mediate the relationship
   between poor nutrition at age 3 and interpersonal and disorganized
   features of schizotypy at age 23. Findings in female participants were
   replicated in male participants.
   Conclusions: Given that poor nutrition is an alterable risk factor,
   these findings suggest that nutritional enhancements may improve brain
   functioning and possibly reduce some features of schizotypal personality
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Three core symptoms of autistic spectrum disorders are stereotypic
   movements, resistance to change in routines and deficits in social
   interaction. In order to understand their neuronal mechanisms, there is
   a dire need for behavioral paradigms to assess those symptoms in
   rodents. Here we present a novel method which is based on positive
   reward in a customized wheel-running apparatus to assess these symptoms.
   As a proof of concept, 4 mouse strains were tested in the new behavioral
   paradigm; 2 control lines (C57BL/6 and ICR) and 2 mouse-models of autism
   (BTBR T+ tf/J and Nlgn3(tm1sud)) We found that the C57BL/6. ICR and
   Nlgn3(tm1sud) mice showed a significant reduction in stereotypical
   behavior in the presence of the running wheel, ability to forfeit the
   running habit when the running-wheel was jammed, and preference of
   interacting with a social stimulus over the jammed running-wheel. No
   difference was found between genotypes of the Nlgn3(tm1sud) mice. On the
   other hand, the BTBR mice exhibited persistent, elevated levels of
   stereotypical behavior. In addition, they presented a deficit in their
   ability to adjust to a changing environment, as manifested in
   persistence to interact with the wheel even when it was jammed. Lastly,
   the BTBR mice exhibited no significant preference to interact with the
   stranger mouse over the jammed running-wheel. These results were
   validated by a set of commonly used behavioral tests. Overall, our novel
   behavioral paradigm detects multiple components of autistic-like
   phenotypes, including cognitive rigidity, stereotypic behavior and

Abstract = {{Body condition is an important determinant of fitness in many natural
   populations. However, as for many fitness traits, the underlying genes
   that regulate body condition remain elusive. The dopamine receptor D4
   gene (DRD4) is a promising candidate as dopamine is known to play an
   important role in the regulation of food intake and the metabolism of
   both glucose and lipids in vertebrates. In this study, we take advantage
   of a large data set of greater flamingos, Phoenicopterus roseus, to test
   whether DRD4 polymorphism predicts early body condition (EBC) while
   controlling for whole-genome effects of inbreeding and outbreeding using
   microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity (MLH). We typed 670 of these
   individuals for exon 3 of the homologue of the human DRD4 gene and 10
   microsatellite markers. When controlling for the effects of yearly
   environmental variations and differences between sexes, we found strong
   evidence of an association between exon 3 DRD4 polymorphisms and EBC,
   with 2.22.3\% of the variation being explained by DRD4 polymorphism,
   whereas there was only weak evidence that MLH predicts EBC. Because EBC
   is most likely a polygenic trait, this is a considerable amount of
   variation explained by a single gene. This is to our knowledge, the
   first study to show an association between exon 3 DRD4 polymorphism and
   body condition in non-human animals. We anticipate that the DRD4 gene as
   well as other genes coding for neurotransmitters and their receptors may
   play an important role in explaining variation in traits that affect
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{An ever-expanding scientific literature highlights the impact of the

   species, experimental studies have clearly shown that prenatal
   experiences can have a substantial impact on outcomes relevant to later
   health, welfare and productivity. In particular, stress or sub-optimal
   nutrition experienced by the mother during pregnancy has been shown to
   have wide-ranging and important effects on how her offspring cope with
   their social, physical and infectious environment. Variation in the
   conditions for development provided by the reproductive tract or egg,
   for instance by altered nutritional supply or hormonal exposure, may
   therefore explain a large degree of variation in many welfare- and

   number of management practices for pre-birth/hatch individuals that
   could compromise their later welfare. Such studies may have relevance
   for the welfare of animals under human care, depending on the extent to

Abstract = {{Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections and autoimmunity are associated
   with the onset of a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders in children,
   with the prototypical disorder being Sydenham chorea (SC). Our aim was
   to develop an animal model that resembled the behavioral,
   pharmacological, and immunological abnormalities of SC and other
   streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Male Lewis rats
   exposed to GAS antigen exhibited motor symptoms (impaired food
   manipulation and beam walking) and compulsive behavior (increased
   induced-grooming). These symptoms were alleviated by the D2 blocker
   haloperidol and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine,
   respectively, drugs that are used to treat motor symptoms and
   compulsions in streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Streptococcal exposure resulted in antibody deposition in the striatum,
   thalamus, and frontal cortex, and concomitant alterations in dopamine
   and glutamate levels in cortex and basal ganglia, consistent with the
   known pathophysiology of SC and related neuropsychiatric disorders.
   Autoantibodies (IgG) of GAS rats reacted with tubulin and caused
   elevated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling in
   SK-N-SH neuronal cells, as previously found with sera from SC and
   related neuropsychiatric disorders. Our new animal model translates
   directly to human disease and led us to discover autoantibodies targeted

Abstract = {{Understanding how animals partition effort between vigilance for
   predators and other conflicting activities has been a mainstay of animal
   behaviour research. Classical theories implicitly assume that animals
   alternate between high and low vigilance states over short timescales,
   but that average effort invested in vigilance is constant over an
   extended bout of such alternations. However, one recent model suggests
   that vigilance should be adjusted dynamically to short-term changes in
   the perception of predation risk and would tend to decrease with time.
   Indeed, as time passes by without disturbances, perception of the need
   for vigilance should decrease and prey animals may allocate more time to
   competing activities. Here, we examined how the proportion of sleeping
   gulls (Larus spp.) in loafing groups changed over time. Sleeping gulls
   can only maintain low levels of vigilance against external threats
   (compared to alert individuals), and we predicted that the proportion of
   sleeping gulls at loafing sites should increase over time when no
   disturbances occur. Statistically significant changes in the proportion
   of sleeping gulls as a function of time occurred in the majority of
   sequences and an increase was observed significantly more often than
   predicted by chance alone. This temporal pattern cannot be caused by
   reduction in hunger levels because gulls are not feeding at loafing
   sites. The results indicate that vigilance can be adjusted dynamically
   in response to short-term temporal changes in the perception of
   predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Most organisms face the problem of foraging and maintaining growth while
   avoiding predators. Typical animal responses to predator exposure
   include reduced feeding, elevated metabolism, and altered development
   rate, all of which can be beneficial in the presence of predators but
   detrimental in their absence. How then do animals balance growth and
   predator avoidance? In a series of field and greenhouse experiments, we
   document that the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta, reduced
   feeding by 30-40\% owing to the risk of predation by stink bugs, but
   developed more rapidly and gained the same mass as unthreatened
   caterpillars. Assimilation efficiency, extraction of nitrogen from food,
   and percent body lipid content all increased during the initial phase
   (1-3 d) of predation risk, indicating that enhanced nutritional
   physiology allows caterpillars to compensate when threatened. However,
   we report physiological costs of predation risk, including altered body
   composition (decreased glycogen) and reductions in assimilation
   efficiency later in development. Our findings indicate that hornworm
   caterpillars use temporally dynamic compensatory mechanisms that
   ameliorate the trade-off between predator avoidance and growth in the
   short term, deferring costs to a period when they are less vulnerable to

Title = {{Maternal effects on male weaponry: female dung beetles produce major
   sons with longer horns when they perceive higher population density}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal effects are environmental influences on the
   phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in
   its mother, and are expected to evolve whenever females are better
   capable of assessing the environmental conditions that their offspring
   will experience than the offspring themselves. In the dung beetle
   Onthophagus taurus, conditional male dimorphism is associated with
   alternative reproductive tactics: majors fight and guard females whereas
   minors sneak copulations. Furthermore, variation in dung beetle
   population density has different fitness consequences for each male
   morph, and theory predicts that higher population density might select
   for a higher frequency of minors and/or greater expenditure on weaponry
   in majors. Because adult dung beetles provide offspring with all the
   nutritional resources for their development, maternal effects strongly
   influence male phenotype.
   Results: Here we tested whether female O. taurus are capable of
   perceiving population density, and responding by changing the phenotype
   of their offspring. We found that mothers who were reared with other
   conspecifics in their pre-mating period produced major offspring that
   had longer horns across a wider range of body sizes than the major
   offspring of females that were reared in isolation in their pre-mating
   period. Moreover, our results indicate that this maternal effect on male
   weaponry does not operate through the amount of dung provided by females
   to their offspring, but is rather transmitted through egg or brood mass
   composition. Finally, although theory predicts that females experiencing
   higher density might produce more minor males, we found no support for
   this, rather the best fitting models were equivocal as to whether fewer
   or the same proportions of minors were produced.
   Conclusions: Our study describes a new type of maternal effect in dung
   beetles, which probably allows females to respond to population density
   adaptively, preparing at least their major offspring for the sexual
   competition they will face in the future. This new type of maternal
   effect in dung beetles represents a novel transgenerational response of
   alternative reproductive tactics to population density.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling
   phenomenon. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain
   intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour,
   which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations.
   Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main
   life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual
   differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals
   of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using
   open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity,
   exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found
   systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different
   residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high
   expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high
   current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age.
   Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body
   condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal
   variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction might maintain personality
   variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this

Abstract = {{We explored the consequences of male and female explorative and
   risk-taking behaviors that are components of a behavioral syndrome, as
   well as basic demographic and physical characteristics of three measures
   of reproductive performance in Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri).
   Older individuals of both sexes performed slightly better in measures of
   annual reproductive performance. Age was also positively correlated
   within pairs. In some years, males in better winter body condition
   performed better, whereas higher-performing females were in worse
   condition. Because winter body condition was negatively correlated
   within pairs, males in better condition possibly enabled their mates to
   invest more in reproduction in a given year, losing more body mass than
   low-performing females. Overall, variation in individual male and female
   traits, especially behavioral traits, explained little of the variation
   in annual reproductive performance. That age was identified as the
   single most consistent factor, which was correlated within pairs,
   suggests that experience and compatibility may be more important than
   inherent individual traits. By contrast, when examining reproductive
   performance over multiple years, less explorative and risk-averse males
   produced more offspring over the 3-year study period; the direction of
   relationships of the four behavioral traits in the syndrome was highly
   consistent. This suggests an advantage for linkage of these traits in a
   syndrome, supporting the hypothesis that the combination of traits in

Abstract = {{An individual's ability to identify and respond accurately to a predator
   greatly affects its probability of survival. Chemosensory cues are an
   important mechanism for predator detection in aquatic environments.
   Whether fish are aware of the risks posed by distinct fish species, or
   whether a common chemosensory cue distinguishes predatory fishes, is
   unknown. One possibility is that fish distinguish predatory fishes based
   on their diet. To test this, we manipulated the diet of three nominally
   non-piscivorous species and examined behavioural responses of juvenile
   anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, to chemical cues of nonpredators fed a
   diet rich in fish product. In pairwise choice trials, naive A. percula
   showed indifference to chemosensory cues from nonpiscivorous fishes fed
   their usual diet, but significantly avoided chemical cues from
   piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes fed a diet containing fish
   product. These results indicate that A. percula larvae innately
   distinguish between piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes based on
   chemosensory cues in the diet. To test for an effect of piscivorous diet
   in nature, we constructed patch reefs that emitted scents of dietary
   cues in natural concentrations. Patches that emitted scent of a
   piscivorous diet received on average 22\% less settlement than control
   patches or than patches that emitted scent of an herbivore or
   invertivore. Chemosensory detection of recent prey provides a robust cue
   to assess predation risk associated with a diverse range of fishes
   (especially during settlement) and may be reinforced through additional
   sensory (e. g. visual) and learned recognition of individual species
   consistently associated with these distinctive chemosensory cues. (C)

Abstract = {{Strong evidence linking poor diet and lack of physical activity to risk
   of obesity and related chronic disease has supported the development and
   promotion of guidelines to improve population health. Still, obesity
   continues to escalate as a major health concern, and so the impact of
   weight-related guidelines on behaviour is unclear. The aim of this
   review was to examine consumer response to weight-related guidelines. A
   systematic literature search was performed using Medline, PsycInfo,
   ProQuest Central and additional searches using Google and reference
   lists. Of the 1,765 articles identified, 46 relevant titles were
   included. Most studies examined attitudes towards content, source,
   tailoring and comprehension of dietary guidelines. Many respondents
   reported that guidelines were confusing, and that simple, clear,
   specific, realistic, and in some cases, tailored guidelines are
   required. Recognition of guidelines did not signify understanding nor
   did perceived credibility of a source guarantee utilization of
   guidelines. There was a lack of studies assessing: the impact of
   guidelines on behaviour; responses to physical activity guidelines;
   responses among males and studies undertaken in developing countries.
   Further research is needed, in particular regarding responses to
   physical activity guidelines and guidelines in different populations.
   Communication professionals should assist health professionals in the
   development of accurate and effective weight-related guidelines.}},

Title = {{Adaptive strategies for managing uncertainty may explain
   personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1009-1020}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that individuals within populations show
   consistent differences in their behaviour across contexts (personality),
   and that personality is associated with the extent to which individuals
   adjust their behaviour as function of changing conditions (behavioural
   plasticity). We propose an evolutionary explanation for a link between
   personality and plasticity based upon how individuals manage
   uncertainty. Individuals can employ three categories of tactics to
   manage uncertainty. They can 1) gather information (sample) to reduce
   uncertainty, 2) show strategic (state-dependent) preferences for options
   that differ in their associated variances in rewards (i.e.
   variance-sensitivity), or 3) invest in insurance to mitigate the
   consequences of uncertainty. We explicitly outline how individual
   differences in the use of any of these tactics can generate
   personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity. For example,
   sampling effort is likely to co-vary with individual activity and
   exploration behaviours, while simultaneously creating population
   variation in reactions to changes in environmental conditions.
   Individual differences in the use of insurance may be associated with
   differences in risk-taking behaviours, such as boldness in the face of
   predation, thereby influencing the degree of adaptive plasticity across
   individuals. Population variation in responsiveness to environmental
   changes may also reflect individual differences in variance-sensitivity,
   because stochastic change in the environment increases variances in
   rewards, which may both attract and benefit variance-prone individuals,
   but not variance-averse individuals. We review the existing evidence
   that individual variation in strategies for managing uncertainty exist,
   and describe how positive-feedbacks between sampling,
   variance-sensitivity and insurance can maintain and exaggerate even
   small initial differences between individuals in the relative use of
   these tactics. Given the pervasiveness of the problem of uncertainty,
   alternative strategies for managing uncertainty may provide a powerful
   explanation for consistent differences in behaviour and behavioural
   plasticity for a wide range of traits.}},

Abstract = {{1. Environmental conditions in the present, more recent past and during
   the juvenile stage can have significant effects on adult performance and
   population dynamics, but their relative importance and potential
   interactions remain unexplored. 2. We examined the influence of food
   availability at the time of sampling, 2 months prior and during the
   juvenile stage on adult somatic growth rates in wild Trinidadian guppies
   (Poecilia reticulata). 3. We found that food availability during both
   the early and later parts of an individuals ontogeny had important
   consequences for adult growth strategies, but the direction of these
   effects differed among life stages and their magnitude, in some cases,
   depended on food levels experienced during other life stages. Current
   food levels and those 2 months prior to growth measurements had positive
   effects on adult growth rate; though, food levels 2 months prior had a
   greater effect on growth than current food levels. In contrast, the
   effects of food availability during the juvenile stage were higher in
   magnitude but opposite in direction to current food levels and those 2
   months prior to growth rate measurements. Individuals recruiting under
   low food levels grew faster as adults than individuals recruiting during
   periods of high food availability. There was also a positive interaction
   between food levels experienced during the juvenile stage and 2 months
   prior such that the effects of juvenile food level diminished as the
   food level experienced 2 months prior increased. 4. These results
   suggest that the similar conditions occurring at different life stages
   can have different effects on short- and long-term growth strategies of
   individuals within a population. They also demonstrate that, while
   juvenile conditions can have lasting effects on adult performance, the
   strength of that effect can be dampened by environmental conditions
   experienced as an adult. 5. A simultaneous consideration of past events
   in both the adult and juvenile stage may therefore improve predictions
   for individual- and population-level responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{1. Individual- and population-level variation in body size and growth
   often correlates with many fitness traits. Predation and food
   availability are expected to affect body size and growth as important
   agents of both natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. How
   differences in predation and food availability affect body size/growth
   during ontogeny in populations adapted to different predation and
   competition regimes is rarely studied. 2. Nine-spined stickleback
   (Pungitius pungitius) populations originating from habitats with varying
   levels of predation and competition are known to be locally adapted to
   their respective habitats in terms of body size and growth. Here, we
   studied how different levels of perceived predation risk and competition
   during ontogeny affect the reaction norms of body size and growth in (i)
   marine and pond populations adapted to different levels of predation and
   competition and (ii) different sexes. We reared nine-spined stickleback
   in a factorial experiment under two levels of perceived predation risk
   (present/absent) and competition (high/low food supply). 3. We found
   divergence in the reaction norms at two levels: (i) predation-adapted
   marine stickleback had stronger reactions to predatory cues than
   intraspecific competition-adapted pond stickleback, the latter being
   more sensitive to available food than the marine fish and (ii) females
   reacting more strongly to the treatments than males. 4. The repeated,
   habitat-dependent nature of the differences suggests that natural
   selection is the agent behind the observed patterns. Our results suggest
   that genetic adaptation to certain environmental factors also involves
   an increase in the range of expressible phenotypic plasticity. We found
   support for this phenomenon at two levels: (i) across populations driven
   by habitat type and (ii) within populations driven by sex.}},

Abstract = {{1. Climate warming has led to shifts in the seasonal timing of species.
   These shifts can differ across trophic levels, and as a result, predator
   phenology can get out of synchrony with prey phenology. This can have
   major consequences for predators such as population declines owing to
   low reproductive success. However, such trophic interactions are likely
   to differ between habitats, resulting in differential susceptibility of
   populations to increases in spring temperatures. A mismatch between
   breeding phenology and food abundance might be mitigated by dietary
   changes, but few studies have investigated this phenomenon. Here, we
   present data on nestling diets of nine different populations of pied
   flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca, across their breeding range. This
   species has been shown to adjust its breeding phenology to local climate
   change, but sometimes insufficiently relative to the phenology of their
   presumed major prey: Lepidoptera larvae. In spring, such larvae have a
   pronounced peak in oak habitats, but to a much lesser extent in
   coniferous and other deciduous habitats. 2. We found strong seasonal
   declines in the proportions of caterpillars in the diet only for oak
   habitats, and not for the other forest types. The seasonal decline in
   oak habitats was most strongly observed in warmer years, indicating that
   potential mismatches were stronger in warmer years. However, in
   coniferous and other habitats, no such effect of spring temperature was
   found. 3. Chicks reached somewhat higher weights in broods provided with
   higher proportions of caterpillars, supporting the notion that
   caterpillars are an important food source and that the temporal match
   with the caterpillar peak may represent an important component of
   reproductive success. 4. We suggest that pied flycatchers breeding in
   oak habitats have greater need to adjust timing of breeding to rising
   spring temperatures, because of the strong seasonality in their food.
   Such between-habitat differences can have important consequences for
   population dynamics and should be taken into account in studies on
   phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to climate change.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Heightened stress reactivity is associated with hippocampal
   atrophy, age-related cognitive deficits, and increased risk for
   Alzheimer's disease. This temperament predisposition may aggravate
   age-associated brain pathology or be reflective of it. This association
   may be mediated through repeated activation of the stress hormone axis
   over time. Dietary interventions, such as calorie restriction (CR),
   affect stress biology and may moderate the pathogenic relationship
   between stress reactivity and brain in limbic and prefrontal regions.
   Methods: Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) aged 19-31 years consumed
   either a standard diet (N = 18) or were maintained on 30\% CR relative
   to baseline intake (N = 26) for 13-19 years. Behavior was rated in both
   normative and aversive contexts. Urinary cortisol was collected. Animals
   underwent magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   to acquire volumetric and tissue microstructure data respectively.
   Voxel-wise statistics regressed a global stress reactivity factor,
   cortisol, and their interaction on brain indices across and between
   dietary groups.
   Results: CR significantly reduced stress reactivity during aversive
   contexts without affecting activity, orientation, or attention behavior.
   Stress reactivity was associated with less volume and tissue density in
   areas important for emotional regulation and the endocrine axis
   including prefrontal cortices, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus.
   CR reduced these relationships. A Cortisol by Stress Reactivity
   voxel-wise interaction indicated that only monkeys with high stress
   reactivity and high basal cortisol demonstrated lower brain volume and
   tissue density in prefrontal cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala.
   Conclusions: High stress reactivity predicted lower volume and
   microstructural tissue density in regions involved in emotional
   processing and modulation. A CR diet reduced stress reactivity and
   regional associations with neural modalities. High levels of cortisol
   appear to mediate some of these relationships. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we lay out the theoretical framework for using modeling
   approaches from behavioral ecology (in particular, state-dependent and

   individual-based models of the state-dependent behavior of individual
   central place foragers over the course of a breeding season and show how
   our approach provides a framework for the prediction of trip lengths,
   foraging location, food delivery, and reproductive success. We formulate
   a common framework of models for northern fur seals (Callorhinus
   ursinus), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and thick-billed
   murres (Uria lomvia), and provide worked examples parameterized to
   represent fur seals and murres. We then develop a game theoretic model
   at the colony-level for predicting the distribution of multiple
   individuals across space in the face of potential interference or
   facilitation, providing a worked example for kittiwakes. We demonstrate
   how these models can be used to predict near-term aspects of foraging
   behavior such as diet choice and trip destinations and durations at the
   individual and colony level. We show how (i) behavioral predictions can
   be translated into predictions of foraging success, (ii) foraging
   success can be scaled up to demographically relevant parameters such as
   survival and reproduction, and (iii) this approach can help predict

   Results: The time it took to develop the curriculum exceeded initial
   estimates. However, the extra time taken was spent engaging in needed

   presumably more direct link between food resources and many aspects of
   behavior and natural history. We experimentally investigated the
   relationship between food intake and spatial behavior in a population of
   the snake Bothrops asper in a Costa Rican lowland rainforest. Six adult
   snakes were allowed to forage naturally while six were offered
   supplemental food in the field, with both groups monitored using
   radiotelemetry. Mean home range size did not differ between groups
   presumably due to small sample size, but supplementally fed snakes
   demonstrated altered patterns of macro- and microhabitat selection,
   shorter and less frequent movements, and increased mass acquisition. Fed
   snakes also devoted less time to foraging efforts, instead more
   frequently remaining inactive and utilizing shelter. Because snakes were
   always fed in situ and not at designated feeding stations, observed
   shifts in habitat selection are not explained by animals simply moving
   to areas of higher food availability. Rather. B. asper may have moved to
   swamps in order to feed on amphibians when necessary, but remained in
   preferred forest habitat when food was otherwise abundant. The strong
   behavioral and spatiotemporal responses of snakes in this population may
   have been influenced by an overall scarcity of mammalian prey during the
   study period. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural innovations may have far-reaching evolutionary and
   ecological consequences, allowing individuals to obtain new resources
   and cope with environmental change. However, as innovations are rarely
   observed in nature, their emergence is poorly understood. What drives
   individuals to innovate, and what psychological mechanisms allow them to
   do so? We used three novel food extraction tasks to address these
   questions in groups of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Innovatory
   tendencies were unrelated to body condition and foraging success, but
   were affected by age, rank and sex. Juvenile individuals were most
   likely to interact with tasks, but seldom solved them, perhaps owing to
   their small size or lack of dexterity. Instead, adult subordinates made
   up the bulk of the innovators. In cooperatively breeding societies, the
   inability of subordinate helpers to compete physically with dominant
   breeders may drive them to seek out solutions to novel problems. Most
   innovators were males, which, as the dispersing sex, may be particularly
   prone to solve novel problems, and innovators virtually always persisted
   longer than other group members when interacting with tasks. Most
   successful individuals solved tasks more than once, and learned to
   inhibit ineffective prepotent responses across successive presentations
   of the same task. They did not learn to manipulate functional parts of
   the apparatus more efficiently, however, nor did they extract general
   rules allowing them to solve novel tasks faster. Contrary to recent
   suggestions that innovation may be cognitively demanding, these results
   suggest that simple, conserved learning processes and dogged
   perseverance may suffice to generate solutions to novel problems. (c)

Abstract = {{The relationship between food restriction and subsequent dysregulation
   of food intake is complex, variable and long-lasting. The present study
   investigated in rats whether repeated cycles of food restriction and
   binge feeding opportunities may alter regulation of food intake by
   employing a test for sensory-specific satiety. Rats that experienced
   repeated food restriction-binge cycles maintained heavier body weights
   compared to rats that remained on continuous food restriction. In
   contrast to the control subjects, rats that alternated between food
   restriction and binge feeding failed to display sensory-specific
   satiety. During the first meal, there was a gradual decrease in the
   amount of food intake over a 40 min period. When presented with a second
   meal of the same food, these rats responded to the familiar food in a
   manner similar as to a novel food (i.e., comparable quantities of both
   types of food were consumed). Food restriction-binge feeding cycles may
   be considered as a form of stress, which in turn is associated with
   cross-sensitization to numerous behavioral responses. Therefore, we
   propose that stress-induced disruption of sensory-specific satiety
   reflects a sensitized response to food, in which the interaction between
   sensory and satiety factors are no longer the key regulators of food
   choice and meal cessation. Furthermore, a role for sensory-specific
   satiety in terminating food intake appeared to decline with the
   progression of the cycles, thereby contributing to a steady increase in
   body weight of rats that experienced restriction with bouts of binge
   feeding opportunities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the present study was to determine whether mothers'
   assessment of their infants' temperament is associated with objective
   measures of the infant's acceptance patterns and their judgments of the
   infants' liking of a green vegetable. To this end, infants (N = 92) were
   video-recorded as their mothers fed them green beans. From these videos,
   we determined the frequency of facial distaste expressions made during
   the first 2 min of the feeding. Other measures included intake, maternal
   ratings of infants' enjoyment of this vegetable, and temperament.
   Infants who scored high on the approach dimension of the temperament
   questionnaire were less likely to express facial expressions of
   distaste, consumed more food, and were perceived by their mothers as
   enjoying the food more. Mediation analyses revealed that ratings of
   enjoyment were not directly related to the child's approach temperament,
   but rather the relationship between mothers' ratings and temperament was
   mediated by the amount of time infants spent eating the vegetable.
   Regression analyses suggested that in addition to the length of time
   children ate, mothers' ratings of their infants' enjoyment was predicted
   by the number of squints that the infant expressed during the meal.
   These findings suggest that although certain aspects of children's
   temperament are related to their food acceptance, mothers attend to
   facial expressions and time spent eating independently of these
   temperamental characteristics when judging their infant's enjoyment of a
   food. Understanding how mothers use this information to decide which
   foods to feed their infants is an important area for future research.

Abstract = {{Aphids increase production of winged individuals as a generalized

   combined threats lead to additive or non-additive outcomes. We tested
   the interactive effects of predation risk and plant quality on
   population growth and wing induction in the potato aphid, Macrosiphum
   euphorbiae. Plant quality was varied using phytohormonal manipulations
   of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) to elevate or suppress the jasmonate
   and salicylate defense pathways. Predation risk was altered by exposing
   aphids to lethal or risk (unable to feed) individuals of the convergent
   lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens. Phytohormonal treatments resulted in
   > 4-fold variation in aphid population growth and thus strongly affected
   plant quality; however, the percentage of winged individuals was no
   different across plant types. Predators similarly reduced aphid
   abundance, but also elicited a similar to 3-fold increase in wing
   formation, an effect that was similar in magnitude when comparing lethal
   with risk predators. The overall impact of plants and predators on
   aphids was largely additive, an outcome that was unexpected given the
   likelihood for interactions between these two factors and our prior
   results with other herbivores in this system. We discuss this
   discrepancy in the context of phenotypic plasticity, non-lethal predator
   effects, and the ecological challenges faced by wing dimorphic insects.}},

Abstract = {{The relative scarcity of studies at the intersection of behavioral and

   behavior in density-dependent population regulation. Here we tested
   whether North American red squirrels () adjust their behavior in
   response to local population density and whether they use rates of
   territorial vocalizations in their local neighborhood to assess density.
   We examined these relationships using 18 years of live trapping and 20
   years of behavioral data that were collected across natural variation in
   local population density. To disentangle the effects of population
   density on behavior from those due to changes in per capita food
   abundance or changes in the frequency of antagonistic interactions with
   neighbors, we also experimentally manipulated population density with
   long-term food supplementation as well as perceived population density
   with long-term playbacks of territorial vocalizations. The frequency
   with which squirrels emitted territorial vocalizations was positively
   associated with local population density. In contrast, antagonistic
   physical interactions observed between squirrels and territorial
   intrusions were rare and the frequency of intrusions was weakly and
   negatively, not positively, associated with population density.
   Squirrels experiencing naturally and experimentally high density
   conditions spent less time in the nest and feeding but more time being
   vigilant. Similar density-dependent changes in behavior were observed in
   response to our manipulations of perceived population density,
   indicating that vocalization rates and not physical interactions or food
   abundance were the mechanism by which squirrels assessed and responded
   behaviorally to changes in local density.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions early in life can affect an organism's
   phenotype at adulthood, which may be tuned to perform optimally in
   conditions that mimic those experienced during development
   (Environmental Matching hypothesis), or may be generally superior when
   conditions during development were of higher quality (Silver Spoon
   hypothesis). Here, we tested these hypotheses by examining how diet
   during development interacted with diet during adulthood to affect adult
   sexually selected ornamentation and immune function in male mallard
   ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards have yellow, carotenoid-pigmented
   beaks that are used in mate choice, and the degree of beak coloration
   has been linked to adult immune function. Using a 2x2 factorial
   experimental design, we reared mallards on diets containing either low
   or high levels of carotenoids (nutrients that cannot be synthesized de
   novo) throughout the period of growth, and then provided adults with one
   of these two diets while simultaneously quantifying beak coloration and
   response to a variety of immune challenges. We found that both
   developmental and adult carotenoid supplementation increased circulating
   carotenoid levels during dietary treatment, but that birds that received
   low-carotenoid diets during development maintained relatively higher
   circulating carotenoid levels during an adult immune challenge.
   Individuals that received low levels of carotenoids during development
   had larger phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced cutaneous immune responses
   at adulthood; however, dietary treatment during development and
   adulthood did not affect antibody response to a novel antigen, nitric
   oxide production, natural antibody levels, hemolytic capacity of the
   plasma, or beak coloration. However, beak coloration prior to immune
   challenges positively predicted PHA response, and strong PHA responses
   were correlated with losses in carotenoid-pigmented coloration. In sum,
   we did not find consistent support for either the Environmental Matching
   or Silver Spoon hypotheses. We then describe a new hypothesis that
   should be tested in future studies examining developmental plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to
   individual life histories and to environmental variation. The
   reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether
   individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive
   options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and
   anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis,
   however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration
   behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits
   (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk.
   Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor
   quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10
   m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be
   highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of
   time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality
   food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG
   changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments.
   This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to
   EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among
   individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the
   trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population,
   and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play
   important roles in the evolution of personality.}},

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Organisms perceive changes in their dietary environment and enact a
   suite of behavioral and metabolic adaptations that can impact
   motivational behavior, disease resistance, and longevity. However, the
   precise nature and mechanism of these dietary responses is not known. We
   have uncovered a novel link between dietary factors and sleep behavior
   in Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary sugar rapidly altered sleep behavior
   by modulating the number of sleep episodes during both the light and
   dark phase of the circadian period, independent of an intact circadian
   rhythm and without affecting total sleep, latency to sleep, or waking
   activity. The effect of sugar on sleep episode number was consistent
   with a change in arousal threshold for waking. Dietary protein had no
   significant effect on sleep or wakefulness. Gustatory perception of
   sugar was necessary and sufficient to increase the number of sleep
   episodes, and this effect was blocked by activation of bitter-sensing
   neurons. Further addition of sugar to the diet blocked the effects of
   sweet gustatory perception through a gustatory-independent mechanism.
   However, gustatory perception was not required for diet-induced fat
   accumulation, indicating that sleep and energy storage are
   mechanistically separable. We propose a two-component model where
   gustatory and metabolic cues interact to regulate sleep architecture in
   response to the quantity of sugar available from dietary sources.
   Reduced arousal threshold in response to low dietary availability may
   have evolved to provide increased responsiveness to cues associated with
   alternative nutrient-dense feeding sites. These results provide evidence
   that gustatory perception can alter arousal thresholds for sleep
   behavior in response to dietary cues and provide a mechanism by which
   organisms tune their behavior and physiology to environmental cues.}},

Abstract = {{Polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) depend on sea ice for
   catching marine mammal prey. Recent sea-ice declines have been linked to
   reductions in body condition, survival, and population size. Reduced
   foraging opportunity is hypothesized to be the primary cause of
   sea-ice-linked declines, but the costs of travel through a deteriorated
   sea-ice environment also may be a factor. We used movement data from 52
   adult female polar bears wearing Global Positioning System (GPS)
   collars, including some with dependent young, to document long-distance
   swimming (>50 km) by polar bears in the southern Beaufort and Chukchi
   seas. During 6 years (2004-2009), we identified 50 long-distance swims
   by 20 bears. Swim duration and distance ranged from 0.7 to 9.7 days
   (mean = 3.4 days) and 53.7 to 687.1 km (mean = 154.2 km), respectively.
   Frequency of swimming appeared to increase over the course of the study.
   We show that adult female polar bears and their cubs are capable of
   swimming long distances during periods when extensive areas of open
   water are present. However, long-distance swimming appears to have
   higher energetic demands than moving over sea ice. Our observations
   suggest long-distance swimming is a behavioral response to declining
   summer sea-ice conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness, a measure of an individual's propensity for taking risks, is
   an important determinant of fitness but is not necessarily a fixed
   trait. Dependent upon an individual's state, and given certain contexts
   or challenges, individuals may be able to alter their inclination to be
   bold or shy in response. Furthermore, the degree to which individuals
   can modulate their behaviour has been linked with physiological
   responses to stress. Here we attempted to determine whether bold and shy
   rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, can exhibit behavioural plasticity
   in response to changes in state (nutritional availability) and context
   (predation threat). Individual trout were initially assessed for
   boldness using a standard novel object paradigm; subsequently, each day
   for one week fish experienced either predictable, unpredictable, or no
   simulated predator threat in combination with a high (2\% body weight)
   or low (0.15\%) food ration, before being reassessed for boldness. Bold
   trout were generally more plastic, altering levels of neophobia and
   activity relevant to the challenge, whereas shy trout were more fixed
   and remained shy. Increased predation risk generally resulted in an
   increase in the expression of three candidate genes linked to boldness,
   appetite regulation and physiological stress responses - ependymin,
   corticotrophin releasing factor and GABAA - but did not produce a
   significant increase in plasma cortisol. The results suggest a
   divergence in the ability of bold and shy trout to alter their
   behavioural profiles in response to internal and exogenous factors, and
   have important implications for our understanding of the maintenance of
   different behavioural phenotypes in natural populations. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To identify health-related behaviors associated with
   potentially harmful dietary supplements (DS) - body building (BB),
   weight loss (WL) and performance enhancing (PE), explore common reasons
   and sources of information for DS use.
   METHODS: Based on the 2005 Survey of 16,146 U.S. military personnel, BB
   users were dichotomized as yes (regular use - taking any supplement of
   BB at least once a week in past 12 months) or no; similarly defined for
   WL and PE. Weighted logistic regression models are used.
   RESULTS: BB, WL and PE were used by 19.4\%, 17.0\%, and 8.0\% of
   participants, respectively. Significantly more users were overweight or
   obese: BMI >= 25 (vs. BMI <25); heavy drinkers (vs. abstainers); and
   users of taking steroids in their lifetime (vs. not). Most common
   reasons of BB, WL, and PE users wanted to increase muscle mass, lose
   weight, and improve physical performance (BB: 45.8\%, WL: 54.8\%, PE:
   38.5\%). Fewer than 30\% discussed dietary supplements use with their
   healthcare providers. The leading source of dietary supplements
   information (BB: 27.8\%, WL: 23.6\%, PE: 30.0\%) was magazines.

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have shown that prenatal exposure to the
   Dutch famine is associated with an increased risk for several
   psychiatric disorders. Variation in personality characteristics and in
   stress appraisal may underlie mental disorders.
   Aims: To investigate whether prenatal famine exposure is associated with
   personality characteristics and stress appraisal.
   Study design: Cohort study.
   Subjects: Participants included a total of 572 men and women, born as
   term singletons in a local hospital in Amsterdam around the time of the
   1944-1945 Dutch famine.
   Outcome measures: Scores on the Big Five Inventory and the Perceived
   Stress Scale (PSS).
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the
   personality traits openness. conscientiousness, extraversion,
   agreeableness and neuroticism or in PSS scores between those unexposed
   and those exposed to famine during early, mid or late gestation.
   However, there were statistically significant (P = 0.01) and borderline
   significant interactions (P = 0.07) respectively between exposure to
   famine during early gestation and sex on conscientiousness and
   agreeableness. Subsequent analyses showed that men exposed to famine
   during early gestation had lower conscientiousness scores and women
   exposed during early gestation had higher agreeableness scores.
   Conclusions: We conclude that conscientiousness and agreeableness may
   differ between men and women unexposed and exposed to famine during
   early gestation. As evidence was not very robust, future research should
   confirm the present findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Individual behaviors of animals do not evolve separately; they do so in

   physiological constraints and/or favored by selection. Thus, measuring
   behavioral syndromes-suites of correlated behaviors across different
   contexts-leads to a better understanding of the adaptive significance of
   variations in behaviors. However, relatively few studies have examined
   behavioral syndromes in wild animal populations in changing
   environments. We investigated a potential behavioral syndrome across
   antipredator nest defense, territorial defense, chick provisioning, and
   mating behaviors of male Black-tailed Gulls Larus crassirostris in two
   successive years under different conspecific territorial intrusion risks
   and food conditions. Males that presented high levels of antipredator
   nest defense (aggressive antipredator defenders) against a crow decoy
   (crows are egg predators) defended their territories against conspecific
   intruders more frequently than did other males (nonaggressive
   antipredator defenders), independent of the risk of intrusion.
   Aggressive antipredator defenders also fed their chicks more frequently
   than nonaggressive males, but only in a year of low food availability.
   Taken together, this indicates that males show consistent aggressiveness
   regardless of breeding context (antipredator and territorial defense),
   but can regulate food provisioning according to food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Some evidence exists that cow body condition score (BCS) is associated
   with risks to animal health, and that higher BCS in extensively kept
   animals provides a buffer against cold conditions or other adverse
   weather events. Not surprisingly, measures of BCS feature in dairy
   cattle welfare assessment protocols. However, the degree to which BCS
   predicts welfare state, particularly in relation to the level of
   ``hunger{''} experienced, is not well researched. The aim of this study
   was to examine associations between naturally arising variations in BCS
   in dairy cattle and time spent engaged in activities used as proxy
   indicators of hunger. Holstein-Friesian cows (n = 113) of either North
   American or New Zealand ancestry were allocated to 1 of 3 levels of
   concentrate-feed supplementation (0, 3, or 6 kg of dry matter/d) and
   also offered pasture in excess of requirements. Body condition score (1
   to 10 scale), pasture dry matter intake (DMI), and time budgets for
   grazing, ruminating, standing, and lying were recorded during early,
   mid, and late lactation. Body condition score varied over a wide range
   (2.5 to 8.5) and, within genetic strain and supplementation level, was
   inversely associated with pasture DMI, rate of DMI, and the proportions
   of time spent grazing and ruminating. In comparison, variation in BCS
   (within genetic strain and supplementation level) was directly
   associated with variations in time spent lying (in late lactation).
   Nevertheless, pasture DMI and time spent in the key behavioral
   activities were all within the normal expected limits for pasture-fed
   dairy cows. Thus, thin cows appeared able to achieve their nutritional
   requirements. Furthermore, even though thinner cows traded-off a small
   portion of their lying time in late lactation to forage longer, they
   still rested for normal periods each day. Based on these results, we
   found no difference in the welfare status of naturally thin and fat cows
   when they were offered generous pasture allowances with or without
   concentrate supplementation. The extent to which this pertains under
   conditions of persistently low feed allowances that result in reductions
   in BCS remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Male courtship behaviour is known to correlate with body condition and
   other aspects of male phenotypic or genetic quality. Females often
   prefer males that express the most intense or elaborate displays,
   although recent findings indicate that this should not always be the
   case; males may be strategic in their courtship displays, signal
   dishonestly or deplete their energy reserves with intense courting. To
   study reliability of courtship effort as a mate choice signal, I
   assessed multiple aspects of male courtship using wild-caught sand
   gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus, in a controlled laboratory setting. I
   found consistent and repeatable between-male differences in courtship.
   However, females did not show a significant preference for males that
   courted intensively. Furthermore, other assessed male traits with a
   previously demonstrated role in sexual selection were not correlated
   with courtship effort. This indicates that courtship displays did not
   reliably signal male quality. The results also suggest that even when
   courtship has potential to convey useful information, females may have
   to trade between courtship and other cues they use in mate choice.
   Hence, to gain a more complete understanding of the selection regime
   acting on male courtship behaviour, and female preference for it, one
   should simultaneously investigate multiple factors that can affect
   female mating behaviour. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Compensatory growth and catch-up growth are often used
   interchangeably to describe the faster than optimal growth that occurs
   following a period of dietary restriction in the development of many
   animals. Concerns about the statistical analysis of these studies have
   drawn attention to the risk of false detection in reports of
   compensatory and catch-up growth.
   2. This study aims to quantify the degree to which these compensatory
   responses occur across the animal kingdom. In addition, this study
   distinguishes the two terms, `compensatory growth' and `catch-up
   growth', to clarify the fitness consequences of rapid growth.
   Compensatory growth refers to a faster than usual growth rate, while
   catch-up growth implies attainment of control size.
   3. Eight meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted on
   data extracted from 88 papers, including 11 taxonomic classes. The
   results confirmed that both growth tactics (i.e. compensatory and
   catch-up growth) occur across a wide range of taxa and result in
   decreased direct fitness components.
   4. Importantly, the meta-analytic methods used made it possible to
   identify the specific experimental techniques that most successfully
   promoted rapid growth after restriction and key differences in the
   responses of the four major groups (mammals, birds, fish and arthropods)
   to dietary restriction. Endotherms are more likely to show a
   compensatory growth response because of their determinate growth; in
   contrast, the indeterminate and saltatory growth tactics of fish and
   arthropods reduce the pressure to rapidly achieve a large size.
   5. Among the first meta-analyses to be conducted in this field, this
   study provides valuable support for the premises of compensatory and
   catch-up growth and also discusses weaknesses in experimental design,
   and possible solutions, in compensatory growth research. For example, we
   recommend conducting the experiment within the most linear phase of an
   animal's growth to avoid analytical complications arising from
   size-dependent growth, and our results indicate that dietary dilution
   more closely resembles quantitative restriction than clutch size and
   intermittent feeding restriction methods when normal quantitative
   restriction is not possible.}},

Abstract = {{Net energy availability depends on plasma corticosterone concentrations,
   food availability, and their interaction. Limited net energy
   availability requires energy trade-offs between self-maintenance and
   reproduction. This is important in matrotrophic viviparous animals
   because they provide large amounts of energy for embryos, as well as
   self-maintenance, for the extended period of time during gestation. In
   addition, gravid females may transmit environmental information to the
   embryos in order to adjust offspring phenotype. We investigated effects
   of variation in maternal plasma corticosterone concentration and
   maternal food availability (2 x 2 factorial design) during gestation on
   offspring phenotype in a matrotrophic viviparous lizard (Pseudemoia
   entrecasteauxii). Subsequently, we tested preadaptation of offspring
   phenotype to their postnatal environment by measuring risk-averse
   behavior and growth rate using reciprocal transplant experiments. We
   found that maternal net energy availability affected postpartum maternal
   body condition, offspring snout-vent length, offspring mass, offspring
   performance ability, and offspring fat reserves. Females treated with
   corticosterone allocated large amounts of energy to their own body
   condition, and their embryos allocated more energy to energy reserves
   than somatic growth. Further, offspring from females in high plasma
   corticosterone concentration showed compensatory growth. These findings
   suggest that while females may be selfish when gestation conditions are
   stressful, the embryos may adjust their phenotype to cope with the
   postnatal environment.}},

   Conclusions: DELIGHT shows that flexible control characterizes
   individuals with a higher dietary quality, a lower waist circumference
   and a lower glucose level. Enhancing flexible control more than rigid
   control, and decreasing disinhibition, seems beneficial in terms of
   central adiposity and glucose levels.}},

Title = {{Prenatal Factors Contribute to the Emergence of Kwashiorkor or Marasmus
   in Severe Undernutrition: Evidence for the Predictive Adaptation Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Severe acute malnutrition in childhood manifests as
   oedematous (kwashiorkor, marasmic kwashiorkor) and non-oedematous
   (marasmus) syndromes with very different prognoses. Kwashiorkor differs
   from marasmus in the patterns of protein, amino acid and lipid
   metabolism when patients are acutely ill as well as after rehabilitation
   to ideal weight for height. Metabolic patterns among marasmic patients
   define them as metabolically thrifty, while kwashiorkor patients
   function as metabolically profligate. Such differences might underlie
   syndromic presentation and prognosis. However, no fundamental
   explanation exists for these differences in metabolism, nor clinical
   pictures, given similar exposures to undernutrition. We hypothesized
   that different developmental trajectories underlie these
   clinical-metabolic phenotypes: if so this would be strong evidence in
   support of predictive adaptation model of developmental plasticity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed the records of all children
   admitted with severe acute malnutrition to the Tropical Metabolism
   Research Unit Ward of the University Hospital of the West Indies,
   Kingston, Jamaica during 1962-1992. We used Wellcome criteria to
   establish the diagnoses of kwashiorkor (n = 391), marasmus (n = 383),
   and marasmic-kwashiorkor (n = 375). We recorded participants' birth
   weights, as determined from maternal recall at the time of admission.
   Those who developed kwashiorkor had 333 g (95\% confidence interval 217
   to 449, p<0.001) higher mean birthweight than those who developed
   marasmus.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data are consistent with a model
   suggesting that plastic mechanisms operative in utero induce potential
   marasmics to develop with a metabolic physiology more able to adapt to
   postnatal undernutrition than those of higher birthweight. Given the
   different mortality risks of these different syndromes, this observation
   is supportive of the predictive adaptive response hypothesis and is the
   first empirical demonstration of the advantageous effects of such a
   response in humans. The study has implications for understanding
   pathways to obesity and its cardio-metabolic co-morbidities in poor
   countries and for famine intervention programs.}},

   ecosystem dynamics}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{231}},
Pages = {{87-100}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between
   adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship
   with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment.
   Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex
   interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems,
   particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental
   conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape
   and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics
   as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes
   and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i)
   to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate
   spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large
   scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use,
   and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands
   ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest
   ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory,
   iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the
   landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived,
   size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a
   hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at
   stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled
   to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on
   allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are
   modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior
   of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we
   conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a
   longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results
   against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4\% of
   variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This
   transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of
   species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness
   and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully
   evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth
   forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our
   approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was
   demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the
   emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex
   process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to
   contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest
   ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions. 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies have displayed increased interest in
   examining the relationship between personality traits and the onset,
   treatment response patterns, and relapse of depression. This study aimed
   to examine whether or not harm avoidance (HA) was a risk factor for
   postpartum depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
   Scale (EPDS) and the state dependency of HA.
   Methods: Pregnant women (n = 460; mean age 31.9 +/- 4.2 years) who
   participated in a prenatal program completed the EPDS as a measure of
   depressive state and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) as a
   measure of HA during three periods: early pregnancy (T1), late pregnancy
   (around 36 weeks), and 1 month postpartum (T2). Changes in EPDS and HA
   scores from T1 to T2 were compared between the non depressive (ND) group
   and the postpartum depressive (PD) group.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the level of HA between
   the ND and PD groups at T1. In the ND group, EPDS and HA scores did not
   change significantly from T1 to T2. In the PD group, both scores
   increased significantly from T1 to T2 (EPDS, p<0.0001; HA, p<0.048). In
   the ND and PD groups, a significant positive correlation was observed in
   changes in EPDS and HA scores from T1 to T2 (r = 0.31, p = 0.002).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that HA cannot be considered a risk
   factor for the development of postpartum depression measured by EPDS.
   Furthermore, HA may be state dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the independent and synergistic effects of

   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Flushing, New York.
   Participants: A total of 212 preschool children as a part the ongoing
   cohort study.
   Main Exposures: Gestational diabetes mellitus and low SES.
   Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes are ADHD diagnosis based on
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
   criteria at age 6 years and several well-validated measures of
   neurobehavioral outcomes, cognitive functioning, ADHD symptoms, and
   temperament at age 4 years. Secondary outcomes are parent and teacher
   reports of behavioral and emotional problems at age 6 years.
   Neurobehavioral measures in relation to GDM and low SES were examined
   using generalized estimating equations and multivariate logistic
   regression analyses.
   Results: Both maternal GDM and low SES were associated with an
   approximately 2-fold increased risk for ADHD at age 6 years. However,
   the risk by GDM was greater among lower SES families than among higher
   SES families. Children exposed to both GDM and low SES demonstrated
   compromised neurobehavioral functioning, including lower IQ, poorer
   language, and impoverished behavioral and emotional functioning. A test
   of additive interaction found that the risk for ADHD increased over
   14-fold (P=.006) when children were exposed to both GDM and low SES.
   Neither children exposed to maternal GDM alone nor those exposed to low
   SES alone had a notable increased risk for ADHD.
   Conclusions: Maternal GDM and low SES, especially in combination,
   heighten the risk for childhood ADHD. Longterm prevention efforts should
   be directed at mothers with GDM to avoid suboptimal neurobehavioral
   development and mitigate the risk for ADHD among their offspring.}},

Title = {{How the ladybird got its spots: effects of resource limitation on the
   honesty of aposematic signals}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{334-342}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Prey species often possess defences (e.g. toxins) coupled with
   warning signals (i.e. aposematism). There is growing evidence that the
   expression of aposematic signals often varies within species and
   correlates with the strength of chemical defences. This has led to the
   speculation that such signals may be honest, with signal reliability
   ensured by the costliness of producing or maintaining aposematic traits.
   2. We reared larval seven-spot ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata) on
   a Low or High aphid diet and measured the effects on warning signal
   expression (elytral carotenoid pigmentation, conspicuousness, spot
   size), levels of defensive alkaloids (precoccinelline, coccinelline),
   and relationships between these traits.
   3. High-diet individuals had greater total precoccinelline levels, and
   elytra carotenoid concentrations at adulthood which was detectable to a
   typical avian predator. However, larval diet did not significantly
   affect adult body mass or size, spot size or coccinelline levels.
   4. Elytra carotenoid concentrations correlated positively with total
   precoccinelline levels in both diet groups and sexes. However, the
   relationship between elytra carotenoid concentrations and total levels
   of coccinelline depended on sex: in both diet groups, elytra carotenoids
   and coccinelline levels were positively correlated in females, but
   negatively correlated in males. Spot size and coccinelline levels
   correlated positively in Low-diet individuals, but negatively in
   High-diet individuals.
   5. These results point to physiological linkages between components of
   aposematism, which are modulated by resource (i. e. food) availability
   and affect the honesty of signals. Developmental diet, but also sex,
   influenced the relationships between signals and toxin levels. Ladybirds
   are sexually size dimorphic, and thus in comparison with males, females
   may be more susceptible to resource limitation and more likely to be
   honest signallers.}},

Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{154}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{372-378}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the adaptive
   evolution of personality, defined as inter-individual differences in
   behaviour that are consistent over time and across situations. For
   instance, the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that personality
   evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that
   vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher
   exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to
   higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which
   proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains
   poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on
   foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any
   motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged
   this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or
   combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have
   additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the
   Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41\%
   and body condition for about 20\% of the total variation in latency to
   feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency
   to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and
   positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and
   individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a
   period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction
   between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect
   of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the
   relevance of our results in relation to the different factors
   influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a
   life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of
   life-history traits and personality.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological studies of neuroendocrine regulation confirm that
   aggressive behavior patterns are nearly universal in the animal kingdom.
   Different species of fish (e.g. Zebra Fish and Siamese Fighting Fish)
   are used as models for studies of animal behavior, including aggression.
   Despite an increased risk of injury or death, aggression frequently
   offers considerable benefits. It is mainly related with competition for
   limited resources, for example, competition for food or a mate, the
   establishment of territory and dominance hierarchies (a higher social
   status). Aggression is a kind of aversive drive to limit the freedom of
   other animals of the same or other species or to injure or kill them.
   Territorial behavior is a significant problem in farm and companion
   animals, not only causing economic losses but also threatening animal
   health and welfare. The following systems are involved in the regulation
   of aggressive behavior: the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA),
   sympathetico-medullary-adrenal (SAM), hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal,
   serotonin, somatostatin, dopamine, histamine and nitric oxide pathways,
   as well as brain structures responsible for motivation. The aim of this

Abstract = {{Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of
   behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why
   species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The
   West European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in
   part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of
   habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats.
   This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the
   result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used
   radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable
   landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, Meles meles) abundance.
   Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our
   results suggest that agricultural habitats may be `landscapes of fear'
   for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On
   agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge
   cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be
   beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number
   of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by,
   among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural
   areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat
   structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results
   emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and
   food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour

Abstract = {{Chemosensory discrimination of sex and other individual traits based on
   pheromones occurs in many reptiles. However, the use of chemoreception
   in turtle social behaviour is poorly known. We examined the role of
   chemical signals in intraspecific communication of Spanish terrapins,
   Mauremys leprosa, during the breeding season. Chemical cues released by
   terrapins in the water might inform on sex and other individual
   characteristics, such as size, body condition or health state, which are
   important in sexual selection processes. To test this hypothesis, we
   compared the time spent by turtles in water pools containing chemical
   stimuli obtained from different conspecifics. Behavioural responses
   showed that turtles were able to detect and discriminate chemical cues
   released by conspecifics, and to modify their use of space in response
   to these cues alone. Males preferred water pools with chemicals of
   females with greater immune responses, while females preferred water
   pools with odours of larger males. Preferences for water used by better
   potential partners could increase mating opportunities with these
   partners, which would increase offspring fitness. Female preference for
   large males could also be a mechanism of protection from harassment by
   small males. On the other hand, males avoided water pools with chemicals
   of heavier, or relatively heavier, males and preferred water with
   chemicals of smaller, or relatively smaller, males. Chemosensory
   assessment of body size may allow males to minimize the risk of costly
   aggressive interactions with other males. Selection of water pools based
   on chemical cues of conspecifics may allow terrapins to optimize their
   mate searching while avoiding competitors. (C) 2012 The Association for

Abstract = {{Animal populations are often limited by food and rearing offspring is
   energetically demanding. Life history theory predicts that parents of
   altricial bird species will often reduce their current reproductive
   effort when given supplementary food. Previous food supplementation
   studies have mainly focused on effects on female parents, while the
   importance of paternal behaviour has largely been neglected. We
   addressed the effects of natural and experimentally increased food
   abundance on male ranging behaviour and provisioning rate, female and
   fledgling condition, and final reproductive success, in the Tengmalm's
   owl, Aegolius funereus, a species with obligatory biparental care. We
   found that males adjusted their parental effort by reducing provisioning
   rate at food-supplemented nests. Food supplementation induced an
   increase in body mass of females, and in body mass and haematocrit
   levels of fledglings. This suggests that the amount of extra food
   provided was enough for females to increase body condition sufficiently
   to start allocating extra resources to enhance the quality of current
   offspring. While the home range size of radiomarked males was not
   affected by food supplementation, it decreased with cover of spruce
   forest, which is a habitat that is denser in structure and richer in
   prey than pine forest and especially clear-cut areas. This suggests that
   habitat-specific prey abundance and/or cover may be strong determinants
   of home range size for males. Overall, the results provide novel
   insights into how habitat quality and food supply affect male hunting
   behaviour and biparental care, and how this in turn is reflected in
   fledgling condition. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{When females anticipate a hazardous environment for their offspring,
   they can increase offspring survival by producing larger young. Early
   environmental experience determines egg size in different animal taxa.
   We predicted that a higher perceived predation risk by juveniles would
   cause an increase in the sizes of eggs that they produce as adults. To
   test this, we exposed juveniles of the mouthbrooding cichlid Eretmodus
   cyanostictus in a split-brood experiment either to cues of a natural
   predator or to a control situation. After maturation, females that had
   been confronted with predators produced heavier eggs, whereas clutch
   size itself was not affected by the treatment. This effect cannot be
   explained by a differential female body size because the predator
   treatment did not influence growth trajectories. The observed increase
   of egg mass is likely to be adaptive, as heavier eggs gave rise to
   larger young and in fish, juvenile predation risk drops sharply with
   increasing body size. This study provides the first evidence that
   predator cues perceived by females early in life positively affect egg
   mass, suggesting that these cues allow her to predict the predation risk
   for her offspring.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common
   worldwide and cause considerable social and economic burden. The aims of
   SEPAHAN project were to 1) assess the prevalence of different FGIDs
   within an Iranian population, 2) investigate the relationship of FGIDs
   and their symptoms with lifestyle and nutritional factors, and 3)
   investigate the relationship of FGIDs and their symptoms with
   psychological factors. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study among
   staff of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Sciences
   (Isfahan, Iran) and consisted of two main phases. In the first phase, a
   detailed dietary questionnaire was used to assess dietary habits and
   usual dietary intakes. Other lifestyle factors were investigated using
   appropriate questionnaires. In the second phase, the epidemiology of
   different FGIDs was determined using Rome III criteria. In addition,
   different psychological assessment tools were used to screen for
   anxiety, depression, psychological distress, coping styles, stressful
   life events, personality trait, and level of social support.
   Self-administered questionnaires were used in this study. RESULTS: In
   the first and second phases of the study, 8691 and 6239 adults were
   recruited, respectively. The complete information of 4763 subjects has
   been provided after linking the questionnaires from both phases.
   CONCLUSIONS: SEPAHAN project is a novel study that provides the
   opportunity of investigating epidemiological aspects of FGIDs and their
   relationship with different lifestyle and psychological factors.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual traits are especially sensitive to low food resources. Other
   environmental parameters (e.g., predation) should also affect sexual
   trait expression by favoring investment in viability traits rather than
   sexual traits. We know surprisingly little about how predators alter
   investment in sexual traits, or how predator and resource environments
   interact to affect sexual trait investment. We explored how increasing
   phosphorous (P) availability, at a level mimicking cultural
   eutrophication, affects the development of sexual, nonsexual, and
   viability traits of amphipods in the presence and absence of predators.
   Sexual traits and growth were hypersensitive to low P compared to
   nonsexual traits. However, a key sexual trait responded to low P only
   when predator cues were absent. Furthermore, investment trade-offs
   between sexual traits and growth only occurred when P was low. The
   phenotypic changes caused by predator cues and increased P availability
   resulted in higher male mating success. Thus, eutrophication not only
   affects sexual trait expression but also masks the trade-off between
   traits with similar P demand. Sensitivity of sexually selected traits to
   changes in P, combined with the important roles these traits play in
   determining fitness and driving speciation, suggests that human-induced
   environmental change can greatly alter the evolutionary trajectories of

Abstract = {{Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a
   ``shyness-boldness{''} continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take
   risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known
   about how this personality trait might influence individual predation
   risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk
   management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by
   observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals.
   These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect
   to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed
   effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS
   had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately
   repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for
   a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant
   correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior.
   Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of
   the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity,
   suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute
   a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation
   dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability
   in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that
   determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these
   baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility
   when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context,
   potentially removing these differences.}},

Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. In structured populations, phenotypic change can result from changes
   throughout an individuals lifetime (phenotypic plasticity, age-related
   changes), selection and changes in population composition (environment-
   or density-driven fluctuations in age-structure).
   2. The contribution of population dynamics to phenotypic change has
   often been ignored. However, for understanding trait dynamics, it is
   important to identify both the individual- and population-level
   mechanisms responsible for trait change, because they potentially
   reinforce or counteract each other.
   3. We use 22 years of field data to investigate the dynamics of a
   sexually selected phenological trait, the timing of nuptial moult in
   superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus.
   4. We show that trait expression is both climate-and age-dependent, but
   that phenotypic plasticity in response to climate variability also
   varies with age. Old males can acquire nuptial plumage very early after
   high rainfall, but 1- to 2-year-olds cannot. However, males of all ages
   that defer moult to later in the year acquire nuptial plumage earlier
   when conditions are warmer.
   5. The underlying mechanism appears to be that old males may risk
   moulting in the most challenging period of the year: in autumn, when
   drought restricts food abundance and during the cold winter. By
   contrast, young males always moult during the spring transition to
   benign - warmer and generally wetter - conditions. Temperature changes
   dominate this transition that heralds the breeding season, thereby
   causing both young and late-moulting older birds to be temperature
   sensitive.
   6. Climate and age also affect trait dynamics via a population dynamical
   pathway. The same high rainfall that triggers early moulting in old
   males concurrently increases offspring recruitment and thereby reduces
   the average age of males in the population. Consequently, effects of
   rainfall on trait dynamics through phenotypic plasticity of old males
   are dampened by synchronous rejuvenation of the age-structure.
   7. A long-term trend towards drier environments prompted phenotypic
   change because of plasticity, but this was masked by climate-driven
   demographic change (causing apparent stasis). This suggests a novel
   explanation for why trait change may fail to reflect the observed
   pattern of directional selection or phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the spread of human-impacted wildlife habitats, few studies have
   examined how animals adapt their socioecology in agriculturaleforest
   ecotones. Anthropogenic processes such as agricultural development
   directly affect the ecological challenges that species face. In
   agriculturaleforest ecotones cultivated foods that are palatable,
   energy-rich, easily digestible, and that often occur as large, clumped
   and spatially abundant orchards or fields may offer foraging advantages
   over natural foods. However, crop raiding can be risky: harassment,
   injury or even death may arise from confrontations with people. The
   factors that affect grouping decisions and activity budgets within
   anthropogenic environments are unknown. Twelve months of focal data were
   collected from direct observations of one chimpanzee community
   inhabiting a forestefarm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea. Wild fruit abundance
   did not directly influence daily party size. Instead, cultivated
   resource consumption, in combination with other social factors, provided
   chimpanzees with an alternative to fissioning. Chimpanzee party size did
   not differ between crop raids and wild feeds, but party cohesiveness did
   increase during raids. Furthermore, males and females adapted their
   activity budgets in different ways to integrate cultivated resources
   into their broader ecological strategy. As species are increasingly
   forced into anthropogenically impacted habitats, models of
   fissionefusion dynamics and other socioecological adaptations need to
   take into account exploitation of cultivated, energy-rich crops. (C)

Abstract = {{Voluntary wheel running (WR) is a form of physical activity in rodents

   anorexic behavior triggered by the simultaneous introduction of a novel
   diet and WR. This study examined the sequential, compared with the
   simultaneous, introduction of a novel high-fat (HF) diet and voluntary
   WR in rats of three different ages and revealed a surprising finding;
   the simultaneous introduction of HF food and voluntary WR induced a
   behavior in which the animals chose not to eat although food was
   available at all times. This phenomenon was apparently not due to an
   aversion to the novel HF diet because introduction of the running wheels
   plus the HF diet, while continuing the availability of the normal chow
   diet did not prevent the anorexia. Moreover, the anorexia was prevented
   with prior exposure to the HF diet. In addition, the anorexia was not
   related to extent of WR but dependent on the act of WR. The introduction
   a HF diet and locked running wheels did not induce the anorexia. This
   voluntary anorexia was accompanied by substantial weight loss, and the
   anorexia was rapidly reversed by removal of the running wheels.
   Moreover, the HF/WR-induced anorexia is preserved across the age span
   despite the intrinsic decrease in WR activity and increased consumption
   of HF food with advancing age. The described phenomenon provides a new
   model to investigate anorexia behavior in rodents. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Models explaining behavioural syndromes often focus on state-dependency,

   shown as repeatable foraging behaviour across risk. Pike swimming
   activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful
   prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact

   considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary
   predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat
   avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural
   syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour
   between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation.

Abstract = {{The currently rising sea temperatures are expected to affect the
   structure of aquatic communities. Through increased metabolic rates,
   activity and feeding motivation, higher temperature can be expected to
   add to competition and predation risk for many small fish and juveniles.
   However, behavioural flexibility e.g. individual variation in the
   expression of behavioural traits may act to buffer the detrimental
   effects of increased temperature. In the present study we ask how
   juvenile Atlantic cod respond to food availability and predation risk at
   the limits of their current natural temperature at the Icelandic coast
   (3 degrees C-13 degrees C). At 13 degrees C Atlantic cod juveniles
   responded less to risk, remaining active, dispersed and leaving shelter
   positions earlier. However, at the same time their feeding attempts
   reduce significantly and correspondingly to the lower temperature.
   Therefore, our results suggest that at 13 degrees C Atlantic cod
   juveniles do not adjust their behaviour to manage the increased feeding
   motivation while under risk. However, we do find evidence for individual
   variation in how behaviour is expressed across treatments indicating
   natural variation that could respond to selection. In conclusion, our
   results suggest that increased sea temperature could have both immediate
   negative effects on survival and initiate a selective response in
   Atlantic cod populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{286}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{93-101}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Compensatory growth, or catch-up growth, occurs when an organism grows
   faster than the optimal rate after a period of growth restriction. The
   evolved optimal growth rate maximizes an animal's fitness potential
   while preserving tissue quality. Rapid compensatory growth allows the
   organism to achieve an adult size closer to that of an unrestricted
   conspecific. However, this accelerated growth may come at the cost of
   impaired fitness later in life due to accumulated cellular damage.
   Amphibians are an interesting, yet neglected, group in which to observe
   the effects of compensatory growth because of their flexible life
   history and the importance of large size for reproductive fitness. We
   investigated the effects of early nutritional restriction on the growth,
   morphology and three fitness-related behavioural traits of brown tree
   frog tadpoles Litoria ewingii before and after metamorphosis. Tadpoles
   were fed reduced rations for two weeks, c. 35\% of the control group's
   larval period, before being returned to the diet of the controls. The
   dietary treatment caused a significant difference in pre- and
   post-metamorphic survival between the groups. The tadpoles on the
   restricted diet exhibited faster weight gain upon refeeding and reached
   a final size significantly larger than the control tadpoles. However,
   the larval period of the restricted group was extended by c. 5 days,
   compared with the control group. Early nutritional restriction also
   negatively affected the pre-metamorphic fitness-related behavioural
   trait of swimming speed. The restricted group showed an unexpected
   advantage in both post-metamorphic fitness-related behavioural traits of
   feeding latency and hopping ability. These results contrast with
   previous work on compensatory growth in tadpoles because nutritional
   restriction affected the developmental rate and also resulted in
   over-compensation of growth. Our experiment provides support for the
   prevalence of compensatory growth in diverse taxa and a unique
   observation of the post-metamorphic consequences in amphibians adapted
   to ephemeral environments.}},

Abstract = {{The dual intervention point model states that body mass is controlled by
   upper and lower intervention points, above and below which animals (and
   humans) intervene physiologically to bring their body mass back into the
   acceptable range. It has been further suggested that the lower
   intervention point may be defined by the risk of starvation, while the
   upper intervention point may be defined by the risk of predation. The
   objective of the present study was to test whether the risk of
   starvation determines the lower intervention point and to examine the
   physiological and behavioral mechanisms that underpin the regulation of
   body mass, when the risk of starvation is increased. Sixty-four mice
   were exposed to random days of complete fasting or 50\% food restriction
   and their body mass and fat mass responses were measured. Food intake,
   physical activity and body temperature were measured throughout the
   experiment. In addition, plasma leptin and insulin, triglyceride and
   non-esterified fatty acids, along with hypothalamic neuropeptides gene
   expression in the arcuate nucleus were assessed after 13 and 42 days of
   treatment. We found that C57BL/6J mice increased body mass and fatness
   in response to a short-term (13 days) intermittent fasting, which was
   restored to baseline as the treatment was prolonged. In contrast,
   intermittently 50\% food restricted mice showed no significant changes
   in body mass or fatness. Over the first 13 days of treatment the data
   were consistent with the dual intervention point model as the mice
   showed both increased body mass and adiposity over this period. Over the
   more protracted period of 42 days the effect waned and was therefore
   inconsistent with the model. The body mass and fat mass gains in
   intermittently fasted mice were mainly accounted for by increased food
   intake. Elevated NPY gene expression after 13 days (three 24 h fasting
   events) may have driven the increase in food intake. However, no changes
   were observed in such neuropeptides as POMC, CART, AgRP, Ob-Rb and SOCS
   3 or circulating levels of leptin, insulin. NEFA and TG. Hypothermia
   during fasting days may have also contributed to the increase in body
   mass. Over 42 days of treatment (nine 24 h fasting events) cumulative
   food intake was not affected by intermittent starvation. However
   physical activity, mainly activity during the light phase was lowered
   suggesting an adaptation to unpredictable starvation. Overall, mice
   exhibited different behavioral and physiological responses to
   intermittent starvation depending on the duration of treatment. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have shown efficacy in the treatment
   of bipolar disorder, however their specific role in treating the illness
   is unclear. Serum PUFA and dietary intakes of PUFA associate with
   suicidal behavior in epidemiological studies. The objective of this
   study was to assess serum n-3 and n-6 PUFA levels in bipolar subjects
   and determine possible associations with suicidal risk, including
   suicidal history and relevant personality factors that have been
   associated with suicidality. We studied 27 bipolar subjects using the
   NEO-PI to assess the big five personality factors, structured interviews
   to verify diagnosis and assess suicidal history, and lipomics to
   quantify n-3 and n-6 PUFA in serum. We found positive associations
   between personality factors and ratios of n-3 PUFA, suggesting that
   conversion of short chain to long chain n-3s and the activity of enzymes
   in this pathway may associate with measures of personality. Thus, ratios
   of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and the
   activity of fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) involved in the conversion
   of ALA to DHA were positively associated with openness factor scores.
   Ratios of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to ALA and ratios of EPA to DHA
   were positively associated with agreeableness factor scores. Finally,
   serum concentrations of the n-6, arachidonic acid (AA), were
   significantly lower in subjects with a history of suicide attempt
   compared to non-attempters. The data suggest that specific lipid
   profiles, which are controlled by an interaction between diet and
   genetics, correlate with suicidal history and personality factors
   related to suicidal risk. This study provides preliminary data for
   future studies to determine whether manipulation of PUFA profiles
   (through diet or supplementation) can affect personality measures and
   disease outcome in bipolar subjects and supports the need for further
   investigations into individualized specific modulations of lipid
   profiles to add adjunctive value to treatment paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The BeWEL study is aimed at assessing the impact of a
   personalised lifestyle programme on body weight in people at risk of
   developing colorectal adenomas. The study is a two-arm multicentre
   randomised controlled trial comparing the BeWEL lifestyle programme
   against usual care. Over 12 months, 316 people who have had a colorectal
   adenoma removed through the national screening programme will be
   randomised to provide 80\% power to detect a weight loss (primary
   outcome) of 7\% over 12 months.
   Methods: The 12-month intervention will be delivered by lifestyle
   counsellors via three face-to-face visits followed by nine monthly
   telephone support calls. Consultant endorsement for the study will be
   stressed. An individualised caloric prescription based on estimates for
   weight maintenance -600 kcal will be calculated. Motivational
   interviewing techniques will be used to identify personal motivations
   for weight change and ways to improve perceived self-efficacy. The
   programme will utilise personalised diet and physical activity data from
   baseline measures to set behavioural goals. A range of behavioural
   strategies will be employed to support lifestyle change including goal
   setting, identifying specific implementation intentions, self-monitoring
   and feedback. Emphasis will be placed on self-monitoring body weight,
   and weighing scales will be provided. Programme acceptability will be
   explored postintervention with indepth interviews. Compliance and impact
   will be assessed by baseline and follow-up measures of diet by
   self-report, activity by accelerometry and anthropometry.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained from the
   Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics. Dissemination of results
   will focus on publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at
   national/international cancer meetings and NHS groups. In addition, the

Abstract = {{Genetic variation for plastic phenotypes potentially contributes
   phenotypic variation to populations that can be selected during

   variation across the full range of ecologically relevant copper
   concentrations, from starvation to toxicity, and 2) to test the
   hypothesis that plastic networks exhibit increased population variation
   for gene expression. We find that although the vast majority of the
   variation is small in magnitude (considerably <2-fold), not just some,
   but most genes demonstrate variable expression across environments,
   across genetic backgrounds, or both. Plastically expressed genes
   included both genes regulated directly by copper-binding transcription
   factors Mac1 and Ace1 and genes indirectly responding to the downstream
   metabolic consequences of the copper gradient, particularly genes
   involved in copper, iron, and sulfur homeostasis. Copper-regulated gene
   networks exhibited more similar behavior within the population in

   Nevertheless, expression variation in genes like Cup1, important to
   surviving copper stress, was linked with variation in mitotic fitness
   and in the breadth of differential expression across the genome. By
   revealing a broader and deeper range of population variation, our
   results provide further evidence for the interconnectedness of

Abstract = {{Survival strategies and cost-benefit-balances of the predatory insect
   larva (Euroleon nostras FOURCROY, Myrmeleontidae)
   We are investigating the behavior strategies and the evolutionary
   adaptations and we are also determining the quantitative parameters for
   cost-benefit-balance in the antlions Euroleon nostras, Myrmeleon
   formicarius and M bore. Antlions live in sand mostly in deserts and
   semideserts or in zones of glacial origin and in coastal dunes. The
   probability of prey capture is increased to about 200 species as they
   construct pit. However: larvae that construct traps remain essentially
   inactive at the ambush-site and wait for active prey.
   Larvae of E. nostras need a very short time (approximately 25 min) for
   constructing a pitfall trap in relation to the time at resting metabolic
   rate. Therefore, the costs of the pit construction (volume, mass weight,
   energy) are of minor importance in relation to prey. The linear
   accession of pit traps diameter (benefit of prey catch) exponentially
   corresponds to ascent of costs. Although ants live in aggregations and
   use paths, the capture rate of an antlion remains very low, because prey
   is arriving seldom and in unpredictable intervals. In one of the survey
   habitats with 48 pits the antlions captured only 17 prey in 4 days. Each
   pit results in a capture rate of 1 prey/11.3 d. Capturing rates of 1
   prey/3.3 d and 1 prey/24.0 d respectively were reported for 2 other
   areas at the same time.
   The body masses of the first, second and third larval stages varied from
   39 to 50\% of the means (2.71 +/- 1.22 mg, n = 34; 15.20 +/- 7.57 mg, n
   = 34; 57.9 +/- 22.22 mg, n = 29). For all the larvae instars the mean
   extraction rate of living mass of an ant was 55 to 70\% of the live
   weight. The surviving of hunger periods up to more then 4 months of the
   first and second larval instars and up to 8 months in case of the third
   instar is part of evolution-conditioned adjustments. An antlion pit is
   built within 25 min activity time. The function time of the pit was
   about 23:35 h within a 24 h-day before beginning of a pit enlargement
   activity phase.
   The pit construction requires minimum energetic costs, whereas the gain
   obtained by capturing a prey amounts to 20500 mJ per single prey. The
   calculation is based on the energy content of investigated food and the
   carbon content of the prey Formica spec. Our results indicate that an
   antlion with a wet weight (ww) of 22.6 mg releases 0.62 mu g C{*}h(-1)

Abstract = {{Overweight sedentary individuals are at increased risk for
   cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some neurological disorders.
   Beneficial effects of dietary energy restriction (DER) and exercise on
   brain structural plasticity and behaviors have been demonstrated in
   animal models of aging and acute (stroke and trauma) and chronic
   (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) neurological disorders. The
   findings described later, and evolutionary considerations, suggest
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in the
   integration and optimization of behavioral and metabolic responses to
   environments with limited energy resources and intense competition. In
   particular, BDNF signaling mediates adaptive responses of the central,
   autonomic, and peripheral nervous systems from exercise and DER. In the
   hypothalamus, BDNF inhibits food intake and increases energy
   expenditure. By promoting synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the
   hippocampus, BDNF mediates exercise-and DER-induced improvements in
   cognitive function and neuroprotection. DER improves cardiovascular
   stress adaptation by a mechanism involving enhancement of brainstem
   cholinergic activity. Collectively, findings reviewed in this paper
   provide a rationale for targeting BDNF signaling for novel therapeutic
   interventions in a range of metabolic and neurological disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Social experiences can have a persistent effect on biological processes
   leading to phenotypic diversity. Variation in gene regulation has
   emerged as a mechanism through which the interplay between DNA and
   environments leads to the biological encoding of these experiences.
   Epigenetic modifications-molecular pathways through which transcription
   is altered without altering the underlying DNA sequence-play a critical
   role in the normal process of development and are being increasingly
   explored as a mechanism linking environmental experiences to long-term
   biobehavioral outcomes. In this review, evidence implicating epigenetic
   factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, in the link
   between social experiences occurring during the postnatal period and in
   adulthood and altered neuroendocrine and behavioral outcomes will be
   highlighted. In addition, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping
   variation in social behavior and the implications of epigenetics for our
   understanding of the transmission of traits across generations will be
   discussed. (C) 2012, Elsevier Inc.
   Though our DNA sequence provides a template for generating individual
   differences and for the transmission of those characteristics across
   generations, it is evident that the environment contributes
   significantly to both of these processes. The dichotomy between the
   influences of nature (DNA) and nurture (environment) has become part of
   our theoretical framework for understanding the origins of our unique
   characteristics-ranging from personality to disease risk. However,
   advances in molecular biology have provided enlightenment regarding both
   the relationship between genotype and phenotype and the mechanisms
   through which environment shapes biological processes, and the insights
   gained from these advances has challenged the nature versus nurture
   dichotomy. It is becoming increasingly apparent that development is a
   process of dynamic interplay between the genome and our environmental
   experiences. This interplay is perhaps best illustrated in the concept
   of epigenetics-the study of those factors which alter the activity of
   genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. There is increasing
   evidence that environmental experiences can come to shape the activity
   of genes through epigenetic pathways and thus the genotype to phenotype
   and environment to phenotype relationships may ultimately be governed by
   similar molecular processes.
   The investigation of environmentally induced epigenetic effects has
   highlighted the impact of a wide variety of environmental exposures,
   including nutritional levels during development, toxins, and both early
   and later life stressors (Champagne, 2010; Jirtle and Skinner, 2007).
   However, it is perhaps the interplay between social experiences and the
   genome which demonstrates most profoundly how nature and nurture
   interact. Across a variety of species, there is evidence for the effect
   of social experiences occurring across the lifespan on epigenetic
   pathways leading to broad phenotypic effects, including stress
   responsivity, learning/memory, and reproductive behavior (Champagne,
   2010). Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms may account for the emergence of
   social experiences through the effects of these molecular modifications
   on social behavior (Auger et al., 2011; Kataoka et al., 2011).
   Ultimately, these interactive effects can lead to the transgenerational
   continuity of individual differences in neurobiological and behavioral
   characteristics (Champagne, 2008). In this chapter, evidence for the
   epigenetic consequence of social experiences, such as mother-infant
   interactions and adult social interactions, will be highlighted followed
   by a discussion of the epigenetic basis of variation in social behavior.
   This research contributes to our understanding of the inheritance of
   behavior and raises challenging questions regarding future directions in
   the study of behavioral epigenetics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Improvements in diet can decrease the cancer rates. The aim
   of the present study was to determine the relationships between
   self-perception of diet quality and personality, impulsiveness, stress,

   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a
   multiple-stratified random sampling method based on the Korea Census of
   2007. In October 2009, investigators conducted 15-minute face-to-face
   interviews with 1,530 South Korean volunteers who ranged from 30 to 69
   years of age without a history of cancer. Results: Respondents were more
   likely to perceive that they consumed a healthy diet if they were older

   than \$4,000 USD, had a low perceived risk of cancer, consumed less
   alcohol, exercised regularly, had a less agreeable or conscientious
   personality, had low stress levels, had a high sense of coherence or
   self-efficacy, and had ample social support. Conclusion: Psychosocial
   factors, such as personality, stress, sense of coherence, self-efficacy,

Abstract = {{Defining the ecological impacts conferred by invasive fishes provides a
   framework for evaluating the feasibility of control efforts in invaded
   waterways, and for predicting the consequences of future incursions.
   Eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) is a remarkably successful invader
   of freshwater systems worldwide, with the capacity to detrimentally
   impact native fishes both directly (e.g. competition, predation,
   agonistic interactions) and indirectly (e.g. triggering trophic
   cascades). Here, we modelled the influence of eastern gambusia and
   several environmental covariates on fish species diversity, abundance
   and condition based on quantitative survey data collected from 93
   wetlands in south-eastern Australia. We predicted that small-bodied,
   wetland specialist species sharing dietary-and habitat-niches with
   eastern gambusia would be most severely impacted, and that environmental
   stressors associated with wetland drying during late summer would
   magnify these impacts. Eastern gambusia influenced the occurrence,
   abundance and/or body condition of most common wetland species; however,
   the direction and level of impact appeared dependent on both biotic and
   environmental forces. From these results, we postulate that generalist
   life-history strategies that permit niche-segregation may release some
   native species from competitive/predatory pressures, allowing
   coexistence with eastern gambusia in resource-limited, environmentally
   harsh habitats, whilst specialist species that occupy narrower
   ecological niches may be less resistant.}},

Abstract = {{In south east England climate change is predicted to include decreases
   in periodicity of rainfall events during summer, resulting in more,
   longer periods of drought. In many temperate regions these changes will
   affect foraging strategies of soil animals, including arthropod
   macro-decomposers such as terrestrial isopods. We investigated activity
   budgets under drier (50\%) and moisture (90\%) relative humidity
   conditions, for three species: Porcellio scaber, Oniscus asellus and
   Armadillidium vulgare, representing three families, which have different
   morphological adaptations to the terrestrial environment. In the drier
   environment all three species spent more time sheltering, less time
   feeding and less time in other activities. Costs of foraging were
   estimated by monitoring loss of body mass for 7 h. This loss was twice
   as high under the lower humidity regime. On the basis of morphological
   traits, two members of the Oniscidae: O. asellus and Philoscia muscorum,
   differing in eco-morphological strategies, were predicted to be more
   susceptible to desiccation than members of the Porcellionidae or
   Amadillidiidae. Members of the Oniscidae lost mass most quickly and also
   suffered higher mortality in the drier atmosphere. A cost of spending
   more time sheltering was that consumption of high quality food by
   Porcellio scaber was significantly reduced in the drier environment. The
   trade-off between energy gain by feeding and increased probability of
   survivorship by sheltering, is illustrated using an isopleth model.
   Changes in the extent to which the soil fauna will stimulate microbial

Abstract = {{Oviposition behaviour is recognized as an ecologically significant trait
   in insects. Since herbivorous insect females have a potential to lay
   eggs on unsuitable host species, it is hypothesized that this behaviour
   may be the first step in host-range expansion. The most intriguing
   phenomenon, found in some insect species, is the ability of females to
   lay eggs on unsuitable places if hosts are unavailable; this behaviour
   is termed `egg-dumping: Egg-dumping can be adaptive plastic response in
   environments where hosts, either preferred or less suitable, may
   eventually become available. Transgenerational effects of this behaviour
   presume changes in larval feeding experience on different host species.
   Also, diverse larval experience may induce alterations in oviposition
   behaviour. To test whether egg laying behaviour of adult females can be
   modified by larval experience, we performed the experiment on two
   laboratory populations of Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say). First
   population (P) is housed in the laboratory on the common bean for 200
   generations, whereas the second population (C) is derived from the first
   but has been raised for 197 generations on chickpea, a novel and less
   suitable host for larval development. In order to analyze differences
   between short-term and long-term effects of larval experience on
   egg-dumping, both populations have been exposed to each host seed for
   one generation. The results of the study show that females from P
   population lay eggs more frequently in the absence of seeds when
   developed on chickpeas, compared with P females reared on beans. By
   contrast to P females, in C population, larval experience has no
   significant effects either on the number of dumped eggs or on the
   frequency of dumper females. These results demonstrate a significant
   inter-population diversification of phenotypic plasticity in egg-dumping
   behaviour depending on larval host experience. In other words,
   modification of oviposition behaviour, as a consequence of a long-term
   larval nutritional stress, can evoke previously unrecognized
   transgenerational effects.}},

Abstract = {{Seabirds are central place foragers during the breeding season and, as
   marine food resources are often patchily distributed, flexibility in
   foraging behaviour may be important in maintaining prey delivery rates
   to chicks. We developed a methodological approach using a combination of
   GPS data loggers and temperature-depth recorders that allowed us to
   describe the behaviour of surface-feeding seabirds. Specifically, we
   tested whether differences in foraging behaviour of black-legged
   kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla could be linked with reproductive success by
   comparing 2 consecutive years at 2 sites. At Rathlin Island (Northern
   Ireland) during 2010, foraging differed markedly from that during 2009
   and from that at Lambay Island (Republic of Ireland) during both years.
   Birds exhibited foraging trips of greater duration, travelled a greater
   total distance, spent more time in transit and spent longer recuperating
   on the surface of the water. This notable shift was associated with a
   decline in breeding success, with greater loss of eggs to predation and
   lower prey delivery rates, resulting in the starvation of 15\% of
   chicks. We suggest that food resources were reduced or geographically
   less accessible during 2010, with suitable foraging areas located
   further from the colony. Birds did not invest greater amounts of time
   attempting to catch prey. Thus, our results indicate that kittiwakes at
   Rathlin modulated their foraging behaviour not by increasing foraging
   effort through feeding more intensively within prey patches but by
   extending their range to increase the probability of encountering more
   profitable prey patches.}},

   evaluate the effects of physical training during pregnancy on body
   weight gain, waist circumference, glycaemia and cholesterolemia in adult

   3), undernourished (U, n = 3) undernourished and trained (T+U, n = 3).
   During gestation and lactation, U and T+U groups were fed a low protein
   diet (8\% casein) and C and T groups fed a normal protein diet (17\%
   casein). The protocol of moderate physical training was performed on a
   treadmill (5 days/week, 60 min/day, at 65\% of VO2max) and began 4 weeks
   before pregnancy. At pregnancy, the duration and intensity of training
   were reduced (5 days/week, 20 min/day, at 30\% VO2max) until the 19th

   Abdominal circumference (AC) was evaluated in relation to body weight.
   Enzymatic colorimetric method glucose-oxidase/peroxidase and

Abstract = {{Stone martens (Martes foina) are documented as generalist throughout

   availability. We tested if this occurs and what feeding strategies it
   follows in a typical Mediterranean ecosystem in Central Greece by
   analysing contents from 106 stomachs, seasonally collected from three
   different habitats during 2003-2006. Seasonal variation in diet and
   feeding strategies was evident and linked to seasonal nutritional
   requirements, but possibly imposed by strong interference competition
   and intraguild predation. Fleshy fruits and arthropods predominated in
   the diet, but also mammals and birds were frequently consumed. An
   overall low dietary niche breadth (B-A = 0.128) indicated a fruit
   specialization tendency. A generalised diet occurred in spring with high
   individual specialisation, whereas more animal-type prey was consumed
   than fruits. A population specialization towards fruits was indicated
   during summer and autumn, whereas insects were consumed occasionally by
   males. In those seasons it switched to more clumped food types such as
   fruits and insects. In winter it selectively exploited both adult and
   larvae insects and partially fruits overwinter on plants. The tendency
   to consume particular prey items seasonally reflected both the

Abstract = {{Context. Anthropogenic disturbances induce physiological and behavioural

   Aims. The present study aims to compare physiological stress measures

   Methods. We assessed physiological measures that can serve as indicators
   of `stress' to determine whether a highway that bisects our study site
   had physiological effects on adult male Florida scrub-jays. We captured
   male breeders from three territory types, including scrub habitat that
   (1) bordered a highway with a grassy shoulder that created an `edge'
   habitat (roadside), (2) bordered human-maintained habitat (a plowed
   firebreak of sand with adjacent pasture) that served as a control for
   the edge-effect of the road (pasture) and (3) contained only natural
   scrub habitat (interior). We measured baseline concentrations of the
   stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), body mass, and a suite of
   longitudinal body measures to generate a body condition index in males
   from each territory type over three breeding seasons.
   Key results. Roadside jays had greater body mass than did interior and
   pasture jays, although there were no differences in overall baseline
   CORT concentrations or body condition among territory classes. There was
   no difference in clutch initiation date or size and nestling and
   independent-young survival.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that the road through our study site
   has physiological effects on Florida scrub-jays; however, there is mixed
   evidence as to whether it acts as a chronic stressor.
   Implications. Our findings provide evidence that roads and
   road-associated disturbance has neutral or potentially beneficial
   physiological effects of roads on Florida scrub-jays. Knowledge of these
   effects of roads and disturbance on jays will hopefully provide
   additional opportunities to improve conservation of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The trade-off between predation risk and the need to feed is one of the
   major constraints animals have to cope with. Virtually all animals have
   a higher risk of being preyed upon when being active (e.g., searching
   for food or mating partners), compared with being inactive (e.g.,
   staying at their burrows, nests, etc.). Yet, staying safe leads to a
   higher risk of starvation and may reduce reproductive success and body
   growth. Hence selection on behaviour optimizing the search, handling and
   digestion of food while avoiding the risk of predation is strong and
   should lead to strategies maximising survival chances and inclusive
   fitness. These facts call for integrative studies manipulating both,
   abundance of food and predation risk in a factorial set up, analysing
   the effects of both factors on behaviour and physiological parameters.
   We present results of a 2 x 2 factorial experiment, manipulating risk of
   predation and food abundance in guppies. We found that the two factors
   have an additive effect on body growth, but that predation risk by a
   pike cichlid is the main factor affecting the expression of behavioural
   strategies in guppies. Low food availability and high predation risk led
   to lower body growth. High predation risk affected swimming depth and
   risk sensitivity of guppies and might represent adaptive behavioural
   changes to the environmental context experienced in early life. Our
   study shows that integrative studies, analysing multiple interdependent
   and interconnected factors in the wild and in the lab are needed to
   further understand animal behaviour and development.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication-induced changes to benthic faunal activities are problems
   of significant ecological impact, affecting global nutrient budgets as
   well as local trophic connections. We address the question of how
   nitrogen loads to estuarine embayments alter the bioturbation activities
   of benthic fauna. Specifically, we related local benthic activities to
   calculated local nitrogen concentrations for 22 northeastern US
   estuaries. These local nitrogen concentrations were derived from the
   calculated nitrogen loading for the embayment together with the spatial
   distribution of the local flushing time. Our results showed a maximum
   bioturbation rate at intermediate nitrogen concentrations or a
   ``hump-shaped{''} pattern of response. This behavior was evident in all
   embayments that had a range of concentrations including low,
   intermediate, and high values. Embayments where sampling did not include
   this full range did not show this behavior. This work provides methods
   and guidance to help managers make decisions concerning the effects of
   nitrogen loading on the activities and wellbeing of benthic fauna in
   coastal embayments. The novelty of this approach lies in identifying the
   response of bioturbation to nitrogen loading in many systems, without
   costly and time-consuming speciation of benthic fauna, and also in
   rapidly identifying embayments and aquatic areas with vulnerable fauna.
   These results are ecologically significant in supporting the hypothesis
   that benthic organism abundance and activity will peak at mid-levels of
   nitrogen due to the interplay of food availability and oxygen levels,
   noting that the critical levels of these factors differ among water
   bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding effects of urbanization on biodiversity requires
   integrated assessments of demographic and behavioral responses by

   risk. We examined spatial heterogeneity in real and perceived risk
   across an urbanization gradient by comparing survival rates, causes of
   mortality, and antipredator behavior of adult woodchucks (Marmota monax
   (L., 1758)) within an agricultural landscape in Illinois from 2007 to
   2009. Survival rates were higher, and effects of urbanization were
   stronger, during the inactive season. Rural woodchucks primarily died
   from predation or costs associated with hibernation, whereas urban
   woodchucks mainly died from vehicle collisions or unknown reasons. Mean
   levels of antipredator behavior were unrelated to urbanization, but
   among-individual variation in vigilance levels increased in urban areas,
   which may reflect increased spatial variation in disturbance levels
   within urban environments. Distances from burrows while foraging and
   flight initiation distances also were unrelated to urbanization,
   suggesting that urban woodchucks were not strongly habituated to humans.
   Our research provides insights into demographic and behavioral responses

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Many prey organisms exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in
   life-history traits that facilitate a better chance of survival in the
   presence of predators. The evolution of such plastic traits requires
   that the defensive phenotype incurs a cost in the absence of predation.
   2. Model systems that are used to examine predator-induced defences are
   often organisms with complex life histories that only induce defences
   during the larval stage. While many studies have detected costs of
   inducible defences during the larval stage, detecting the costs of
   larval defences after metamorphosis is also important.
   3. We examine the benefits and costs of inducible larval defences in the
   urban mosquito, Aedes notoscriptus, by rearing them in the presence and
   absence of predation cues. We compared survival of larvae inducing
   behavioural defences, when exposed to predation cues, in predation
   trials with predatory fish Hypseleotris galii to that of larvae reared
   in the absence predation cues. We also compared life-history traits of
   predator-exposed larvae to larvae reared in control conditions.
   4. Larvae exposed to chemical predation cues limited activity and were
   able to avoid predation for longer in trials with H. galii. However,
   predator-exposed larvae suffered retarded larval growth and development,
   were smaller at metamorphosis and less resistant to starvation as
   adults.
   5. While it is difficult to understand the `fitness costs' that poorer
   starvation resistance might confer to adult mosquitoes, it is likely
   that smaller adult size of predator-exposed individuals would reduce
   fitness, particularly for females where body size limits the size of
   blood meal they could take to facilitate egg production. We suggest that
   the demonstrable costs of inducible defences in mosquito larvae make
   this a good system for testing theoretical models for the evolutionary
   maintenance of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aims of this pilot study were to determine the
   feasibility of conducting a large-scale study exploring the extent to
   which self-report psychological and behavioral traits associated with
   eating disorders occur during pregnancy, to test the design, and to
   gather preliminary data on the magnitude of the problem. Although eating
   disorders are estimated to affect 5.9\% of women of childbearing age,
   little is known about pregnancy in women who have an undocumented
   history of disordered eating behavior in the United States.
   Understanding and identifying eating disorders is important because
   optimal maternal nutrition contributes to favorable pregnancy and
   neonatal outcomes.
   Methods: In our study using a retrospective descriptive design, a
   convenience sample of 54 postpartum women aged 19 to 43 years
   voluntarily completed a demographic questionnaire and the Eating
   Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) before discharge from the hospital. Medical
   records were reviewed for documented eating disorders.
   Results: Fifteen women (27.8\%) had scores on the EDI-3 indicating that
   they had psychological and behavioral traits associated with eating
   disorders. One (1.85\%) of the 54 participants' medical records listed a
   history of an eating disorder.
   Discussion: Exploration of self-report symptoms associated with eating
   disorders during pregnancy warrants further investigation. Health
   professionals providing care to pregnant women should assess all clients
   for eating disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period,
   regardless of history. J Midwifery Womens Health 2012; 57: 61-66 (C)

Abstract = {{Female songbirds are attracted to male song, and song may honestly
   signal male quality. Song is a phenotypic expression of a complex
   learned behavior and therefore could be indicative of other cognitive
   abilities. Stressful conditions during early development are known to
   adversely affect the development of the mammalian and avian brain, and
   recent evidence suggests a positive association between song quality and
   learning ability. However, prior studies have not assessed how
   early-life stress affects both general cognitive functioning and song
   learning. We subjected nestling- and juvenile-caught European starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris) to either an ad libitum or food-restricted diet until
   approximately 90 days of age. As adults, birds' cognitive abilities were
   assessed via spatial foraging and social learning tasks, while
   controlling for the effects of neophobia. Song learning was assessed in
   undirected and directed singing contexts. We found that birds fed the ad
   libitum diet had significantly longer song bouts in both singing
   contexts, made fewer errors in the spatial foraging task, but performed
   worse on the social learning task than food-restricted birds. Overall,
   song performance only correlated with performance on the spatial
   foraging task: Males with longer mean song bouts in the directed singing
   context committed fewer errors. These data suggest that the neural
   structures supporting song and spatial abilities are both affected by
   nutritional stress during development. Female starlings are attracted to
   longer song bouts and may thus use song bout length to infer spatial
   learning abilities of potential mates.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies on a range of animals have identified a bias that
   seems to violate basic principles of rational behavior: A preference is
   shown for feeding options that previously provided food when reserves
   were low, even though another option had been found to give the same
   reward with less delay. The bias presents a challenge to normative
   models of decision making (which only take account of expected rewards
   and the state of the animal at the decision time). To understand the
   behavior, we take a broad ecological perspective and consider how
   valuation mechanisms evolve when the best action depends upon the
   environment being faced. We show that in a changing and uncertain
   environment, state-dependent valuation can be favored by natural
   selection: Individuals should allow their hunger to affect learning for
   future decisions. The valuation mechanism that typically evolves
   produces the kind of behavior seen in standard laboratory tests. By
   providing an insight into why learning should be affected by the state
   of an individual, we provide a basis for understanding psychological
   principles in terms of an animal's ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Classical foraging theory considers behavioural modifications in

   well foragers are able to accommodate rapid anthropogenic environmental
   change. We conclude that foraging behaviour is generally able to
   mitigate large changes in the amount and type of prey on offer.
   Predation risk has powerful effects on prey behaviour that can
   profoundly affect the growth of their populations, even if predators do
   not actually kill many prey. Moreover, these effects are passed on to
   other parts of the community. We therefore expect the changing face of

Abstract = {{Obesity and the metabolic syndrome have reached epidemic proportions

Abstract = {{Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia, bulimia
   nervosa belong to the behavioural and psychiatric disorders especially
   common in adolescents during the puberty period. The girls aged 14-18
   years old constitute the risk group for anorexia nervosa with the
   tendency to affect even the younger girls. Eating disorders are
   characterized by body dissatisfaction related to the overvaluation of
   the thin body ideal associated with dysfunctional patterns of cognition
   and weight control behaviours that results in significant medical,
   psychological and social complication. The important factor for
   initiating the onset of eating disorders is dysfunctional family
   background: controlling and with high expectations and demands mother
   and the certain personality traits of the adolescent such as low esteem,
   high ambition, perfectionism, perseverance, determination. The first
   symptoms of anorexia nervosa are often unnoticeable. They began with
   gradual elimination of the chosen food products e.g. sweets, bread, meat
   and introduction of ``healthy{''} or ``fit{''} eating patterns to the
   daily diet routine. During the initial phase of the disease the food
   restriction plays the corroborant role giving the anorectic patient the
   feeling of full control, satisfaction and even sense of the success.
   Patient with bulimia nervosa are often undiagnosed because there is no
   spectacular and evident reduction of the body mass. The half of the
   patients with anorexia demonstrate the suicidal thoughts and suicidal
   attempts. The majority of them shows the self-destructive behaviours.
   The treatment of eating disorders comprise the permanent and complex
   psychiatric therapy including the individual and family psychotherapy
   together with nutritional treatment. There is clear correlation between
   the duration of the disorder and the prognosis. The earlier diagnose is

Abstract = {{Sun protection is recommended for skin cancer prevention, yet little is
   known about the role of sun protection on vitamin D levels. Our aim was
   to investigate the relationship between different types of sun
   protective behaviors and serum 25(OH)D levels in the general US
   population.
   Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 5,920 adults aged
   18-60 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   2003-2006. We analyzed questionnaire responses on sun protective
   behaviors: staying in the shade, wearing long sleeves, wearing a hat,
   using sunscreen and SPF level. Analyses were adjusted for multiple
   confounders of 25(OH)D levels and stratified by race. Our primary
   outcome measures were serum 25(OH)D levels (ng/ml) measured by
   radioimmunoassay and vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25(OH)D levels <
   20 ng/ml.
   Staying in the shade and wearing long sleeves were significantly
   associated with lower 25(OH)D levels. Subjects who reported frequent use
   of shade on a sunny day had -3.5 ng/ml (p (trend) < 0.001) lower 25(OH)D
   levels compared to subjects who reported rare use. Subjects who reported
   frequent use of long sleeves had -2.2 ng/ml (p (trend) = 0.001) lower
   25(OH)D levels. These associations were strongest for whites, and did
   not reach statistical significance among Hispanics or blacks. White
   participants who reported frequently staying in the shade or wearing
   long sleeves had double the odds of vitamin D deficiency compared with
   those who rarely did so. Neither wearing a hat nor using sunscreen was
   associated with low 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D deficiency.
   White individuals who protect themselves from the sun by seeking shade
   or wearing long sleeves may have lower 25(OH)D levels and be at risk for
   vitamin D deficiency. Frequent sunscreen use does not appear to be
   linked to vitamin D deficiency in this population.}},

Abstract = {{SIRT1 is a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that governs a number of genetic
   programs to cope with changes in the nutritional status of cells and
   organisms. Behavioral responses to food abundance are important for the
   survival of higher animals. Here we used mice with increased or
   decreased brain SIRT1 to show that this sirtuin regulates anxiety and
   exploratory drive by activating transcription of the gene encoding the
   monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) to reduce serotonin levels in the brain.
   Indeed, treating animals with MAO-A inhibitors or selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) normalized anxiety differences between
   wild-type and mutant animals. SIRT1 deacetylates the brain-specific
   helix-loop-helix transcription factor NHLH2 on lysine 49 to increase its
   activation of the MAO-A promoter. Both common and rare variations in the
   SIRT1 gene were shown to be associated with risk of anxiety in human
   population samples. Together these data indicate that SIRT1 mediates
   levels of anxiety, and this regulation may be adaptive in a changing
   environment of food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Lactation is the most energetically expensive component of reproduction

   between true costs of reproduction, individual differences or seasonal
   variation. We experimentally manipulated reproduction in free-ranging,
   eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), using a fertility control
   agent. Our novel field experiment revealed that females altered their
   behaviour in direct response to the energetic demands of reproduction:
   reproducing females increased bite rates, and thus food intake, when the
   energetic demands of lactation were highest. Reproducing females did not
   reduce the time spent on vigilance for predators, but increased their
   forage intake on faecal-contaminated pasture, thereby increasing the
   risk of infection by gastrointestinal parasites-a largely unrecognized
   potential cost of reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that small size at birth and during infancy are associated
   with a higher risk of diabetes and related metabolic disease in later
   life has pointed to the importance of developmental factors in these
   conditions. The birth size associations are thought to reflect exposure
   to adverse environmental factors during early development but the
   mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. Animal and human
   work has pointed to the importance of changes in the set-point of a
   number of key hormonal systems controlling growth and development. These
   include the IGF-1/GH axis, gonadal hormones and, in particular, the
   systems mediating the classical stress response. Several studies show
   that small size at birth is linked with increased activity of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathoadrenal system in adult
   life. More recent human studies have shown associations between specific
   adverse experiences during pregnancy, such as famine or the consumption
   of adverse diets, and enhanced stress responses many decades later. The
   mediators of these neuroendocrine responses are biologically potent and
   are likely to have a direct influence on the risk of metabolic disease.
   These neuroendocrine changes may also have an evolutionary basis being
   part of broader process, termed phenotypic plasticity, by which adverse
   environmental cues experienced during development modify the structure
   and physiology of the adult towards a phenotype adapted for adversity.
   The changes are clearly advantageous if they lead to a phenotype which
   is well-adapted for the adult environment, but may lead to disease if
   there is subsequent overnutrition or other unexpected environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Plants have shaped our human life form from the outset. With the
   emerging recognition of world population feeding, global climate change
   and limited energy resources with fossil fuels, the relevance of plant
   biology and biotechnology is becoming dramatically important. One key
   issue is to improve plant productivity and abiotic/biotic stress
   resistance in agriculture due to restricted land area and increasing
   environmental pressures. Another aspect is the development of
   CO2-neutral plant resources for fiber/biomass and biofuels: a transition
   from first generation plants like sugar cane, maize and other important
   nutritional crops to second and third generation energy crops such as
   Miscanthus and trees for lignocellulose and algae for biomass and feed,
   hydrogen and lipid production. At the same time we have to conserve and
   protect natural diversity and species richness as a foundation of our
   life on earth. Here, biodiversity banks are discussed as a foundation of
   current and future plant breeding research. Consequently, it can be
   anticipated that plant biology and ecology will have more indispensable
   future roles in all socio-economic aspects of our life than ever before.
   We therefore need an in-depth understanding of the physiology of single
   plant species for practical applications as well as the translation of
   this knowledge into complex natural as well as anthropogenic ecosystems.
   Latest developments in biological and bioanalytical research will lead
   into a paradigm shift towards trying to understand organisms at a
   systems level and in their ecosystemic context: (i) shotgun and
   next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation,
   (ii) genome-scale molecular analysis using OMICS technologies and (iii)
   computer-assisted analysis, modeling and interpretation of biological
   data. Systems biology combines these molecular data, genetic evolution,
   environmental cues and species interaction with the understanding,
   modeling and prediction of active biochemical networks up to whole
   species populations. This process relies on the development of new
   technologies for the analysis of molecular data, especially genomics,
   metabolomics and proteomics data. The ambitious aim of these
   non-targeted `omic' technologies is to extend our understanding beyond
   the analysis of separated parts of the system, in contrast to
   traditional reductionistic hypothesis-driven approaches. The consequent
   integration of genotyping, pheno/morphotyping and the analysis of the
   molecular phenotype using metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics
   will reveal a novel understanding of plant metabolism and its
   interaction with the environment. The analysis of single model systems -
   plants, fungi, animals and bacteria - will finally emerge in the
   analysis of populations of plants and other organisms and their
   adaptation to the ecological niche. In parallel, this novel
   understanding of ecophysiology will translate into knowledge-based
   approaches in crop plant biotechnology and marker- or genome-assisted
   breeding approaches. In this review the foundations of green systems
   biology are described and applications in ecosystems research are
   presented. Knowledge exchange of ecosystems research and green
   biotechnology merging into green systems biology is anticipated based on
   the principles of natural variation, biodiversity and the
   genotype-phenotype environment relationship as the fundamental drivers
   of ecology and evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is ample evidence to suggest that a significant part of daily
   eating behaviours consists of habits. In line with this, the concept of
   habit is increasingly incorporated into studies investigating the
   behavioural and psychosocial determinants of food choice, yielding
   evidence that habit is one of the most powerful predictors of eating
   behaviour. Research shows that habitual behaviour is fundamentally
   different from non-habitual behaviour: when behaviour is habitual,
   people require little information to make decisions, intentions are poor
   predictors of behaviour, and behaviour is triggered by situational cues.
   These insights have vast implications for research in the food domain
   that are only just beginning to be addressed. Also, theorizing on habits
   has important implications for behaviour change interventions, yet few
   interventions that are based on habit theory have been tested in a food
   context. The present article provides an overview of habit research and
   discusses possibilities to increase our knowledge of the role of habits
   in eating behaviour. It is shown that interventions targeting habitual
   behaviour can try to (i) change the situation that triggers the habitual
   behaviour, (ii) promote or inhibit the habitual response and (iii)
   change relevant contingencies. These insights can act as a starting
   point for future intervention research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Individual Differences Model posits that individual differences in

   boys and girls, age 8-12 years, with wide ranges of dietary restraint,
   adiposity, and stress reactivity were measured for total energy intake
   and choice of energy dense `comfort' and lower density `healthy' foods
   following reading and speech stressor manipulations. When exploring the
   interaction of dietary restraint and stress reactivity, lower
   restraint/lower reactivity and lower restraint/higher reactivity were
   associated with reductions in energy intake (37-62 kcal) and comfort
   food (33-89 kcal). Higher restraint/lower reactivity was associated with
   consuming 86 fewer total kcal and 45 fewer kcal of comfort food. Only
   higher restraint/higher reactivity predicted increased energy intake
   (104 kcal) and comfort food (131 kcal). The interaction of dietary
   restraint and percentage body fat revealed that lower restraint/lower
   adiposity was associated with consuming 123 fewer kcal after being
   stressed with the entire reduction due to a decrease in comfort food.
   Lower restraint/higher adiposity was associated with consuming 116 kcal
   more after being stressed with 70\% (81 kcal) of the increase in the
   form of comfort foods. Higher restraint/lower adiposity and higher
   restraint/higher adiposity were associated with smaller changes in total
   energy intake of 22 kcal and 1 kcal; respectively. Both restraint and
   adiposity moderated the effect of stress on energy intake and food

Abstract = {{Acclimation in the thermal tolerance range of insects occurs when they
   are exposed to novel temperatures in the laboratory. In contrast to the
   large number of studies that have tested for the ability of insects to
   acclimate, relatively few have sought to determine the time-course for
   attainment and reversal of thermal acclimation. In this study the time
   required for the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann,
   and the Natal fruit fly, Ceratitis rosa Karsch, to acclimate to a range
   of constant temperatures was tested by determining the chill-coma
   recovery time and heat knock-down time of flies that had been exposed to
   novel benign temperatures for different durations. The time required for
   reversal of acclimation for both Ceratitis species was also determined
   after flies had been returned to the control temperature. Acclimation to
   31 degrees C for only one day significantly improved the heat knock-down
   time of C capitata, but also led to slower recovery from chill-coma.
   Heat knock-down time indicated that acclimation was achieved after only
   one day in C rosa, but it took three days for C rosa to exhibit a
   significant acclimation response to a novel temperature of 33 degrees C
   when measured using chill-coma recovery time. Reversal of acclimation
   after return to initial temperature conditions was achieved after only
   one day in both C capitata and C. rosa. Adult C capitata held at 31.5
   degrees C initially exhibited improved heat knock-down times but after 9
   days the heat knock-down time of these flies had declined to levels not
   significantly different from that of control flies held at the baseline
   temperature of 24 degrees C. In both Ceratitis species, heat knock-down
   time declined with age whereas chill-coma recovery time increased with
   age, indicating an increased susceptibility to high and low

   then applied to gain insight into anticounterfeit product/package
   efforts. Based on this research, it appears that there is value for
   brand marketers to enhance their anticounterfeit efforts and consumer
   confidence by utilizing warning labels and information labels on their
   labels or packages. Currently, consumer perception of a domestic
   counterfeit product threat (promoted as genuine products), even for
   pharmaceuticals by healthcare professionals, although increasing has
   still been very low. Generally, the consumers believe and expect that
   the product purchased from retailers is safe and genuine. The study
   reviewed many key warning and label communication areas: consumer
   behaviour review, technical specifications, anticounterfeit, tamper
   evidence/tamper resistance, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol, cigarette,
   nutrition food and nutrition supplements. To complete the insight on
   communicating with the consumer, a review of label legibility was

   population was always food limited. In fact, as food supply increased,
   the population increased at an increasing rate and consumed a higher
   percentage of the food supply, apparently because higher food
   concentrations make more stream area energetically profitable for drift
   feeders. The behaviour most responsible for this response was activity
   selection: when food was abundant, fish chose to feed less frequently
   and more nocturnally, thereby reducing predation mortality so more fish
   survived longer. These results indicate that the traditional concept of
   food limitation, that food availability stops limiting population size
   when it exceeds some threshold level, may not be useful and can be
   misleading. Results also strongly contradict the concept that a salmonid
   population is not food limited if the total food supply is greater than
   the population's consumption. Explicit consideration of adaptive
   behaviour produced a novel but believable understanding of food effects
   on salmonid populations. Published 2011. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {{Promiscuous and repeated mountings by females are evolutionarily
   intriguing as females are expected to be choosy and matings are expected
   to be costly. We evaluate the evolutionary basis of these behaviours in
   a high-density population of European badgers. We analysed postpartum
   mounting behaviour, in 3 years, at two neighbouring social groups each
   year. We demonstrate a polygynandrous social mating system, with
   repeated mounting. Mounting was skewed among females in four
   social-group-years, but overall did not differ from random, potentially
   because female reproductive success is context dependent, varying with
   local food availability and female-female competition. Some males
   mounted more than others; however, male mounting frequency was not
   related to dominance rank, self-grooming rate, or body condition index.
   Mounting frequency did not predict paternity success; furthermore, a
   16-year genetic data set showed that paternity success was positively
   correlated with body condition index. Females may therefore mount with
   males that do not father their offspring to minimize the risk of
   infanticide from them. Females may also trade mountings for allogrooming
   from males, but mounting frequency did not vary with relatedness,
   aggression received from males or sequential allomarking by males. We
   conclude that promiscuous and repeated mounting in badgers may have
   evolved to reduce male-male aggression around mounting and the
   likelihood of infanticide from males by masking paternity. Promiscuous
   mounting of female badgers does not devalue the previous male's sperm,
   but may promote sperm competition, genetic diversity and genetic
   compatibility. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Aggressive interactions in animals are often resolved in favour of the
   individual with superior fighting ability, or resource-holding potential
   (RHP). A recent revival of studies of aggressive behaviour has focused
   on the assessment strategies used in animal contests. Strategies of
   dispute resolution through mutual or self-assessment of RHP differ in
   the predicted relationship between interaction duration and each
   competitor's relative and absolute RHP. We studied potential components
   of RHP (mass, length, body condition) and their relationship to contest
   duration and the level of escalation in the grey treefrog, Hyla
   versicolor, using a novel method to stage aggressive interactions in the
   laboratory. Overall, large males were more likely to win than small
   males, but they only had an advantage in less escalated interactions and
   were not more successful in physical fights. There was limited evidence
   for an effect of body size on interaction duration or the level of
   escalation. Specifically, the body condition of both the smaller and
   larger contestant was weakly negatively related to the duration and
   level of escalation of contests. This relationship is the opposite of
   what would be expected under any assessment strategy. Given these data,
   coupled with the lack of relationships between other size measures and
   interaction duration, we conclude that assessment of body size does not
   occur in contests in H. versicolor. Other unmeasured components of RHP
   may play a role in determining interaction duration, and the relatively
   weak and ineffective fighting abilities of this species may limit the
   dominance of larger individuals. Relatively little is known about
   aggressive behaviour in frogs. Our method for staging aggressive
   interactions allows us to address predictions of game theory models in

Abstract = {{Dolphins live in complex social systems with a wide variety of grouping
   and association patterns. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of
   these associations (fission-fusion dynamics) is necessary to investigate
   the underlying factors and mechanisms shaping mammalian social systems

   photoidentification, focal observations, association analyses and social
   network techniques to quantify variation in the grouping patterns and
   fission-fusion dynamics of small, sympatric populations of Australian
   snubfin dolphins, Orcaella heinsohni, and Indo-Pacific humpback
   dolphins, Sousa chinensis, off the northeast coast of Queensland.
   Schools of snubfin dolphins were larger and more stable, irrespective of
   behavioural activity, than those of humpback dolphins. While
   associations of both species showed nonrandom patterns and structure,
   the social network of snubfin dolphins was characterized by numerous
   strong associations, whereas the strength of the humpback dolphin's
   social network did not differ from random. Modelling of temporal
   patterns of association indicated long-lasting associations were an
   important feature of snubfin dolphins' fission-fusion dynamics. In
   contrast, associations among humpback dolphins over time were best
   described by short-term relationships. The contrasting grouping and
   fission-fusion dynamics of snubfin and humpback dolphins appear to be a
   response to different feeding habits and prey availability. Future

Abstract = {{1. Animals can mitigate the consequences of conflicting food-web
   constraints (e.g. resource availability vs. predation risk) through
   plasticity in the expression of functional traits. Because functional
   trait expression in turn determines a species impact on ecosystem
   functions, e.g. its trophic function, there is a growing need to develop
   a predictive theory that links trait plasticity to ecosystem
   functioning. But there is currently an incomplete empirical foundation
   on which to develop such theory.
   2. To address this issue, we explored the link between plasticity in a
   suite of traits (e.g. head morphology, gut size, bite size) that
   determine the trophic function of a generalist grasshopper herbivore
   facing predation risk. We reared grasshoppers in the field under two
   single-forage environments where the plant resources had different
   physical and nutritional properties and in intermediate mixed-forage
   environments with or without risk of spider predation.
   3. We found that in the single-forage environments, grasshoppers became
   more efficient at ingesting the resource they were reared on.
   4. In mixed-resource environments, grasshoppers developed a phenotype
   that was not intermediate to the phenotypes in the two single-forage
   environments, regardless of predation risk.
   5. We propose that the suite of phenotypic changes observed in our study
   represent two alternative feeding strategies that vary with the
   possibility of using behavioural resource selection in different
   environmental contexts.
   6. Our results suggest that plasticity in trophic function may not
   emerge from a direct link between the primary traits that determine
   consumer consumption efficiency given the physical properties of its
   resources (as is customarily presumed) but rather indirectly from
   secondary traits that may remain latent until such time that they are
   drawn into play when the species faces a particular challenge. This
   means that fully understanding how functional traits influence a
   species' role in an ecosystem requires consideration of a broader suite
   of traits than simply those assumed to constrain resource ingestion.}},

Abstract = {{Rational and objectives Neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic peptide that
   is released during periods of food restriction, has been shown to have a
   significant modulatory impact on drug-related behaviors. We have
   previously reported that both acute food deprivation (FD) and NPY
   injections can reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behavior, a proposed
   animal model of relapse to drug abuse. However, it is not clear whether
   the FD effect on drug seeking is dependent on NPY transmission. Here, we
   used the reinstatement model to assess the role of NPY Y1 and
   Y5-receptor-mediated transmission in FD-induced reinstatement of heroin
   seeking.
   Methods Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 10-12 days (0.1
   mg/kg/infusion/intravenous). Animals then underwent extinction training
   followed by drug-seeking reinstatement tests under 21 h of FD and sated
   conditions.
   Results Injections of a novel NPY Y5-receptor antagonist, Lu AA33810
   (0.0, 1.0, or 30.0 mg/kg/IP), resulted in a significant attenuation of
   FD-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking. However, no
   significant effects on reinstatement were found for the Y1-receptor
   antagonist, BIBO 3304 (0.0, 5.0, or 10.0 nmol/intracerebroventricular).
   Conclusions These results suggest that while signals mediated through
   NPY Y1 receptors play a modest role in reinstatement, activation of Y5
   receptors has a critical function in FD-induced reinstatement of
   heroin-seeking behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Capture and temporary confinement of wild birds are integral parts of
   wildlife management practice and research used, for example, during
   translocation or reintroduction initiatives. We report here on the
   behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild
   blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly
   consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the
   relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations.
   Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration,
   integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day
   confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 +/- 66.6 (mean +/- S.E.)
   and 678.2 +/- 115.8 ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of
   corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8
   and 2.2 ng/mL respectively, P < 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week
   period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased
   propensity for locomotory behaviours (P = 0.001), maintenance behaviours
   (P = 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P = 0.04) over the period of
   captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P < 0.001) decreased,
   probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated
   decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual
   behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation
   days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability
   (Repeatability = 0.592 +/- 0.084, P < 0.0001). Significant
   repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations
   measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability = 0.619 +/- 0.166, P =
   0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability = 0.368
   +/- 0.166, P = 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We
   used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of
   locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was
   positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response
   at release (P = 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation
   days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P
   = 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days
   after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the
   behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity,
   may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement
   that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Eating disorders and, in particular, anorexia nervosa (AN) have
   morbidity and mortality rates that are among the highest of any mental
   disorders and are associated with significant functional impairment.
   More than 25 years ago, several researchers hypothesised that the
   prerequisite for the development of AN was a family process
   characterised by an overprotective and conflict-avoiding parent-child
   interaction. Family studies, however, suggest that AN is a complex
   genetic disorder that is likely expressed primarily by temperament and
   specific traits during childhood, including inhibition, perfectionism
   and harm avoidance. Recent studies have described an impaired
   flexibility and deficits in social cognition that are independent of
   body weight and the current state of the eating disorder, providing
   further evidence for a genetic component of AN. The physiological and
   psychological alterations and the increasing societal demands that occur
   during puberty may trigger onset. The starvation process itself is
   associated with severe alterations of central and peripheral metabolism,
   especially neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter changes, which are
   thought to affect the adolescent brain during the vulnerable period of
   neural restructuring. Long-standing malnutrition during adolescence and
   young adulthood associated with hormonal and neuropeptide dysfunctions
   may produce ``biological scars{''} that maintain and accelerate the
   disorder and likely result in chronic mental disorders in adulthood as
   well as poor social functioning.}},

   characteristics of their child. A number of questions about eating

   greater fussiness and lower satiety responsivity on the Child Eating

   alternative gaits by three species of parrotfishes (princess, Scarus
   taeniopterus; queen, Scarus vetula; stoplight, Sparisoma viride)
   escaping an approaching snorkeller in their natural fringing reef
   habitat in Barbados. As body size increased from about 7 to 58 cm, the
   proportion of fish using an energetically more costly but relatively
   faster escape (body and caudal fin swimming) rather than a less costly
   and relatively slower escape (paired fin swimming) decreased from 100\%
   to 0\%. In contrast, the study confirmed previous research showing that
   larger fish fled at greater distances from the snorkellers, behaviour
   which would have increased safety but incurred higher opportunity costs.
   We conclude that small fish require a more expensive gait to attain an
   adequate escape speed. Thus, the gait used for escaping shows a
   compensatory relationship with body size because small individuals with
   lower swimming capacity use a higher proportion of that capacity. On the
   other hand, flight initiation distance shows cospecialization with body
   size because larger fish with higher swimming capacity further reduce
   their risk by fleeing sooner. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Maternal hypoprolactinemia at the end of lactation in rats reduces milk
   production and is associated with offspring's malnutrition. Since
   malnutrition during development is also known to have long lasting
   effects on cognition and emotion, in the present study we tested the
   hypothesis that maternal hypoprolactinemia, induced by bromocriptine
   treatment, at the end of the lactating period affects memory/learning,
   novelty-seeking and anxiety-like behaviors in adult male Wistar rats
   using, respectively, the radial arm water maze (RAWM), the hole board
   (HB) arena and the elevated plus-maze (EPNl). We also analyzed serum
   corticosterone and thyroid hormone levels at postnatal day (PN) 21.
   Lactating dams were treated with bromocriptine (BRO, 1 mg twice a day,
   inhibiting prolactin) or saline from PN19 to 21 (the last 3 days of
   lactation). BRO offspring had hypercorticosteronemia and hypothyroidism
   at PN21. In the RAWM, reductions in latency observed in CON rats were
   initially more accentuated than in BRO ones. By the end of the testing
   period, latencies became similar between groups. No difference was
   observed between groups regarding the number of nose-pokes in the HB. In
   the EPM, BRO rats stayed less time in and had fewer entries into the
   open-arms than CON ones. This pattern of results indicates that maternal
   bromocriptine treatment at the end of the lactating period results in
   poorer memory/learning performance and in higher levels of anxiety-like
   behavior in the adult offspring, demonstrating that even a relatively
   short period of malnutrition during development can have long lasting
   detrimental effects regarding cognition and emotion. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is a significant global health problem, with the
   proportion of women entering pregnancy with a body mass index greater
   than or equal to 25 kg/m(2) approaching 50\%. Obesity during pregnancy
   is associated with a well-recognised increased risk of adverse health
   outcomes both for the woman and her infant, however there is more
   limited information available regarding effective interventions to
   improve health outcomes. The aims of this randomised controlled trial
   are to assess whether the implementation of a package of dietary and
   lifestyle advice to overweight and obese women during pregnancy to limit
   gestational weight gain is effective in improving maternal, fetal and
   infant health outcomes.
   Methods/Design: Design: Multicentred randomised, controlled trial.
   Inclusion Criteria: Women with a singleton, live gestation between
   10(+0)-20(+0) weeks who are obese or overweight (defined as body mass
   index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2), at the first antenatal visit.
   Trial Entry \& Randomisation: Eligible, consenting women will be
   randomised between 10(+0) and 20(+0) weeks gestation using a central
   telephone randomisation service, and randomisation schedule prepared by
   non-clinical research staff with balanced variable blocks.
   Stratification will be according to maternal BMI at trial entry, parity,
   and centre where planned to give birth.
   Treatment Schedules: Women randomised to the Dietary and Lifestyle
   Advice Group will receive a series of inputs from research assistants
   and research dietician to limit gestational weight gain, and will
   include a combination of dietary, exercise and behavioural strategies.
   Women randomised to the Standard Care Group will continue to receive
   their pregnancy care according to local hospital guidelines, which does
   not currently include routine provision of dietary, lifestyle and
   behavioural advice. Outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocated
   treatment group.
   Primary Study Outcome: infant large for gestational age (defined as
   infant birth weight >= 90(th) centile for gestational age).
   Sample Size: 2,180 women to detect a 30\% reduction in large for
   gestational age infants from 14.40\% (p = 0.05, 80\% power, two-tailed).
   Discussion: This is a protocol for a randomised trial. The findings will
   contribute to the development of evidence based clinical practice
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{The geographic range of the Timber Rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus)
   encompasses most of the eastern half of the United States. Although the
   overall diet composition of C. horridus has been well documented and has
   been reported to be very broad, local population variation has not been
   studied. We examined the diet and foraging behavior of C. horridus from
   four separate populations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A total of 253
   prey items from scat samples, stomach samples, and field observation
   were identified to species or family level. Although voles (Myodes
   gapperi) and mice (Peromyscus spp.) comprised the bulk of the diet in
   all populations, relative prey species frequency differed significantly
   among the four populations. These data indicate that the food habits of
   C. horridus varied widely even within relatively small geographic
   distances. Comparisons with small mammal trapping data further suggest
   that the diet composition of this ambush predator may not simply reflect
   the availability of prey species. Radioteiemetric observations of C.
   horridus further indicate differing frequencies of log-oriented foraging
   behavior among the study sites. Analysis of body posture revealed an
   alternative ambush foraging posture (non-log-oriented posture) which
   also exhibited variation in frequency among study sites. However,
   selected foraging habitats at all study sites were typified by a locally
   high density of fallen logs and other woody debris (6\% of forest-floor
   cover/m(2)). These findings indicate geographic variation in the
   foraging ecology of C. horridus and suggest behavioral plasticity in
   foraging response to available prey.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike many species that are `occasional' cannibals, the tadpoles of
   cane toads specifically target conspecific eggs for consumption,
   ignoring the eggs of sympatric frog species (at least within the toads'
   current invasive range in Australia). We tested three hypotheses as to
   the benefits of consuming conspecific eggs: transfer of toxins from eggs
   (which have high toxin content) to tadpoles (which have lower toxin
   content), nutritional input, and reduction of future competition. We
   found no evidence of toxin transfer, but eggs contained sufficient
   nutrition for cannibalistic tadpoles to develop through to
   metamorphosis, and egg consumption enhanced rates of tadpole growth and
   differentiation through reduction of subsequent competition from younger
   tadpoles. Features of the cane toads' life history (e. g. synchronized
   deposition and development of all eggs within a clutch; delay between
   hatching and onset of feeding; short larval stage relative to
   interclutch interval of a given adult female) mean that the cannibals
   are unlikely to be close relatives of the younger conspecifics they
   consume (either as eggs or as metamorphs). Kin selection may thus favour
   rather than oppose cannibalism. The end result is that cannibalistic
   toad tadpoles benefit through nutrition and reduced future competition,
   with little collateral risk of eating their own siblings. Another
   potential cost of cannibalism (risk of disease transmission) may be
   minimal in this system, because the eggs are unlikely to contain
   pathogens (reflecting their brief embryonic periods and protective jelly
   layers). The combination of these forces has favoured the evolution of
   targeted cannibalism by cane toad tadpoles. (C) 2011 The Association for

Abstract = {{Risk-sensitive foraging theory is central to behavioural ecology. It
   relates individual fitness to variance in foraging success (risk) and
   predicts which foraging strategy maximizes fitness under applicable
   constraints. Fitness usually comprises survival and reproduction. Yet,
   most models of risk-sensitive foraging have focused on only one of these
   two factors. Consequently, such models cannot account for the
   interaction between resource availability and population size, i.e.
   density dependence.
   Here, we incorporate both mortality and reproduction as functions of an
   individual's risk-sensitive foraging strategy. In our model the
   individual strategy thus determines the mean availability of resources
   per capita and consequently the equilibrium population size. From a
   continuum of possible strategies we are able to pinpoint the exact
   risk-sensitive strategies that are favoured by natural selection in
   saturated habitats and demonstrate that, in addition to risk proneness
   and risk aversion, a number of optimal intermediate variances can be
   selected for.
   In contrast to predictions based on models that ignore the interaction
   between behaviour, population density and resource availability, our
   results show that high baseline mortality (e.g. predation risk) does not
   necessarily lead to risk proneness. In addition to this novel finding,
   our model confirms the crucial importance of resource-independent
   (baseline) mortality for optimal risk-sensitive behaviour. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{The effect of extended incubation (delayed hatching) on larval
   morphology in the terrestrially spawning common galaxias Galaxias
   maculatus was investigated by inducing larvae to hatch 1 and 2 weeks
   after the normal 2 week incubation period. After 1 week of extended
   incubation, larvae were larger (longer in standard length, L-S, and
   greater in body depth) compared to controls (larvae that experienced
   normal incubation durations). After 2 weeks of extended incubation,
   larvae were smaller (shorter in L-S and smaller in body depth) than
   larvae that experienced 1 week of extended incubation. Furthermore, eye
   area increased while yolk-sac size decreased monotonically with
   increasing incubation duration. These results suggest that larvae
   experiencing long periods of extended incubation are using somatic
   tissue to meet their metabolic demands. Larvae that experienced 2 weeks
   of extended incubation succumbed to starvation sooner than control
   larvae, but hatching success was not significantly different.
   Temperature mediated the effect of extended incubation on the morphology
   of larvae at hatching, most likely, through its effects on developmental
   rate and efficiency of yolk utilization. This study demonstrates some of

Abstract = {{An increasing body of evidence suggests that poor nutrition at the very
   beginning of life even before birth - leads to large and long term
   negative consequences for both mental and physical health. This paper
   reviews the evidence from studies on the Dutch famine, which
   investigated the effects of prenatal undernutrition on later health. The
   effects of famine appeared to depend on its timing during gestation, and
   the organs and tissues undergoing critical periods of development at
   that time. Early gestation appeared to be the most vulnerable period.
   People who were conceived during the famine were at increased risk of
   schizophrenia and depression, they had a more atherogenic plasma lipid
   profile, were more responsive to stress and had a doubled rate of
   coronary heart disease. Also, they performed worse on cognitive tasks
   which may be a sign of accelerated ageing. People exposed during any
   period of gestation had more type 2 diabetes. Future investigation will
   expand on the finding that the effects of prenatal famine exposure may
   reach clown across generations, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms.
   Recent evidence suggests that similar effects of prenatal undernutrition
   are found in Africa, where many are undernourished. Hunger is a major
   problem worldwide with one in seven inhabitants of this planet suffering
   from lack of food. Adequately feeding women before and during pregnancy
   may be a promising strategy in preventing chronic diseases worldwide.

Abstract = {{Socioecological models suggest competition for food, foraging

   model (Isbell in Kinship and behavior in primates. Oxford University,

   reported to maintain patterns of social behavior observed in their wild
   conspecifics despite different food distribution, predation risk, and
   dispersal options. This behavioral similarity suggests squirrel monkeys'
   social behavior has limited flexibility to respond to environmental
   changes. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the flexibility of
   social behavior within a captive group of S. sciureus. First, we
   determined whether dominance and affiliative relationships observed
   under normal laboratory conditions (with abundant, widely distributed,
   food; no dispersal option; and no predators) better matched published
   reports of relationships among wild conspecifics or the predictions of
   the predation/competition model. Second, we made preferred food items
   defensible to determine whether dominance interactions would become more
   frequent and linear, as predicted by the model. The model correctly
   predicted rates of dominance behavior in both conditions and a linear
   hierarchy in the defensible food condition but did not predict the
   consistent affiliative relationships and linear dominance hierarchy
   observed in normal lab conditions. Although hierarchies were linear and
   male dominant, manipulating food distribution changed the dominant
   individual within each sex. Our findings suggest interaction rates adapt
   more rapidly than social structure to environmental changes in Saimiri
   and recommend caution in interpreting tests of socioecological models.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of invasive mammals to adjust their diet in response to new
   or variable resources is often proposed to explain their invasion
   success on islands with differing environmental conditions, especially
   islands with strong spatiotemporal changes in the nature and abundance
   of their resources. In this study, we investigated how habitat
   heterogeneity and seasonal fluctuation in resource quality affect
   dietary breadth and plasticity in an island-invasive rodent, the black
   rat Rattus rattus, on a small Mediterranean island. We tested for
   dietary plasticity of rats at both the individual and population levels
   by using traditional dietary and stable isotope analyses at successively
   increasing time scales, coupled with a long-term study of individual
   rats in three habitats of close proximity. Dietary and movement analyses
   both indicated that R. rattus is able to exploit a wide range of
   resources and habitats. However, dietary plasticity and habitat breadth
   were far narrower at the individual level. Results revealed that rats
   exclusively used resources found in their local habitat, and very few
   individuals moved among adjacent habitats in pursuit of higher-quality
   resources, despite those resources being abundant in their immediate
   environment. This counterintuitive finding suggests that intraspecific
   interactions must restrict rat mobility. Our results suggest that even
   on small islands, accessibility of patchy and high-quality resources to
   individuals from the entire population is not systematic. This result
   has important implications when quantifying invasive rodent impacts on

Abstract = {{Explaining the origins of novel traits is central to evolutionary
   biology. Longstanding theory suggests that developmental plasticity, the
   ability of an individual to modify its development in response to
   environmental conditions, might facilitate the evolution of novel
   traits. Yet whether and how such developmental flexibility promotes
   innovations that persist over evolutionary time remains unclear. Here,
   we examine three distinct ways by which developmental plasticity can
   promote evolutionary innovation. First, we show how the process of
   genetic accommodation provides a feasible and possibly common avenue by
   which environmentally induced phenotypes can become subject to heritable
   modification. Second, we posit that the developmental underpinnings of
   plasticity increase the degrees of freedom by which environmental and
   genetic factors influence ontogeny, thereby diversifying targets for
   evolutionary processes to act on and increasing opportunities for the
   construction of novel, functional and potentially adaptive phenotypes.
   Finally, we examine the developmental genetic architectures of
   environment-dependent trait expression, and highlight their specific
   implications for the evolutionary origin of novel traits. We critically
   review the empirical evidence supporting each of these processes, and
   propose future experiments and tests that would further illuminate the
   interplay between environmental factors, condition-dependent
   development, and the initiation and elaboration of novel phenotypes.}},

   within a gradient, thereby maximizing nutrient use efficiency at the
   cost of slower growth. Over the shorter term, when locusts were unable
   to find a meal in the normal course of ad libitum feeding, they
   immediately adjusted their thermoregulatory behaviour, selecting a lower
   temperature at which assimilation efficiency was maximal. Thus, locusts
   use fine scale patterns of movement and temperature selection to adjust

   assurance, food avoidance, and animal avoidance. In combination with the
   fear of contracting avian influenza, mental representations associated

   significantly and systematically shape the behavioral responses to the
   perceived threat.
   Conclusions/Significance: This survey provides insight into the nature
   and predictors of the protective patterns that might be expected from

Abstract = {{Senescence may be considered the antithesis of early development, but
   yet there may be factors and mechanisms in common between these two
   phenomena during the process of aging. We investigated whether any
   relationship exists between the regulatory mechanisms that function in
   early development and in senescence using the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a
   small freshwater fish and a useful model animal for genetic studies. We
   conducted experiments to isolate zebrafish mutants expressing an
   apparent senescence phenotype during embryogenesis (embryonic
   senescence). Some of the genes we thereby identified had already been
   associated with cellular senescence and chronological aging in other
   organisms, but many had not yet been linked to these processes. Complete
   loss-of-function of developmentally essential genes induce embryonic (or
   larval) lethality, whereas it seems like their partial loss-of-function
   (i.e., decrease-of-function by heterozygote or hypomorphic mutations)
   still remains sufficient to go through the early developmental process
   because of its adaptive plasticity or rather heterozygote advantage.
   However, in some cases, such partial loss-of-function of genes
   compromise normal homeostasis due to haploinsufficiency later in adult
   life having many environmental stress challenges. By contrast, any
   heterozygote-advantageous genes might gain a certain benefit(s) (much
   more fitness) by such partial loss-of-function later in life.
   Physiological senescence may evolutionarily arise from both genetic and
   epigenetic drifts as well as from losing adaptive developmental
   plasticity in face of stress signals from the external environment that
   interacts with functions of multiple genes rather than effects of only a
   single gene mutation or defect. Previously uncharacterized developmental
   genes may thus mediate the aging process and play a pivotal role in
   senescence. Moreover, unexpected senescence-related genes might also be
   involved in the early developmental process and regulation. We wish to
   ascertain whether we can identify such genes promptly in a comprehensive
   manner. The ease of manipulation using the zebrafish system allows us to
   conduct an exhaustive exploration of novel genes and small molecular
   compounds that can be linked to the senescence phenotype and thereby
   facilitates searching for the evolutionary and developmental origins of
   aging in vertebrates. Birth Defects Research (Part C) 93:229-248, 2011.

Abstract = {{Winter imposes physiological challenges on individuals including
   increased thermoregulatory demands, risk of infection, and decreased
   food availability. To survive these challenges, animals living outside
   the tropics must appropriately distribute their energetic costs across
   the year, including reproduction and immune function. Individuals of
   many species use the annual cycle of changing day lengths (photoperiod),
   which is encoded by the nightly duration of melatonin secretion, to
   adjust physiology. Siberian hamsters exposed to short days (SD) (long
   nights/prolonged endogenous melatonin secretion) enhance some aspects of
   immune function, but curtail other energetically expensive immune
   functions including the febrile response. The purpose of this study was
   twofold. First, we determined whether sustained melatonin treatment
   would inhibit the development of the SD phenotype in female hamsters as
   it does in males. Second, we examined whether the SD attenuation of
   fever would be blocked by continuous exposure to exogenous melatonin.
   Hamsters were implanted with melatonin or empty capsules, housed in
   either long days (LD) or SD for 8-9 weeks, and then challenged with
   lipopolysaccharide; body temperature and locomotor activity were
   recorded. Unlike hamsters with empty capsules, hamsters with melatonin
   implants did not respond to SD and maintained a LD phenotype including
   summer-like spleen, uterine and body masses, and pelage characteristics.
   Further, sustained melatonin treatment blocked the SD attenuation of
   febrile responses and prolonged the behavioral components of the
   sickness response. These results suggest that the daily fluctuations in
   endogenous melatonin may be masked by continuous exposure to exogenous
   melatonin, thus inhibiting functional photoperiodic responses to SD.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives.-The study was designed to compare effects of food
   deprivation (FD) and sleep deprivation (SD) on cognition during survival
   training.
   Methods.-In a cross-over design (n = 12), the effects of FD (up to 66
   hours followed by 500 kcal intake over 24 hours) and SD (up to 50 hours)
   on cognitive variables, blood glucose, and 3-OH-butyrate were studied.
   Results.-Food deprivation and SD impaired attention-dependent tasks. The
   FD impairment of simple reaction time was independent of blood glucose
   levels, which were normalized by a 500 kcal intake over 24 hours while
   the reaction time was not. Sleep deprivation and FD impaired
   maze-solving performance on all variables except rule breaks, which were
   significantly occurring after 50 hours of SD. Delayed word recall was
   impaired by SD for 50 hours. On the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, SD was
   associated with reduced risk-taking. In a gambling task, both SD for 50
   hours and FD for 66 hours were associated with a tendency to make early
   choices when presented with consecutive choices, but the risk-taking was
   not affected.
   Conclusions.-Sleep deprivation has multiple cognitive effects, including
   attention, memory, visual-spatial ability, and risk-taking. Food
   deprivation had no affect on risk-taking, while the other tasks were
   affected in a way similar to SD but were less pronounced. The FD effects
   on cognition did not appear to depend on blood sugar levels. The need to
   sleep should be prioritized in survival situations to avoid cognitive
   impairment.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, females are fed by males during courtship or incubation
   (mate-feeding). According to the mate appraisal hypothesis, females may
   evaluate the parental capacity of males, whereas the pair bond
   hypothesis suggests that feeding may strengthen the pair bonds with
   them. Following the nutrition hypothesis, by contrast, females obtain
   direct nutritional benefits from being fed by males during periods of
   high-energy expenditure, such as egg formation and incubation. However,
   there is little support for these hypotheses at an interspecific level.
   We tested predictions from these hypotheses in a dataset of 170 species
   of passerine birds. As predicted by the nutrition hypothesis, we found
   that mate-feeding has evolved more often in species in which the female
   incubates and builds the nest alone and have noncarnivorous diets. This
   suggests that mate-feeding is a behavioral strategy that compensates for
   nutritional limitations of females during breeding, as both incubation
   and nest building are energetically costly processes, and noncarnivorous
   diets are deficient in proteins. We also found that incubation feeding
   has evolved more often in species that place nests at elevated sites,
   suggesting that these species face low predation risk that allows males
   to feed females. In the particular case of incubation feeding, we found
   that species that have evolved this behavior produce larger clutch size
   and have higher hatching success. Our results support the nutrition
   hypothesis from an interspecific perspective, suggesting that
   matefeeding is a strategy to compensate for nutritional limitations of
   females during reproduction and that it has fitness consequences.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{855-864}},

Abstract = {{Ecological theory suggests that the behaviour, growth and abundance of
   predators will be strongly influenced by the abundance of prey.
   Predators may in turn play an important role in structuring prey
   populations and communities. Responses of predators to variation in prey
   abundance have most commonly been demonstrated in low-diversity
   communities where food webs are relatively simple. How predators respond
   in highly diverse assemblages such as in coral reef habitats is largely
   unknown. This study describes an experiment that examined how the
   movement, diet and growth of the coral reef piscivore, Cephalopholis
   boenak (Serranidae) responded to variation in the abundance of its prey.
   Predator densities were standardised on small patch reefs made from the
   lagoonal reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica. These patch reefs
   exhibited natural variation in the abundance and community structure of
   multiple species of prey. However, our experiment generated a relatively
   simple predator-prey relationship, with C. boenak primarily responding
   to the most abundant species of prey. Three responses of predators were
   observed: aggregative, functional and developmental. Thirty-one per cent
   of individuals moved between patch reefs during the experiment, all from
   areas of relatively low to high prey density. Feeding rates were higher
   on patch reefs of high prey density, while growth rates of fish that
   remained on low prey density reefs throughout the experiment were lower.
   Growth rates of C. boenak on the experimental reefs were also much
   higher than for those living on natural patch reefs over the same time
   period, corresponding with overall differences in prey abundance. These
   results suggest that local abundance, feeding rate and growth of C.
   boenak were closely linked to the abundance of their main prey. This
   combination of predatory responses is a potential mechanism behind
   recent observations of density-dependent mortality and population
   regulation of prey in coral reef fish communities.}},

Abstract = {{1. Predators can reduce herbivory and increase plant biomass by
   consuming herbivores, lowering individual herbivore feeding rates, or
   both. We tested whether the presence of predators increases plant
   quality by non-consumptively reducing grazing pressure and thereby
   weakening the strength of the induced response in plant chemical
   defences.
   2. We performed a 42-day outdoor mesocosm experiment in which the
   herbivorous amphipod Ampithoe longimana was cultured on the brown
   seaweed Sargassum filipendula in the presence and absence of olfactory
   cues of its principal fish predator, the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. The
   presence of fish cues reduced per capita rates of amphipod grazing by
   nearly 50\%. Over the span of the mesocosm experiment, this per capita
   reduction in feeding rate yielded at least a 40\% lower growth rate of
   amphipod populations (i.e. r reduced from 1.01 to 0.61). The lower rates
   of amphipod grazing (overall or per capita) correlated with higher algal
   biomass.
   3. We pursued a series of laboratory-based feeding choice assays with
   naive amphipods to determine tissue palatability and the plant traits
   that mediate feeding choices. Tissue from tanks without grazers was more
   palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers, a pattern of induced
   plant defences that has been documented previously. Surprisingly,
   however, plant tissue from tanks with grazers and fish cues was more
   palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers but without fish cues. All
   changes in algal palatability were mediated by polar, but not lipophilic
   metabolites. These results suggest that the non-consumptive effects of
   fish predators increases the food quality of Sargassum by weakening the
   strength of its induced chemical defences.

   herbivore populations and affect the ecological dynamics of plant
   biomass and chemical defences.}},

Abstract = {{Predation cues influence the strength of byssal attachment in bivalves.
   In zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, anchorage increases in response
   to nonforaging roach, Rutilus rutilus, but decreases in response to
   artificially crushed conspecifics, and it remains unaltered by
   nonforaging crayfish. Given that anchorage to hard substrata protects
   against dislodgement by predators, the defensive value of its weakening
   under predation threat is unclear. Our first experiment examined changes
   in the byssal attachment of zebra mussels in response to active
   predation by the spinycheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus. We found that
   zebra mussels decreased their attachment strength when exposed to cues
   released as crayfish foraged on conspecific mussels. Our second
   experiment tested whether crayfish have a capacity for chemosensory
   detection of live zebra mussels. We exposed hungry crayfish resting in
   shelters to water with or without cues from live mussels. The cues
   stimulated abandonment of shelters. Our results agree with recent
   findings that zebra mussels reduce filter feeding in response to
   predation cues that contain odours of crushed conspecifics. We suggest
   that this response helps zebra mussels to evade odour-navigating
   predators (e.g. crayfish) by suppressing the emission of disclosing
   metabolites, and that a consequence of this physiological suppression is
   a predator-mediated decrease in byssal attachment. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Animals are sensitive to risk or the variability of a reward
   distribution, and the energy budget rule of risk sensitivity theory
   predicts that it is adaptive for an animal to be risk averse when it is
   on a positive energy budget and to be risk prone when it is on a
   negative budget, because the utility of a potential large reward is much
   higher in the latter case. It has, however, been notoriously difficult
   to find conclusive empirical support for these predictions. We performed
   a comprehensive test of the energy budget rule in the honeybee, Apis
   mellifera, by constructing empirical utility functions and by testing
   the choice of bees for a constant or variable reward with an olfactory
   conditioning assay subsequent to manipulating their energy budgets. We
   demonstrate that a decline in energetic state leads to an increasing
   choice for a variable reward, while an increase in energetic state leads
   to an increased choice for a constant reward. We then show that subjects
   maintained on constant high or low energy budgets are risk indifferent,
   which suggests that an animal must perceive a change in its energetic
   state to be risk sensitive. We discuss the challenges of finding
   empirical evidence for the energy budget rule and the necessity of
   integrating physiological assays in these tests. Based on our previous

Abstract = {{The hatchery environment often favours completely different traits than

   usually larger and more aggressive than their wild counterparts.
   Increased growth rate and aggression are predicted to be beneficial in
   feeding competition in hatcheries, but not necessarily in nature, where
   food resources are spatially and temporally more variable. We compared
   the growth, condition and mortality of landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo

   natural prey in semi-natural channels. We found that the growth and
   survival probability of the fish in the hatchery was negatively

   Furthermore, we found tendencies for directional selection (linear
   selection differential and gradient: P < 0.1, in both cases) against
   large body size in semi-natural channels, but not in the hatchery.
   Therefore, good performance during hatchery rearing may indicate reduced
   performance in food-limited natural conditions, where selection may
   favour smaller individuals that have a lower standard metabolic rate

Abstract = {{1. Dispersal is a key process in population biology and ecology.
   Although the general ecological conditions that lead to dispersal have
   been well studied, the causes of individual variation in dispersal are
   less well understood. A number of recent studies suggest that heritable
   temperament - or personality - traits are correlated with dispersal in
   the wild but the extent to which these `personality-dispersal syndromes'
   are general, how they depend on an individual's state and on spatial
   scale and whether they are temporally stable, both within and across
   individuals, remains unclear.
   2. Here, we examine the relationship between exploration behaviour - an
   axis of personality that appears to be important in animals generally -
   and a variety of dispersal processes over 6 years in a population of the
   great tit Parus major.
   3. Exploration behaviour was higher in immigrant than in locally born
   juveniles, but the difference was much larger for individuals with a
   small body mass, though independent of sex, representing one of the
   first examples of a state-dependent effect in a personality-dispersal
   syndrome.
   4. Despite a temporal trend in exploration behaviour at the population
   level, the difference between immigrants and locally born birds remained
   stable over time, both across and within individuals. This suggests that
   the personality difference between immigrants and locally born birds is
   established early in development, but that the process of immigration
   interacts with both personality and state.
   5. We found that the number of immigrant parents a locally born bird had
   did not influence exploration behaviour, suggesting either the
   difference between immigrants and residents was environmental or that
   the effect is overridden by local environmental sources of variation.
   6. In contrast to previous work, we found no evidence for links between
   personality and natal dispersal distance within the population, either
   in terms of an individual's own exploration behaviour or that of its
   parents.
   7. Our results suggest that there are links between individual
   differences in personality and dispersal, but that these can be
   dependent on differences in state among individuals and on the scale
   over which dispersal is measured. Future work should aim to understand
   the differences between dispersal within and between populations and the
   ways in which personality and state interact to determine the outcome of
   these processes.}},

Abstract = {{1. Individuals of the same species often exhibit consistent differences
   in metabolic rate, but the effects of such differences on ecologically
   important behaviours remain largely unknown. In particular, it is
   unclear whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between
   metabolic rate and the tendency to take risks while foraging.
   Individuals with higher metabolic rates may need to take greater risks
   while foraging to obtain the additional food required to satisfy their
   energy requirements. Such a relationship could be exacerbated by food
   deprivation if a higher metabolic demand also causes greater mass loss
   and hunger.
   2. We investigated relationships among metabolic rate, risk-taking and
   tolerance of food deprivation in juvenile European sea bass. Individual
   fish were tested for risk-taking behaviours following a simulated
   predator attack, both before and after a 7-day period of food
   deprivation. The results were then related to their routine metabolic
   rate (RMR), which was measured throughout the period of food
   deprivation.
   3. The amount of risk displayed by individual fish before food
   deprivation showed no relationship with RMR. After food deprivation,
   however, the amount of risk among individuals was positively correlated
   with RMR. In general, most fish showed an increase in risk-taking after
   food deprivation, and the magnitude of the increase in risk-taking was
   correlated with the rate of individual mass loss during food
   deprivation, which was itself strongly correlated with RMR.
   4. The observation that RMR was related to risk-taking behaviour after
   food deprivation, but not before, suggests that although RMR can
   influence risk-taking, the strength of the relationship is flexible and
   context dependent. The effects of RMR on risk-taking may be subtle or
   non-existent in regularly feeding animals, but may lead to variability
   in risk-taking among individuals when food is scarce or supply is
   unpredictable. This synergistic relationship between RMR and food
   deprivation could lead to an increased likelihood of being predated for
   individuals with a relatively high intrinsic energy demand during times
   when food is scarce.}},

Abstract = {{The mosquito Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is the main vector of dengue
   and yellow fever viruses. Different methods have been used to control A.
   aegypti, including chemical and biological tools. However, chemical
   control can lead to a subsequent increase in the mosquitoes' insecticide
   resistance, and biological control represents an important method as an
   alternative to insecticide usage. Larvae from the Toxorhynchites genus
   (Diptera: Culicidae) are predators of other mosquitoes and represent a
   potential natural biocontrol agent of A. aegypti larvae. In the present
   work, A. aegypti larval survival was studied in the presence of the
   neotropical Toxorhynchites violaceus (Wiedemann, 1821) fourth instar
   larvae. Toxorhynchites violaceus consumption of A. aegypti increased
   during the 192 hours of the experiment and was more marked in the
   intervals between 96 and 120 hours and between 168 and 192 hours, when
   the A. aegypti survival reached 0\%. During the fourth instar, T
   violaceus increased its predation on A. aegypti larvae, possibly in
   order to increase its nutrient storage prior to pupation. Otherwise, low
   prey consumption can lead to a nutritional deficit for the larvae,
   delaying the adult's sexual development and reducing its egg production.
   Here we show that A. aegypti survival can be reduced by the T violaceus
   fourth larvae predation under laboratory conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Enrichment aims to improve captive animals' welfare by enhancing their
   environments. Two of the struggles associated with measuring welfare are
   identifying when animals' needs are being met or surpassed and
   identifying how individual differences play a role in these outcomes.
   Using a group of related Guyanese squirrel monkeys, we studied changes
   in five welfare indicators under different environmental conditions.
   Manipulating food presentation, walkways, and toys, we created five
   enrichment levels ranging from just above USDA standards to considerably
   more complex than the animals' normal housing. At the end of each level,
   a novelty test was performed in which an unfamiliar woman entered the
   enclosure and offered food. Changes in behavior as a function of
   enrichment condition were analyzed using a repeated-measures MANOVA.
   Compared to baseline, less enrichment consistently increased negative
   welfare indicators (abnormal behavior, aggression, and negative
   responses to the novelty test), while more enrichment sometimes
   decreased these indicators. Positive welfare indicators were less
   consistently related to enrichment, but positive response to the novelty
   test did increase somewhat in the most enriched condition. Across
   conditions, rank correlations revealed that individuals had highly
   consistent individual differences in positive responses to novelty and
   somewhat consistent individual differences in rates of aggression. The
   goal of the enrichment and the species, sex, and individual animals to
   be enriched should be considered when selecting a welfare indicator, and
   facilities measuring animal welfare should study changes in the behavior
   of specific individuals to control for individual differences.}},

Abstract = {{Visitors are known to affect zoo animals, and such effects may be
   stressful, neutral, or enriching. The majority of research has focused
   on visitor number or visitor presence-absence, yet few studies have
   examined effects of other variables such as sound volume, visitor
   activity, and whether visitors interact with animals. In this study, the
   effects of visitor number, activity and proximity to animals were
   investigated on a group of captive orangutans in two treetop,
   `free-ranging' exhibits at Singapore Zoo. Multinomial logistic
   regressions were used to elucidate the relationships between visitor and
   orangutan behaviours. Results from these analyses revealed a significant
   overall effect of the three visitor variables on orangutan behaviour.
   Interestingly, visitor number had little effect on the orangutans,
   except at one of the exhibits where the likelihood of food soliciting
   and looking at visitors increased when the number of people numbered
   more than 40. Visitor activity was generally not associated with any
   obvious signs of stress in the orangutans; visitors with food could even
   be a form of enrichment. However, visitors at close proximity decreased
   play behaviour and increased the chances of animals looking at the
   visitors. Enclosure design and habituation could have alleviated visitor
   effects for these two groups of orangutans. This study shows how
   investigation of a wider range of visitor variables may allow for more
   meaningful conclusions about the visitor effect, and that other factors
   such as enclosure design and habituation to visitors may also influence
   captive animal welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animals adjust their antipredator behavior according to environmental
   variation in risk, and to account for their ability to respond to
   threats. Intrinsic factors that influence an animal's ability to respond
   to predators (e. g., age, body condition) should explain variation in
   antipredator behavior. For example, a juvenile might allocate more time
   to vigilance than an adult because mortality as a result of predation is
   often high for this age class; however, the relationship between
   age/vulnerability and antipredator behavior is not always clear or as
   predicted. We explored the influence of intrinsic factors on
   yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) antipredator behavior using
   data pooled from 4 years of experiments. We hypothesized that inherently
   vulnerable animals (e. g., young, males, and individuals in poor
   condition) would exhibit more antipredator behavior prior to and
   immediately following conspecific alarm calls. As expected, males and
   yearlings suppressed foraging more than females and adults following
   alarm call playbacks. In contrast to predictions, animals in better
   condition respond more than animals in below average condition.
   Interestingly, these intrinsic properties did not influence baseline
   time budgets; animals of all ages, sexes, and condition levels devoted
   comparable amounts of time to foraging prior to alarm calls. Our results
   support the hypothesis that inherent differences in vulnerability
   influence antipredator behavior; furthermore, it appears that a crucial,
   but poorly acknowledged, interaction exists between risk and
   state-dependence. Elevated risk may be required to reveal the workings
   of state-dependent behavior, and studies of antipredator behavior in a
   single context may draw incomplete conclusions about age-or sex-specific
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroimmunological and behavioral consequences of a high-fat diet
   (HFD) are not well delineated. This is especially true when short term
   (24 h) fasting is used as a physiologic stressor. In this study, we
   examined the impact of a HFD on learning and memory and depressive-like
   behaviors to understand how fasting impacts neuroimmunity and whether
   obesity modulates the response. Mice were fed diets containing either
   10\% (low-fat diet (LFD) mice) or 60\% (HFD mice) calories from fat for
   10-12 weeks. Gene transcripts for 26 pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines
   and markers of macrophage activation were examined in adipose tissue and
   whole brain. Mouse learning and memory (spontaneous alternation, novel
   object) and depressive-like behaviors (saccharin preference, burrowing,
   forced swim) were studied in the fed and fasted state as were gene
   transcripts for F4/80, CD11b, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1
   beta, IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-1RA, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in
   cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. In the fed state, HFD mice
   compared to LFD mice had reduced locomotor activity, and were adverse to
   saccharin and burrowed less. After fasting, LFD mice vs. HFD mice lost
   18 vs. 5\% of their body weight, respectively. In addition, HFD mice
   failed to downregulate gene transcripts for the myeloid-cell associated
   proteins F4/80, CD11b and IL-1 alpha in the brain, failed to
   appropriately explore a novel object, failed to reduce locomotor
   activity and had increased saccharin consumption and burrowing. These
   data indicate that fasting induces an anti-inflammatory effect on the
   neuroimmune system which a HFD prevents. This breakdown appears linked
   to the IL-1 system because of the association of this cytokine with

Abstract = {{Male mate choice is predicted to evolve as male investment in mating
   increases. Thus, taxa in which males pay a high cost for mating offer
   researchers an ideal system to test traditional sex roles. Males
   courting potentially sexually cannibalistic females may be under strong
   selection to bias their courtship efforts away from hungry females that
   may be more likely to attack. Here we tested the prediction that
   web-based chemotactile cues of recent female foraging success influence
   male courtship in the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. In
   addition, we tested the underlying assumption that previous female
   foraging success reduces precopulatory sexually cannibalistic attacks.
   We found that males courted well-fed females significantly more than
   they did starved females, and that this bias was maintained in the
   absence of the female when males encountered only (1) cues from female
   webs and (2) cues from female silk after web architecture had been
   eliminated. A nonsignificant courtship bias in favour of well-fed
   females was also evident when these females were transplanted to the
   webs of starved females. Male courtship biases in favour of well-fed
   females appear adaptive, as starved females were significantly more
   likely to attack males before mating. We conclude by noting that sexual
   cannibalism offers a model system wherein the exploitation of cues of
   predation risk have unique implications such as the effects on male
   courtship preferences seen here. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Foraging theory was first developed to predict the behaviour of
   widely-foraging animals that actively search for prey. Although the
   behaviour of sit-and-wait predators often follows predictions derived
   from foraging theory, the similarity between these two distinct groups
   of predators is not always obvious. In this review, we compare foraging
   activities of trap-building predators (mainly pit-building antlions and
   web-building spiders), a specific group of sit-and-wait predators that
   construct traps as a foraging device, with those of widely-foraging
   predators. We refer to modifications of the trap characteristics as
   analogous to changes in foraging intensity. Our review illustrates that
   the responses of trap-building and widely-foraging predators to
   different internal and external factors, such as hunger level,
   conspecific density and predation threat are quite similar, calling for
   additional studies of foraging theory using trap-building predators. In
   each chapter of this review, we summarize the response of trap-building
   predators to a different factor, while contrasting it with the
   equivalent response characterizing widely-foraging predators. We provide
   here evidence that the behaviour of trap-building predators is not
   stereotypic or fixed as was once commonly accepted, rather it can vary
   greatly, depending on the individual's internal state and its

Abstract = {{In the laboratory, food restriction has been shown to induce
   neuroadaptations in brain reward circuitry which are likely to be among
   those that facilitate survival during periods of food scarcity in the
   wild. However, the upregulation of mechanisms that promote foraging and
   reward-related learning may pose a hazard when food restriction is
   self-imposed in an ecology of abundant appetitive rewards. For example,
   episodes of loss of control during weight-loss dieting, use of drugs
   with addictive potential as diet aids, and alternating fasting with
   alcohol consumption in order to avoid weight gain, may induce synaptic
   plasticity that increases the risk of enduring maladaptive
   reward-directed behavior. In the present mini-review, representative
   basic research findings are outlined which indicate that food
   restriction alters the function of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons,
   potentiates cellular and behavioral responses to D-1 and D-2 dopamine
   receptor stimulation, and increases stimulus-induced synaptic insertion
   of AMPA receptors in nucleus accumbens. Possible mechanistic
   underpinnings of increased drug reward magnitude, drug-seeking, and
   binge intake of sucrose in food-restricted animal subjects are discussed

Abstract = {{It has been well documented that nutritional state can influence the
   foraging behavior of animals. However, photosynthetic animals, those
   capable of both heterotrophy and symbiotic photosynthesis, may have a
   delayed behavioral response due to their ability to photosynthesize. To
   test this hypothesis we subjected groups of the kleptoplastic sea slug,
   Elysia clarki, to a gradient of starvation treatments of 4, 8, and 12
   weeks plus a satiated control. Compared to the control group, slugs
   starved 8 and 12 weeks displayed a significant increase in the

   capability, as measured in maximum quantum yield and {[}chl a]. The 4
   week group, however, showed no significant difference in feeding
   behavior or in the metrics of photosynthesis compared to the control.
   This suggests that photosynthesis in E. clarki, thought to be linked to

   cytokine responsiveness in lipopolysaccharide-challenged adult offspring}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The preimplantation embryo is sensitive to culture
   conditions in vitro and poor maternal diet in vivo. Such environmental
   perturbations can have long-lasting detrimental consequences for
   offspring health and physiology. However, early embryo susceptibility to
   other aspects of maternal health and their potential long-term influence
   into adulthood is relatively unexplored. In this study, we established
   an in vivo mouse model of maternal periconceptional systemic
   inflammation by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration
   on the day of zygote formation and investigated the consequences into
   adulthood.
   Results: In the short term, maternal LPS challenge induced a transient
   and typical maternal sickness response (elevated serum proinflammatory
   cytokines and hypoactive behaviour). Maternal LPS challenge altered
   preimplantation embryo morphogenesis and cell lineage allocation,
   resulting in reduced blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM) cell number and a
   reduced ICM: trophectoderm cell ratio. In the long term, diverse aspects
   of offspring physiology were affected by maternal LPS treatment. Whilst
   birthweight, growth and adult blood pressure were unaltered, reduced
   activity in an open-field behaviour test, increased fat pad: body weight
   ratio and increased body mass index were observed in male, but not
   female, offspring. Most importantly, the maternal LPS challenge caused
   corticosterone-independent blunting of the serum proinflammatory
   cytokine response to innate immune challenge in both male and female
   offspring. The suppressed state of innate immunity in challenged
   offspring was dose-dependent with respect to the maternal LPS
   concentration administered.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate for the first time that the
   preimplantation embryo in vivo is sensitive to maternal systemic
   inflammation, with effects on blastocyst cell lineage allocation and
   consequences for behaviour, adiposity and innate immune response in
   adult offspring. Critically, we identify a novel mechanism mediated
   through maternal-embryonic interactions that confers plasticity in the
   development of the innate immune system, which is potentially important
   in setting postnatal tolerance to environmental pathogens. Our study
   extends the concept of developmental programming of health and disease
   to include maternal health at the time of conception.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that access to high caloric food attenuates stress

   chow enriched with glucose and fat, here referred to as comfort food
   alters behavioral, metabolic, and hormonal parameters of rats submitted
   to three daily sessions of foot-shock stress. Food intake, anxiety-like
   behaviors, and serum levels of insulin, leptin, corticosterone. glucose
   and triglycerides were determined. The rats submitted to stress
   decreased the intake of commercial chow, but kept unaltered the intake
   of comfort food. During the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, stressed rats
   increased the number of head dipping, entries into the open arms, as
   well as the time spent there, and decreased the number of
   stretched-attend posture and risk assessment. These effects of stress
   were independent of the type of food consumed. Non-stressed rats
   ingesting comfort food decreased risk assessment as well. Stress and
   comfort food increased time spent in the center of the open field and
   delayed the first crossing to a new quadrant. Stress increased the
   plasma level of glucose and insulin, and reduced triglycerides, although
   consumption of comfort food increases glucose, triglyceride and leptin
   levels; no effect on leptin level was associated to stress. The stress
   induced increase in serum corticosterone was attenuated when rats had
   access to comfort food. It was concluded that foot-shock stress has an
   anorexigenic effect that is independent of leptin and prevented upon
   access to comfort food. Foot-shock stress also has an anxiolytic effect
   that is potentiated by the ingestion of comfort food and that is
   evidenced by both EPM and open field tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

   instar larvae were predated at the highest rate. Third instar larvae of
   An. gambiae were introduced into artificial habitats with and without
   refugia at various larval densities. The numbers of surviving larvae
   were counted after 24 hours in 24. In semi-field experiments, the larvae
   were counted daily until they were all either consumed or had developed
   to the pupal stage. Polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the
   presence of An. gambiae DNA in predator guts.
   Results: Experiments found that habitat type (P < 0.0001) and predator
   species (P < 0.0001) had a significant impact on the predation rate in
   the 24 hour evaluations. In semi-field experiments, predator species (P
   < 0.0001) and habitat type (P < 0.0001) were significant factors in both
   the daily survival and the overall developmental time of larvae.
   Pupation rates took significantly longer in habitats with refugia. An.
   gambiae DNA was found in at least three out of ten midguts for all
   predator species. Gambusia affins was the most efficient, being three
   times more efficient than tadpoles.
   Conclusion: These experiments provide insight into the efficiency of
   specific natural predators against mosquito larvae. These naturally
   occurring predators may be useful in biocontrol strategies for aquatic
   stage An. gambiae mosquitoes. Further investigations should be done in
   complex natural habitats for these predators.}},

Title = {{DSM-V. Lights and shadows of an unpublished manual. Challenges and

Abstract = {{Throughout its history, one of the most fascinating topics of psychiatry
   has been that of the causes and consequences of mental disorders. The
   desire to strengthen the reliability of diagnosis in this area has led
   to significant advances in two important fields: psychopathological
   description and the formulation of an integral diagnosis.
   Classifications allow the definition of categories and in the case of
   the two most read taxonomies in the field of mental health, Diagnostic
   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International
   Classification of Diseases (ICD), these provide the most commonly used
   criteria for diagnosis. The revised fourth edition of the DSM is now
   insufficient to cover the ever greater clinical challenges and research.
   For over ten years, work has been carried out on the structure of DSM-V
   (the fifth edition), but despite the planning, organization, prediction,
   and the contributions of guest experts, it is feared that all the
   requirements of modern psychiatry will not be met. The first edition of
   DSM was published in the 1950s. It was based on the terminology
   developed by William Meninger. This version of the manual and the
   following, published several years later, reflected the psychodynamic
   psychiatry which prevailed at the time. The third edition was published
   in 1980 and its revised edition seven years later. The emphasis here was
   on descriptive and syndromatic considerations. The fourth edition
   appeared several years later. The most striking change in this edition
   was the inclusion of variables resulting from empirical studies. A later
   edition was published in the year 2000.
   The first attempts to put together DSM-V started in 1999. From 1999
   until 2007 work was done on the planning of the investigation and
   technical documentation of DSM-V and the inclusion of the so called
   investigation schedules. The second phase of the project, known as the
   refinement of the research program for DSM-V, was carried out between
   2004 and 2007. A pilot test was undertaken between January and May 2010,
   among different segments of the population and different settings, to
   evaluate the revisions proposed by the working teams. Between March and
   April 2011, as a result of the field tests, the proposed criteria for
   diagnosis were reviewed. The dimensional measurements and the criteria
   for diagnosis will be reviewed again during the rest of 2011. The year
   2012 will see the preparation of the final version of the text, and
   finally, in May 2013, DSM-V will be presented at the annual meeting of
   the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco, California.
   Several external and independent authors have offered numerous proposals
   on topics related to psychopathology in general to the working groups
   formed for the preparation of DSM-V. Only some of these are mentioned
   below. One of the first factors to be taken into consideration in the
   revision of the manual is the need to distinguish between empirical
   questions or approaches and those of a more conceptual or philosophical
   nature, which should, by no means, be excluded. Another point to be
   evaluated is the advisability of defining phases according to the
   development of the condition, which would ideally create a schema
   focused on prevention. One of the expectations of psychiatry is that
   eventually laboratory criteria of diagnosis could be established, which
   could be measurable and would lead to clear statistics of psychiatric
   pathologies. As far as somatomorphic disorders are concerned, many
   practitioners agree that the current terminology and the systems of
   classification are inaccurate. One proposal is that this category should
   be eliminated altogether and that diagnoses should be made using an
   additional multidimensional description. One of the most interesting
   features of DSM is that it has had to accommodate changes brought about
   by new technologies. These advances go hand in hand with a new series of
   pathologies which need to be classified, as is the addiction to
   Internet.
   Undoubtedly, one of the greatest dilemmas facing DSM is how to classify
   eating disorders, as many people feel that the rather simplistic
   distinction between nervous anorexia and bulimia is not altogether
   convincing. There are two interesting proposals to consider in DSM-V:
   one is known as night eater syndrome and obesity, as in this case there
   is a compulsive consumption of food and an inability to limit this
   intake, in spite of a desire to do so. With regard to the compulsive,
   obsessive disorder, most experts believe that it is necessary to see the
   disorder as a spectrum, but defining criteria. Undeniably, a grave
   current problem which makes no distinctions is suicide. Different
   researchers recommend that suicidal behavior be considered and
   documented as a separate diagnosis in a sixth axis of the multioxis
   schema. Another important aspect concerns the giving of quality
   attention to patients. This has led to the proposal to expand DSM-V to
   include indicators for situations which could eventually be a cause for
   treatment. The proposal is to structure something different from what
   can be found in axis IV. In the case of paraphilias, it is deemed
   necessary that DSM-V should deal not only with the strictly descriptive
   aspect, but also with the semantic and linguistic. The importance of
   post-traumatic stress has been described, but there exists the doubt
   whether it is necessary to experience an adverse incident for this to be
   triggered. There has been a suggestion that the term ``pre-traumatic{''}
   stress disorder be included in DSM-V to diagnose this condition. In the
   case of anxiety disorders, some authors advise the creation of a
   category known as ``disorders caused by stress and fear{''}, which would
   allow linking the diagnostic classification with etiology and thus
   define a ``true{''} anxiety nosology. It would be advisable that the
   DSM-V included a category for ``seasonal affective disorder{''} as such,
   and not simply as a variant in the ``specification of the seasonal
   pattern{''} of depression. In the field of substance consumption, it has
   been argued that it is necessary to establish a classification which is
   not only categoric but also dimensional so as to improve its taxonomic
   usefulness. The organization of mental disorders in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10
   (tenth edition) is complex and this has led to exploring the feasibility
   of developing a meta-structural system of classification based on risk
   and clinical factors. For disorders originated in infancy, childhood and
   adolescence, it has been suggested that the disorder known as
   ``temperament disorder by disphoria{''} be included in the forthcoming
   taxonomy, as well as the use of the terms insensitive/emotionless for
   behavioral disorders, among others. In the case of attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the current criteria are considered
   insufficient and it has been suggested that the starting age for this
   disorder be increased from 7 to 12 years of age. It is suggested that
   autism be considered autistic spectrum, thus eliminating the other
   disorders covered in this section, including Asperger syndrome.
   The question as to whether this taxonomic-diagnostic system, to be
   implemented world-wide, will be both valid and reliable enough to cover
   all variations and particular characteristics of different cultures,
   ethnic groups, social groups and geographical regions in Mexico is
   another matter of concern, due to the lack of tools available for daily
   clinical work, except for the International Classification of Diseases
   of the World Health Organization. There are, at present, a number of
   doubts and queries which will need to be laid open and evaluated in all
   seriousness in order to obtain concrete and integral answers, given that
   the manual will continue to be used for clinical purposes in different
   parts of the world. The challenge will be to find the best way to apply
   diagnostic criteria, avoiding omissions and oversimplifications and
   taking into account the cultural and social context worked in.}},

Abstract = {{There is now evidence that developmental influences have lifelong
   effects on cardiovascular and metabolic function and that elements of
   the heritable or familial component of susceptibility to cardiovascular
   disease, obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCD) can be
   transmitted across generations by non-genomic means. In animals the
   developmental environment induces altered phenotypes through genetic,
   physiological (especially endocrine) and epigenetic mechanisms. The
   latter include DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histones and
   non-coding RNAs. Such `tuning' of phenotype has potential adaptive value
   and may confer Darwinian fitness advantage because it either adjusts the
   phenotype to current circumstances and/or attempts to match an
   individual's responses to the environment predicted to be experienced
   later. When the phenotype is mismatched to the later environment, e.g.
   from inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before
   birth, or from rapid environmental change through improved
   socio-economic conditions, risk of NCD increases. Such mechanisms are
   also thought to play roles in ageing and early onset of puberty,
   reinforcing a life-course perspective on such adaptive responses,
   especially the detrimental later effects of trade-offs. Epigenetic
   changes induced during development are highly gene-specific and function
   at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides in both gene promoter and
   intergenic regions. Evidence is accruing that endocrine or nutritional
   interventions during early postnatal life can reverse epigenetic and
   phenotypic changes induced, for example, by unbalanced maternal diet
   during pregnancy. Elucidation of epigenetic processes may permit
   perinatal identification of individuals most at risk of later NCD and
   enable early intervention strategies to reduce such risk. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Hatcheries often produce bold fish that are maladapted to survive in the
   wild, as absence of predators and selection for fast growth tend to
   favour risk-taking behaviors. Not surprisingly, losses of hatchery fish
   through predation can be high immediately after release and this may
   account for the failure of many ex-situ fish conservation programmes.
   For supportive-breeding to be useful, it is essential that released fish
   are able to display natural behaviors. We compared the performance of
   juvenile Atlantic salmon reared in environmentally-enriched tanks
   receiving natural prey and subjected to simulated predator attacks with
   fish reared under standard hatchery conditions while keeping densities
   constant. No differences were detected between controls and
   environmentally enriched fish in survival, final size or nutritional
   status. Yet, changes in rearing conditions had rapid and marked effects
   on risk-taking behavior. Environmentally enriched fish were 2.1 times
   less willing, and took significantly longer to leave shelter, than
   controls within two weeks of enrichment. Thus our study indicates that
   it is possible through environmental enrichment to modify at least one
   component of fishes' behavior known to have clear adaptive implications,
   i.e. the propensity of hatchery-reared fish to take excessive risks.
   Ex-situ conservation could therefore benefit from rearing fish in
   naturalized, structurally complex environments with natural prey to
   promote the development of more natural behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As farm animal welfare is high on the political and societal agendas of
   many countries, considerable pressure exists to establish audit programs
   in which farm animal welfare is routinely monitored. On-farm assessment
   of animal welfare, however, is time-consuming and costly. A promising
   strategy to monitor animal welfare more efficiently is to first estimate
   the level of animal welfare on a farm based on routine herd data that
   are available in national databases. It is not currently known which
   variables of routine herd data (VRHD) are associated with dairy cattle
   welfare indicators (WI). Our aim was to identify VRHD that are
   associated with WI in a literature review. The 27 VRHD used in this
   review included the main types of data that are currently collected in
   national herd databases of developed countries, and related to
   identification and registration, management, milk production, and
   reproduction of dairy herds. The 34 WI used in this review were based on
   the Welfare Quality Assessment Protocol for Cattle. The search yielded
   associations in 146 studies. Twenty-three VRHD were associated with 16
   WI. The VRHD that related to milk yield, culling, and reproduction were
   associated with the largest number of WI. Few associations were found
   for WI that referred to behavioral aspects of animal welfare,
   nonspecific disease symptoms, or resources-based indicators. For 18 WI,
   associations with VRHD were not significant (n = 5 WI) or no studies
   were found that investigated associations with VRHD (n = 13 WI). It was
   concluded that many VRHD have potential to estimate the level of animal
   welfare on dairy farms. As strengths of associations were not considered
   in this review, however, the true value of these VRHD should be further
   explored. Moreover, associations found at the animal level and in an
   experimental setting might not appear at the farm level and in common
   practice and should be investigated. Cross-sectional studies using
   integrated welfare scores at the farm level are needed to more
   accurately determine the potential of VRHD to estimate levels of animal
   welfare on dairy farms.}},

Abstract = {{Seed selection, removal and subsequent management by granivorous animals
   is thought to be a complex interaction of factors including qualities of
   the seeds themselves (e.g., seed size, nutritional quality) and features
   of the local habitat (e.g. perceived predator risk). At the same time,
   differential seed selection and dispersal is thought to have profound
   effects on seed fate and potentially vegetation dynamics. In a feeding
   arena, we tested whether rodent species, seed species, and indirect and
   direct predation cues influence seed selection and handling behaviors
   (e.g., scatter hoarding versus larder hoarding) of two heteromyid
   rodents, Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) and the Great Basin pocket
   mouse (Perognathus parvus). The indirect cue was shrub cover, a feature
   of the environment. Direct cues, presented individually, were (1)
   control, (2) coyote (Canis latrans) vocalization, (3) coyote scent, (4)
   red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scent, or (5) short-eared owl (Asio flammeus)
   vocalization. We offered seeds of three sizes: two native grasses,
   Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) and bluebunch wheatgrass
   (Pseudoroegneria spicata), and the non-native cereal rye (Secale
   cereale), each in separate trays. Kangaroo rats preferentially harvested
   Indian ricegrass while pocket mice predominately harvested Indian
   ricegrass and cereal rye. Pocket mice were more likely to scatter hoard
   preferred seeds, whereas kangaroo rats mostly consumed and/or larder
   hoarded preferred seeds. No predator cue significantly affected seed
   preferences. However, both species altered seed handling behavior in
   response to direct predation cues by leaving more seeds available in the
   seed pool, though they responded to different predator cues. If these
   results translate to natural dynamics on the landscape, the two rodents
   are expected to have different impacts on seed survival and plant
   recruitment via their different seed selection and seed handling
   behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{400-409}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Until recently, obesity was considered the product of interactions
   between genotype and lifestyle. However, recent work suggests that the
   genetic heritability of adiposity has been over-estimated, whilst
   epidemiological studies show that although many genes are associated
   with nutritional status, the effect of each is very small. A polygenic
   basis of obesity risk may arise through bet-hedging of numerous traits
   to accommodate diverse unpredictable environments, rather than through
   systematic local adaptation. Such `fragmentation' of the genetic
   component of metabolism across multiple alleles may be a necessary
   pre-requisite for complementary enhancement of phenotypic plasticity.
   The inter-generational component of obesity refers to phenotypic effects
   transmitted across generations, arising from exposure to maternal,
   familial and environmental niches during development. Inter-generational
   transfers of somatic capital (height, lean mass) may respond to
   ecological conditions through a slow-response damping system, through
   the influence of maternal phenotype on offspring growth and body
   composition. The primary traits subject to inter-generational effects
   may be physique and life history strategy, with adiposity both aiding
   and responding as a flexible risk management strategy. The biological
   processes that underpin the offspring's developmental plasticity appear
   sensitive to the obesogenic niche. Through this sensitivity, diverse
   environmental factors can induce excess weight gain from childhood
   onwards.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We evaluated monozygotic twin pairs with discordant

   Design: Case series.
   Participants: Caucasian male twin pairs from the United States Twin
   Study of Macular Degeneration.
   Methods: Twin pairs were genotyped to confirm monozygosity. Ocular
   characteristics were evaluated based on fundus photographs using the
   Wisconsin Grading System and a 5-grade Clinical Age-Related Maculopathy
   Staging System. We selected twin pairs discordant in each of the
   following phenotypic categories: Stage of AMD (n = 28), drusen area (n =
   60), drusen size (n = 40), and increased pigment area (n = 56). The
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression were used to assess

   Main Outcome Measures: Differences in smoking and dietary factors within
   twin pairs discordant for stage of AMD, drusen area, drusen size, and
   pigment area.
   Results: Representative fundus photographs depict the discordant
   phenotypes. Pack-years of smoking were higher for the twin with the more
   advanced stage of AMD (P = 0.05). Higher dietary intake of vitamin D was
   present in the twins with less severe AMD (P = 0.01) and smaller drusen
   size (P = 0.05) compared with co-twins, adjusted for smoking and age.
   Dietary intakes of betaine and methionine were significantly higher in

   = 0.03), respectively.
   Conclusions: The twin with the more advanced stage of AMD, larger drusen
   area, drusen size, and pigment area tended to be the heavier smoker. The
   twin with the earlier stage of AMD, smaller drusen size and area, and
   less pigment tended to have higher dietary vitamin D, betaine, or
   methionine intake. Results suggest that behavioral and nutritional
   factors associated with epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the
   etiology of AMD, in addition to genetic susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess convergent validity, factorial validity,
   test-retest reliability and internal consistency of a diet quality food
   behaviour checklist (FBC) for low-literate, low-income Spanish speakers.
   Design: Participants (n 90) completed three dietary recalls, the
   Spanish-language version of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and the Spanish-language
   FBC. Factor structure was examined using principal component analysis.
   Spearman correlation coefficients between FBC item responses and
   nutrient intakes from 24 h recalls were used to estimate convergent
   validity. Correlation coefficients were also calculated between FBC item
   responses at two time points in another group of participants (n 71) to
   examine test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was
   determined for items within each sub-scale.
   Setting: Non-profit community agencies serving low-income clients,
   migrant farm worker camps and low-income housing sites in four
   California counties.
   Subjects: Spanish-speaking women (n 161) who met income eligibility for
   the SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education).
   Results: Factor analysis resulted in six sub-scales. Responses to
   nineteen food behaviour items were significantly correlated with
   hypothesized 24 h recall data (with a maximum correlation of 0.44 for
   drinking milk and calcium) or the USDA HFSSM (0.42 with the food
   security item). Coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from
   0.35 to 0.79. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.49 for the diet quality
   sub-scale to 0.80 for the fruit and vegetable sub-scale.
   Conclusions: The twenty-two-item FBC and instruction guide will be used
   to evaluate USDA community nutrition education interventions with
   low-literate Spanish speakers. This research contributes to the body of
   knowledge about this at-risk population in California.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviour associated with the defence of a territory is
   thought to impose substantial energy costs and thus to represent a
   trade-off with other energy-demanding activities. The energy costs of
   aggressive behaviours, however, have rarely been estimated in the wild,
   and the overall contribution of territorial defence to daily energy
   expenditure has never been determined. We studied the activity budget of
   breeding king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, equipped with heart
   rate data loggers to estimate the energy costs associated with territory
   defence in this colonial bird exhibiting very high rates of agonistic
   interactions. We also assessed whether threat displays imposed lower
   energy costs than attacks with body contact. During territorial defence
   (i.e. threats and physical attacks combined), energy expenditure
   averaged 1.27 times resting metabolic rate. Defence accounted for 13\%
   of the daily time budget and contributed to 2.7\% of the total daily
   energy expenditure. Interactions with body contact cost three times more
   than threat displays, but accounted for only 16\% of the aggressive
   behaviours recorded. Neither did body mass, body size, penguin sex or
   breeding stage affect the cost of aggressiveness. Our results are
   consistent with previous research reporting that fighting imposes
   significant metabolic costs. However, we found that aggressive behaviour
   in king penguins was not an expensive activity compared to the total
   energy budget. Because king penguins go without food and are sleep
   deprived while breeding, they may have developed behavioural strategies
   (e.g. lower rates of attacks with body contact) allowing them to defend
   their territory efficiently at a low energy cost. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Proinflammatory adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) contribute to
   obesity-associated disease morbidity. We will provide an update of the
   current state of knowledge regarding the phenotypic and functional
   diversity of ATMs in lean and obese mice and humans.
   Recent findings
   The phenotypic diversity of ATMs is now known to include more than two
   types requiring an expansion of the simple concept of an M2 to M1 shift
   with obesity. Potential functions for ATMs now include the regulation of
   fibrosis and response to acute lipolysis in states of caloric
   restriction. Novel pathways that can potentiate ATM action have been
   identified, which include inflammasome activation and the response to
   lipodystrophic adipose tissue. Studies provide a new appreciation for
   the ability of ATMs to respond dynamically to the adipose tissue
   microenvironment.
   Summary
   ATMs play a key role in shaping the inflammatory milieu within adipose
   tissue, and it is now apparent that ATM heterogeneity is acutely shaped
   by the adipose tissue environment. To account for the new findings, we
   propose a new nomenclature for ATM subtypes that takes into account
   their diversity.}},
