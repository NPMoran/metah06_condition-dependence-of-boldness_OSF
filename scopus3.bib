abstract={In 2012, the World Organisation for Animal Health adopted 10 'General Principles for the Welfare of Animals in Livestock Production Systems' to guide the development of animal welfare standards. The General Principles draw on half a century of scientific research relevant to animal welfare: (1) how genetic selection affects animal health, behaviour and temperament; (2) how the environment influences injuries and the transmission of diseases and parasites; (3) how the environment affects resting, movement and the performance of natural behaviour; (4) the management of groups to minimize conflict and allow positive social contact; (5) the effects of air quality, temperature and humidity on animal health and comfort; (6) ensuring access to feed and water suited to the animals' needs and adaptations; (7) prevention and control of diseases and parasites, with humane euthanasia if treatment is not feasible or recovery is unlikely; (8) prevention and management of pain; (9) creation of positive human-animal relationships; and (10) ensuring adequate skill and knowledge among animal handlers. Research directed at animal welfare, drawing on animal behaviour, stress physiology, veterinary epidemiology and other fields, complements more established fields of animal and veterinary science and helps to create a more comprehensive scientific basis for animal care and management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The typical Western diet, rich in high saturated fat and refined sugar (HFS), has been shown to increase cognitive decline with aging and Alzheimer's disease, and to affect cognitive functions that are dependent on the hippocampus, including memory processes and reversal learning. To investigate neurophysiological changes underlying these impairments, we employed a proteomic approach to identify differentially expressed proteins in the rat dorsal and ventral hippocampus following maintenance on an HFS diet. Rats maintained on the HFS diet for 8 weeks were impaired on a novel object recognition task that assesses memory and on a Morris Water Maze task assessing reversal learning. Quantitative label-free shotgun proteomic analysis was conducted on biological triplicates for each group. For the dorsal hippocampus, 59 proteins were upregulated and 36 downregulated in the HFS group compared to controls. Pathway ana-lysis revealed changes to proteins involved in molecular transport and cellular and molecular signaling, and changes to signaling pathways including calcium signaling, citrate cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. For the ventral hippocampus, 25 proteins were upregulated and 27 downregulated in HFS fed rats. Differentially expressed proteins were involved in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and cellular and molecular function. Changes to signaling pathways included protein ubiquitination, ubiquinone biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This is the first shotgun proteomics study to examine protein changes in the hippocampus following long-term consumption of a HFS diet, identifying changes to a large number of proteins including those involved in synaptic plasticity and energy metabolism. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000028.© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={An effective regulation emotion has been viewed as an important developmental task that serves as a prerequisite for several other developmental tasks. Specifically, because unregulated emotions have the potential to disorganize and disrupt multiple psychological processes. Children with deficits in emotion regulation have an increased risk for the development of emotional and behavioral problems. Emotion regulation starts to develop prenatally and is closely connected to early interactions with the infants' caregivers. A few studies show associations between prenatal risk factors (e.g. prenatal stress, maternal mental disorders, toxins, and malnutrition) and the emotional reactivity of the offspring. An increased excitability or irritability of the baby increases the demands on the interpersonal emotion regulation by the parents. However, deficits in the interpersonal emotion regulation in highly irritable infants can have a negative impact on the emotion regulation. Accordingly, a model of prenatal programming and postnatal plasticity of the emotion regulation in infants and toddlers is derived in this review paper, which is based on a mutual influence of pre- and postnatal risks for the development of the child's emotion regulation.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of risk of developing eating disorders in a sample of 767 adolescent girls aged between 16 and 20, and to study the differences between adolescent girls at high risk and low risk of developing eating disorders in relation to different variables (sociodemographic, anthropometric, body image perception, overvaluation of thinness, substance consumption, alexithymia and anxiety). The prevalence of adolescent girls at high risk was found to be 15%. The results revealed that weight, BMI, body image perception and overvaluation of thinness were key factors in adolescent girls at high risk of developing eating disorders. Also, a higher percentage of at high risk adolescent girls smoked, had tried synthetic drugs and started drinking alcohol at a younger age. Higher levels of alexithymia and anxiety were also found in at-risk adolescents. These results suggest that, in addition to nutritional education and information about the effects of internalizing the thin ideal on adolescent personalities, eating disorders prevention programs should also include techniques for expressing and regulating emotions, in order to prevent young girls from turning to inappropriate weight and body image control behaviors. © 2013: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.

abstract={For many animals, the ability to distinguish cues indicative of predation risk from cues unrelated to predation risk is not entirely innate, but rather is learned and improved with experience. Two pathways to such learning are possible. First, an animal could initially express antipredator behaviour toward a wide range of cues and subsequently learn which of those cues are non-threatening. Alternatively, it could initially express no antipredator behaviour toward a wide range of cues and subsequently learn which of them are threatening. While the learned recognition of threatening cues may occur either through personal interaction with a cue (asocial learning) or through observation of the behaviour of social companions toward a cue (social learning), the learned recognition of non-threatening cues seems to occur exclusively through habituation, a form of asocial learning. Here, we tested whether convict cichlid fish (Amatitlania siquia) can socially learn to recognize visual cues in their environment as either threatening or non-threatening. We exposed juvenile convict cichlids simultaneously to a novel visual cue and one of three (visual) social cues: a social cue indicative of non-risk (the sight of conspecifics that had previously been habituated to the novel cue), a social cue indicative of predation risk (the sight of conspecifics trained to fear the novel cue), or a control treatment with no social cue. The subsequent response of focal fish, when presented with the novel cue alone, was not influenced by the social cue that they had previously witnessed. We therefore did not find evidence that convict cichlids in our study could use social learning to recognize novel visual cues as either threatening or non-threatening. We consider alternative explanations for our findings. © 2013 Barks et al.},

abstract={Behavioural strategies to reduce predation risk can incur costs, which are often referred to as risk effects. A common strategy to avoid predation is spatio-temporal avoidance of predators, in which prey typically trade optimal resources for safety. Analogous with predator-prey theory, risk effects should also arise in species with sexually selected infanticide (SSI), in which females with dependent offspring avoid infanticidal males. SSI can be common in brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations and explains spatio-temporal segregation among reproductive classes. Here, we show that in a population with SSI, females with cubs-of-the-year had lower quality diets than conspecifics during the SSI high-risk period, the mating season. After the mating season, their diets were of similar quality to diets of their conspecifics. Our results suggest a nutritive risk effect of SSI, in which females with cubs-of-the-year alter their resource selection and trade optimal resources for offspring safety. Such risk effects can add to female costs of reproduction and may be widespread among species with SSI. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Acute and chronic states of food deprivation result in increased sensitivity to a variety of natural reinforcers as well as to drugs of abuse. Food deprived animals show increased locomotor activity during periods of food deprivation, as well as increased locomotor stimulant responses to drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, and ethanol, implying that drugs of abuse act in part on neural systems that underlie responses towards food. To determine whether this effect extends to an invertebrate, highly genetically tractable animal, the locomotor stimulant effects of low dose ethanol were assessed under a variety of feeding conditions in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Food deprivation resulted in strain specific increases in ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity in most strains tested, although elevated baseline activity confounded interpretation in some strains. Experiments conducted with Canton S flies found that the effects of food deprivation on the locomotor stimulant response to ethanol increased with the duration of deprivation, and could be blocked by refeeding the flies with standard food or sucrose, but not yeast, immediately prior to the ethanol exposure. Life-span extending dietary depletion procedures or previous periods of food deprivation did not affect the response to ethanol, indicating that only animals in an acutely food deprived state are more sensitive to the stimulant effects of ethanol. These results suggest that increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of some drugs of abuse might reflect an evolutionarily conserved neural mechanism that underlies behavioral responses to natural reinforcers and drugs of abuse. The identification of this mechanism, and the genes that underlie its development and function, will constitute a novel approach towards the study of alcohol abuse and dependence. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The exponential growth of the human population and its increasing industrial development often involve large scale modifications of the environment. In the marine context, coastal urbanisation and harbour expansion to accommodate the rising levels of shipping and offshore energy exploitation require dredging to modify the shoreline and sea floor. While the consequences of dredging on invertebrates and fish are relatively well documented, no study has robustly tested the effects on large marine vertebrates. We monitored the attendance of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) to a recently established urbanised foraging patch, Aberdeen harbour (Scotland), and modelled the effect of dredging operations on site usage. We found that higher intensities of dredging caused the dolphins to spend less time in the harbour, despite high baseline levels of disturbance and the importance of the area as a foraging patch. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The foods that tend to be rejected by children include those which may have greatest importance for later health. This paper reviews some of the intrinsic and extrinsic influences on preschool children's eating behavior, with particular reference to their acceptance of new foods into their diet. Factors conceptualized as intrinsic to the child in this review include sensory processing, taste perception, neophobia, and temperament. The important extrinsic determinants of children's food acceptance which are reviewed include parental and peer modeling, the family food environment, infant feeding practices including breastfeeding and age at weaning, concurrent feeding practices including restriction, pressure to eat, prompting and reward, and the taste & energy content of foods. Children's willingness to accept new foods is influenced by a wide range of factors that likely have individual and also interactive effects on children's willingness to taste, and then continue to eat, new foods. The literature lacks longitudinal and experimental studies, which will be particularly important in determining interventions most likely to be effective in facilitating children's acceptance of healthy foods. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Drug use typically begins during adolescence, which is a period of ongoing neurobiological development that may confer heightened vulnerability to develop drug dependence. Previously, our lab has shown that amphetamine (AMPH)-induced deficits in a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-sensitive working memory task are greater in rats exposed to the drug during adolescence compared to adulthood. Here, we examine potential age-dependent effects of AMPH exposure on behavioral flexibility tasks that are sensitive to disruptions in mPFC and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected (i.p.) with saline or 3. mg/kg AMPH every other day between postnatal days (PNDs) 27-45 and PNDs 85-103. Starting around PND 125, rats were tested in an attentional set-shifting task and a subset of those was then tested in an operant strategy shifting task. Following completion of the operant task, rats were challenged with 3. mg/kg AMPH and monitored in open field chambers. Our results demonstrate that AMPH-exposed rats were faster to acquire simple and compound discriminations, but were impaired during the first stimulus-reward reversal when compared to controls. In the operant strategy shifting task, adolescent-exposed rats shifted more rapidly between strategies and completed reversals faster than adult-exposed and control rats, respectively. The final AMPH challenge revealed evidence for sensitization in drug pre-exposed rats, with adult-exposed animals exhibiting the most significant effects. Together, these results suggest that AMPH induces long-lasting changes in behavioral flexibility that are at least partially dependent on age of exposure and may be due to adaptations in OFC function. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Animals depend on reliable sensory information for accurate behavioural decisions. For herbivorous insects it is crucial to find host plants for feeding and reproduction, and these insects must be able to differentiate suitable from unsuitable plants. Volatiles are important cues for insect herbivores to assess host plant quality. It has previously been shown that female moths of the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), avoid oviposition on damaged cotton Gossypium hirsutum, which may mediated by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Among the HIPVs, some volatiles are released following any type of damage while others are synthesized de novo and released by the plants only in response to herbivore damage. In behavioural experiments we here show that oviposition by S. littoralis on undamaged cotton plants was reduced by adding volatiles collected from plants with ongoing herbivory. Gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) recordings revealed that antennae of mated S. littoralis females responded to 18 compounds from a collection of headspace volatiles of damaged cotton plants. Among these compounds, a blend of the seven de novo synthesized volatile compounds was found to reduce oviposition in S. littoralis on undamaged plants under both laboratory and ambient (field) conditions in Egypt. Volatile compounds that are not produced de novo by the plants did not affect oviposition. Our results show that ovipositing females respond specifically to the de novo synthesized volatiles released from plants under herbivore attack. We suggest that these volatiles provide reliable cues for ovipositing females to detect plants that could provide reduced quality food for their offspring and an increased risk of competition and predation. © 2013.

abstract={The predator satiation hypothesis is one plausible explanation for masting in lowland dipterocarp forests in SE Asia. Hence, evaluation of behavioral patterns of seed predators have the potential to provide support for the predator satiation hypothesis. In order to evaluate possible mechanisms that could result in predator satiation, we studied the functional response in the seed predation behavior to fruiting seasonality of red leaf monkeys (Presbytis rubicunda Müller, 1838, Colobinae) in Danum Valley, Sabah, northern Borneo. Specifically, we sought to answer the two questions: (1) when fruit availability increases, to what extent do red leaf monkeys increase their seed eating? and (2) do red leaf monkeys change the degree to which they pursue one species of seeds in response to the changes in community-level fruit availability? In response to the increased fruit availability, red leaf monkeys extended their time spent feeding on seeds as much as 18 fold. This large functional response resulted from the elongated total feeding time and the preference for seeds by red leaf monkeys. Feeding time tended to increase, up to 28% of the observation time, with increasing fruit availability. In response to increased fruiting seasonality, the monkeys increased the number of species and plant individuals upon whose seeds they depredated. Time spent feeding on seeds per species or individual, or for the most frequently eaten species or individual, was not affected by fruit availability. Similarly, the duration of one seed-feeding event was unaffected by the fruit availability. Hence, while our results demonstrate a functional response to mast fruiting, we found no support for the predator satiation hypothesis. The existence of an abundant alternative resource (young leaves) is one of several likely reasons for the weak persistence toward seeds shown by red leaf monkeys, which is contradictory to the assumption of the predator satiation hypothesis. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

abstract={Objective: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and severe, sometimes life-threatening, psychiatric disorder with high relapse rates under standard treatment. After decades of brain-lesioning procedures offered as a last resort, deep-brain stimulation (DBS) has come under investigation in the last few years as a treatment option for severe and refractory AN. Methods and Results: In this jointly written article, Sun et al. (the Shanghai group) report an average of 65% increase in body weight in four severe and refractory patients with AN after they underwent the DBS procedure (average follow-up: 38 months). All patients weighed greater than 85% of expected body weight and thus no longer met the diagnostic criteria of AN at last follow-up. Nuttin et al. (the Leuven group) describe other clinical studies that provide evidence for the use of DBS for AN and further discuss patient selection criteria, target selection, and adverse event of this evolving therapy. Conclusion: Preliminary results from the Shanghai group and other clinical centers showed that the use of DBS to treat AN may be a valuable option for weight restoration in otherwise-refractory and life-threatening cases. The nature of this procedure, however, remains investigational and should not be viewed as a standard clinical treatment option. Further scientific investigation is essential to warrant the long-term efficacy and safety of DBS for AN. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tail biting has several identified feeding-related risk factors. Tail biters are often said to be lighter and thinner than other pigs in the pen, possibly because of nutrition-related problems such as reduced feed intake or inability to use nutrients efficiently. This can lead to an increase in foraging behavior and tail biting. In this study, a total of 55 pigs of different ages were selected according to their tail-biting behavior (bouts/hour) and pen-feeding system to form eight experimental groups: tail-biting pigs (TB), victim pigs (V) and control pigs from a tail-biting pen (Ctb) and control pen (Cno) having either free access to feed with limited feeding space or meal feeding from a long trough. After euthanasia, a segment of jejunal cell wall was cut from 50 cm (S50) and 100 cm (S100) posterior to the bile duct. Villus height, crypt depth and villus : crypt ratio (V : C) were measured morphometrically. Blood serum concentration of minerals and plasma concentration of amino acids (AA) was determined. Villus height was greater in Cno than Ctb pigs in the proximal and mid-jejunum (P < 0.05), indicative of better ability to absorb nutrients, and increased with age in the proximal jejunum (P < 0.001). Serum mineral concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and calcium (Ca) was lower in Ctb compared with Cno pigs, and that of Pi in V compared with all the other pigs. Many non-essential AA were lower in pigs from tail-biting pens, and particularly in victim pigs. Free access feeding with shared feeding space was associated with lower levels of essential AA in blood than meal feeding with simultaneous feeding space. Our data suggest that being a pig in a tail-biting pen is associated with decreased jejunal villus height and blood AA levels, possibly because of depressed absorption capacity, feeding behavior or environmental stress associated with tail biting. Victim pigs had lower concentrations of AA and Pi in plasma, possibly as a consequence of being bitten. © 2013 The Animal Consortium.},

abstract={A relationship between orosensory detection of dietary lipids, regulation of fat intake, and body mass index was recently suggested. However, involved mechanisms are poorly understood. Moreover, whether obesity can directly modulate preference for fatty foods remains unknown. To address this question, exploration of the oral lipid sensing system was undertaken in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. By using a combination of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral approaches, we found that i ) the attraction for lipids is decreased in obese mice, ii ) this behavioral change has an orosensory origin, iii ) it is reversed in calorierestricted DIO mice, revealing an inverse correlation between fat preference and adipose tissue size, iv ) obesity suppresses the lipid-mediated downregulation of the lipidsensor CD36 in circumvallate papillae, usually found during the refeeding of lean mice, and v ) the CD36-dependent signaling cascade controlling the intracellular calcium levels ([Ca 2+]i) in taste bud cells is decreased in obese mice. Therefore, obesity alters the lipid-sensing system responsible for the oral perception of dietary lipids. This phenomenon seems to take place through a CD36-mediated mechanism, leading to changes in eating behavior. Copyright © 2013 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a plant widely used for food consumption in different processed products in rural areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Cassava is a good source of carbohydrates and micronutrients. However, if it is not adequately processed or the consumer has nutritional deficiencies, then its cyanogenic glycoside (i.e., linamarin and lotaustralin) content makes it potentially neurotoxic. In the present study, the neurotoxic effects of different concentrations of linamarin (0.075, 0.15, 0.22, and 0.30. mg/kg) contained in cassava juice were evaluated in the open field and swim tests to identify locomotor alterations in adult male Wistar rats. The linamarin concentration in cassava juice was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the juice was administered intraesophageally for 28. days. The results suggested that the consumption of linamarin in cassava juice increased the number of crossings and rearings in the open field test and caused behavioral deficiency, reflected by lateral swimming, in the swim test on days 21 and 28 of treatment. These alterations are possibly related to neuronal damage caused by linamarin in cassava juice in structures of the central nervous system involved in motor processing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Incidence rates of cognitive impairment and dementia are rising with the ageing population. Meanwhile, the limited success of current treatments has led to a search for early markers of dementia which could predict future progression or improve quality of life for those already suffering from the disease. One focus has been on the correlation between physical and cognitive measures with an increasing interest in the association between frailty and cognitive decline. Frailty is an age-related syndrome described as the decreased ability of an organism to respond to stressors. A number of epidemiological studies have reported that frailty increases the risk of future cognitive decline and that cognitive impairment increases the risk of frailty suggesting that cognition and frailty interact within a cycle of decline associated with ageing. This paper reviews the evidence for an association between frailty and cognitive impairment and outlines some of the mechanisms that potentially underpin this relationship from brain neuropathology and hormonal dysregulation to cardiovascular risk and psychological factors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Violence is increasingly viewed as a public health issue that may be ameliorated by health-based interventions. The Healthy Brains and Behavior Study (HBBS) aims to identify environmental and biological risk factors for aggression in late childhood and to reduce aggression through psychological and nutritional treatments. Utilizing a cross-disciplinary collaborative research approach, the HBBS has both human and animal components. The human component has two stages consisting of risk assessment followed by treatment. The risk assessment is based on 451 community-residing children aged 11-12years and their caregivers, during which genetic, brain imaging, neuroendocrine, psychophysiology, environment toxicology, neurocognitive, nutrition, psychological, social and demographic risk variables are collected. Children who met criteria (N=219) for problematic aggressive behaviors were assigned to one of four treatment groups: cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) alone, nutritional supplements alone, both CBT and nutrition, or treatment-as-usual. Treatment duration was 12weeks and all children whether in treatment or not were followed-up at three, six, and 12months. The animal component assessed the effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids on the development of aggression. This study contributes knowledge on how biological factors interact with social factors in shaping proactive and reactive aggression and assesses the efficacy of treatment approaches to reduce childhood aggression. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Clinical and nonclinical safety liabilities remain a major cause of adverse drug reactions, candidate drug attrition, delays during development, labelling restrictions, non-approval, and product withdrawal. Many of the toxicities are functional in nature and/or in origin. Whereas pharmacological responses tend to be fairly rapid in onset, and are therefore detectable after a single dose, some diminish on repeated dosing, whereas others increase in magnitude and therefore can be missed or underestimated in single-dose safety pharmacology studies. Functional measurements can be incorporated into repeat-dose toxicity studies, either routinely or on an ad hoc basis. Drivers for this are both scientific (see above), and regulatory (e.g., ICH S6, S7, S9). There are inherent challenges in achieving this: the availability of suitable technical and scientific expertise in the test facility; unsuitable laboratory conditions; use of simultaneous (as opposed to staggered) dosing; requirement for toxicokinetic sampling; unsuitability of certain techniques (e.g., use of anaesthesia; surgical implantation; food restriction); equipment availability at close proximity; sensitivity of the methods to detect small, clinically relevant, changes. Nonetheless, 'fit-for-purpose' data can still be acquired without requiring additional animals. Examples include assessment of behaviour, sensorimotor, visual, and autonomic functions, ambulatory ECG and blood pressure, echocardiography, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic functions. This is entirely achievable if functional measurements are relatively unobtrusive, both with respect to the animals and to the toxicology study itself. Careful pharmacological validation of any methods used, and establishing their detection sensitivity, is vital to ensure the credibility of generated data. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Stress increases the risk of drug abuse, causes relapse to drug seeking, and potentiates the rewarding properties of both nicotine and cocaine. Understanding the mechanisms by which stress regulates the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse provides valuable insight into potential treatments for drug abuse. Prior reports have demonstrated that stress causes dynorphin release, activating kappa opioid receptors (KOR) in monoamine circuits resulting in both potentiation and reinstatement of cocaine and nicotine conditioned place preference. Here we report that kappa opioid-dependent reinstatement of cocaine and nicotine place preference is reduced when the mice are exposed to a randomized chronic mild stress (CMS) regime prior to training in a conditioned place preference-reinstatement paradigm. The CMS schedule involves seven different stressors (removal of nesting for 24 h, 5 min forced swim stress at 15°C, 8 h food and water deprivation, damp bedding overnight, white noise, cage tilt, and disrupted home cage lighting) rotated over a 3-week period. This response is KOR-selective, as CMS does not protect against cocaine or nicotine drug-primed reinstatement. This protection from reinstatement is also observed following sub-chronic social defeat stress, where each mouse is placed in an aggressor mouse home cage for a period of 20 min over 5 days. In contrast, a single acute stressor resulted in a potentiation of KOR-induced reinstatement, as previously reported. Prior studies have shown that stress alters sensitivity to opioids and prior stress can influence the pharmacodynamics of the opioid receptor system. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to different forms of stress may cause a dysregulation of kappa opioid circuitry and that changes resulting from mild stress can have protective and adaptive effects against drug relapse. © 2013 Al-Hasani, McCall and Bruchas.},

abstract={Background Pregnancy is a time in which food choice is of particular importance. Trust in the food supply and those who regulate it is receiving greater acknowledgement because of the influence of trust on food choice. No prior investigation into pregnant women and food trust has been conducted. Aims This paper identifies factors that determine the nature and extent of pregnant women's trust in food; sources of information which influence pregnant women's food choices; and how trust impacts on pregnant women's food choices. Method In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 pregnant women; nine were pregnant with their first child and four were in their second or subsequent pregnancy. Results Food choices of pregnant women were predominantly influenced by nutrition and perceived quality of food. Risktaking behaviour, such as the consumption of foods considered high risk during pregnancy, was common amongst participants. The sample was characterised by a dependence on expert information, limited reflexivity in relation to food safety, and contradictory practice such as risk-taking behaviours in regard to high risk foods were observed. Conclusion Further research is needed to confirm findings in this study. Research into consumption of high-risk foods and the information received from healthcare providers would be useful in creating a clearer understanding of whether provision of information is sufficient in communicating risks and promoting a healthy pregnancy.},

abstract={Prolonged exposure to stress during development can have long-term detrimental effects on health and wellbeing. However, the environmental matching hypothesis proposes that developmental stress programs physiology and behaviour in an adaptive way that can enhance fitness if early environments match those experienced later in life. Most research has focused on the harmful effects that stress during a single period in early life may exert in adulthood. In this study, we tested the potential additive and beneficial effects that stress experienced during both pre- and post-hatching development may have on adult physiology and behaviour. Japanese quail experienced different stress-related treatments across two developmental life stages: pre-hatching corticosterone (CORT) injection, post-hatching unpredictable food availability, both pre- and post-hatching treatments, or control. In adulthood, we determined quails' acute stress response, neophobia and novel environment exploration. The pre-hatching CORT treatment resulted in attenuated physiological responses to an acute stressor, increased activity levels and exploration in a novel environment. Post-hatching unpredictable food availability decreased adults' latency to feed. Furthermore, there were cumulative effects of these treatments across the two developmental stages: quail subjected to both pre- and post-hatching treatments were the most explorative and risk-taking of all treatment groups. Such responses to novel environments could enhance survival in unpredictable environments in later life. Our data also suggest that these behavioural responses may have been mediated by long-term physiological programming of the adrenocortical stress response, creating phenotypes that could exhibit fitness-enhancing behaviours in a changing environment. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Predators often show strong plasticity of optimal foraging strategies. A major difference in foraging strategies occurs between sit-and-wait and active predators. Models predict that the efficiency of these strategies is affected by environmental conditions, active predators being favoured when prey are scarce and their detection difficult. The shift between the two strategies may occur through both phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, are typically stream-dwelling sit-and-wait predators, but some populations breed in caves. We evaluated whether local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity determine shifts in foraging strategy between stream and cave populations. The foraging behaviour of salamander larvae was evaluated under all combinations of three test conditions during trials: light versus darkness, prey presence versus absence and food deprived versus fed; larvae originated from caves and streams and were reared in epigeous photoperiod or in darkness. Observations and video tracking showed that salamander larvae modified their behaviour in response to environmental conditions. In the darkness, larvae showed higher average velocity and moved longer distances. Movements were higher in food-deprived larvae and in the presence of prey compared to fed larvae and prey absent conditions. Furthermore, larvae from cave populations showed higher behavioural plasticity than stream larvae, and better exploited the available space in test environments. Variation in foraging behaviour was strong, and involved complex interactions between plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae from cave populations showed higher behavioural plasticity, supporting the hypothesis that this trait may be important for the exploitation of novel environments, such as caves. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Control operations for invasive ship rats, Rattus rattus, in New Zealand forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus, detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further research is required to determine whether the results of our captive experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Contrary to previous results, GT lesions did not eliminate drug-induced CTAs. Rather, GT-lesioned rats acquired aversions of comparable magnitude to non-lesioned subjects but from an elevated intake on the first conditioning trial. A similar pattern of lesion effects was found in the acquisition of an illness-induced CTA. Thus, we conclude that GT lesions do not differentially influence CTAs conditioned with drugs or toxins.

abstract={Perfectionism is associated with several mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. The goal of this study was to test the specificity of the associations between perfectionism facets and eating disorder behaviors, by examining whether neuroticism and conscientiousness mediated or moderated associations between these variables. Participants from a representative community sample (N=407; 47% female) completed questionnaires assessing perfectionism, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and eating disorder behaviors. Neuroticism partially mediated associations between binge eating, restraint, body dissatisfaction, and maladaptive perfectionism facets. Neuroticism did not mediate associations between restriction and achievement striving perfectionism facets. Conscientiousness did not mediate any associations between perfectionism facets and eating disorder behaviors, yet Doubts about Actions interacted with conscientiousness to predict body dissatisfaction. Results indicate that neuroticism is key for understanding general risk factors that lead to myriad internalizing disorders, whereas maladaptive perfectionism has limited usefulness as a specific risk factor for eating disorder behaviors. Nevertheless, there is a unique association between dietary restraint and achievement striving dimensions of perfectionism that cannot be explained by higher-order personality traits. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) is expressed primarily on cells involved in inflammation and immune responses. Recently, it has been reported the functional expression of H4R within neurons of the central nervous system, but their role has been poorly understood. The present study aimed to elucidate the physiopathological role of cerebral H4R in animal models by the intracerebroventricular administration of the H4R agonist VUF 8430 (20-40 μg per mouse). Selectivity of results was confirmed by the prevention of the effects produced by the H4R antagonist JNJ 10191584 (3-9 mg/kg p.o.). Neuronal H4R activation induced acute thermal antinociception, indicating that neuronal histamine H4R might be involved in the production of antinociception in the absence of an inflammatory process. An anxiolytic-like effect of intensity comparable to that exerted by diazepam, used as reference drug, was produced in the light-dark box test. VUF 8430 reversed the scopolamine-induced amnesia in the passive avoidance test and showed anorexant activity in food deprived mice. Conversely, the H4R activation did not modify the immobility time in the tail suspension test. Rotarod performance test was employed to demonstrate that the effects observed following the administration of VUF 8430 and JNJ 10191584 were not due to impaired motor function of animals. Furthermore, both compounds did not alter spontaneous mobility and exploratory activity in the hole board test. These results show the antinociceptive, antiamnesic, anxiolytic and anorexant effects induced by neuronal H4R agonism, suggesting that H4 modulators may have broader utility further the control of inflammatory and immune processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={How foragers balance risks during foraging is a central focus of optimal foraging studies. While diverse theoretical and empirical work has revealed how foragers should and do manage food and safety from predators, little attention has been given to the risks posed by dangerous prey. This is a potentially important oversight because risk of injury can give rise to foraging costs similar to those arising from the risk of predation, and with similar consequences. Here, we synthesize the literature on how foragers manage risks associated with dangerous prey and adapt previous theory to make the first steps towards a framework for future studies. Though rarely documented, it appears that in some systems predators are frequently injured while hunting and risk of injury can be an important foraging cost. Fitness costs of foraging injuries, which can be fatal, likely vary widely but have rarely been studied and should be the subject of future research. Like other types of risk-taking behaviour, it appears that there is individual variation in the willingness to take risks, which can be driven by social factors, experience and foraging abilities, or differences in body condition. Because of ongoing modifications to natural communities, including changes in prey availability and relative abundance as well as the introduction of potentially dangerous prey to numerous ecosystems, understanding the prevalence and consequences of hunting dangerous prey should be a priority for behavioural ecologists. © 2013 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract={Foraging behaviour (grazing time, diet selection) and overlap in vegetation use between five beef cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 does, suckling their offspring born in late winter-early spring, was compared across the grazing season (May-December). Animals were managed in mixed grazing on heather-gorse vegetation communities with an adjacent area (24%) of ryegrass-clover improved pasture. Equines spent more daily time grazing than the other species in all seasons, averaging 610. min/day compared to 530, 481 and 496. min/day spent by cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. Seasonal changes in both grazing behaviour and diet selection were observed. Generally, cows, mares and ewes spent most of their grazing time on the improved pasture (0.77, 0.73 and 0.59, respectively), whereas goats spent more time grazing on shrublands (0.70). All species concentrated their diurnal grazing activity in the morning and late afternoon, whilst resting occurred mainly in the middle of the day. Herbaceous species were the main component in the diets of cattle, equines and sheep across the whole grazing season, whereas for goats this predominance was only observed during the spring. Cattle, sheep and equines turned to browse only when pasture availability decreased. Cattle and sheep tended to select heather in moderate amounts whereas they avoided gorse across the grazing season. By contrast, horses seemed to be able to deal with the gorse spiny shoots and consumed it in the autumn (averaging 0.29). The goats' diet at the end of the grazing season was mainly composed of heather species, reaching 0.81 in November. Degree of grazing overlap between livestock species was influenced by the animal species and also varied across the grazing season. The greatest similarity indexes (KSI) based on grazing time and diet composition data were found between cattle and equines (0.86) and between cattle and sheep (0.94), whereas the combination of goats with the other animal species resulted in lower KSI values. Dietary overlap decreased as the improved pasture availability decreased during the grazing season. Results suggest that the success of management strategies (type and composition of the flock, mixed or sequential, continuous or seasonal) in these heterogeneous vegetation conditions will depend on plant species characteristics and its proportions. Grazing management options should be based on production (animal performance) or environmental goals (biodiversity, control of shrub encroachment, reduction of fire risk, etc.) previously defined. Goats proved to be the best complement to the other animal species for an efficient use of natural vegetation. Nevertheless, studies should be carried out to assess the interactions between grazing behaviour and animal performance in these particular vegetation conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is well established that early-life nutritional alterations lead to increased risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in adult life. Although it is clear that obesity gives rise to chronic low-grade inflammation, there is little evidence regarding the role of inflammation in the adipose tissue of undernourished (UN) offspring. GH reduces fat mass and has antiinflammatory properties. The present study examined the effect of maternal UN on adipose inflammation in adult offspring and whether GH treatment during a critical period of developmental plasticity could ameliorate metabolic dysfunction associated with a poor start to life. Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to chow (C) or UN (50% ad libitum; UN) diet throughout gestation. Male C and UN pups received saline (control saline [CS]/UN) or GH (2.5βg/g/d; control growth hormone [CGH]/undernourished growth hormone [UNGH]) from days 3-21. Postweaning males were further randomized and fed either chow or high-fat diet until day 160. An ex vivo glucose uptake assay demonstrated adipose tissue from UN offspring displayed attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake compared with CS, CGH, and UNGH. This was associated with increased insulin receptor, glucose transporter 4, and insulin receptor substrate 1 gene expression. Furthermore, UN demonstrated enhanced TNF- and IL-1 secretion from adipose explants and stromal vascular fraction cultures accompanied by increased adipose tissue gene expression of several key proinflammatory genes and markers of macrophage infiltration. Overall,UNoffspring displayed a more potent immunophenotype, which correlated with decreased insulin sensitivity. Preweaning GH treatment negates these detrimental effects, indicating the potential for reversing metabolic dysfunction in UN adult offspring. © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.},

abstract={Body size at metamorphosis is a key trait in species (such as many anurans) with biphasic life-histories. Experimental studies have shown that metamorph size is highly plastic, depending upon larval density and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, food supply, water quality, chemical cues from conspecifics, predators and competitors). To test the hypothesis that this developmental plasticity is adaptive, or to determine if inducing plasticity can be used to control an invasive species, we need to know whether or not a metamorphosing anuran's body size influences its subsequent viability. For logistical reasons, there are few data on this topic under field conditions. We studied cane toads (Rhinella marina) within their invasive Australian range. Metamorph body size is highly plastic in this species, and our laboratory studies showed that larger metamorphs had better locomotor performance (both on land and in the water), and were more adept at catching and consuming prey. In mark-recapture trials in outdoor enclosures, larger body size enhanced metamorph survival and growth rate under some seasonal conditions. Larger metamorphs maintained their size advantage over smaller siblings for at least a month. Our data support the critical but rarely-tested assumption that all else being equal, larger body size at metamorphosis is likely to enhance an individual's long term viability. Thus, manipulations to reduce body size at metamorphosis in cane toads may help to reduce the ecological impact of this invasive species. © 2013 Cabrera Guzman et al.},

The regularity axiom of utility theory holds that a preference between options should be maintained when other options are made available. Empirical studies have shown that animals violate regularity but this has not been understood from a theoretical perspective, such decisions have therefore been labelled as irrational. Here, I use models of state-dependent behaviour to demonstrate that choices can violate regularity even when behavioural strategies are optimal. I also show that the range of conditions over which regularity should be violated can be larger when options do not always persist into the future. Consequently, utility theory-based on axioms, including transitivity, regularity and the independence of irrelevant alternatives-is undermined, because even alternatives that are never chosen by an animal (in its current state) can be relevant to a decision. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Nutrition is crucial to the initial development of the central nervous system, and then to its maintenance, because both depend on dietary intake to supply the elements required to develop and fuel the system. Diet in early life is often seen in the context of "programming" where a stimulus occurring during a vulnerable period can have long-lasting or even lifetime effects on some aspect of the organism's structure or function. Nutrition was first shown to be a programing stimulus for growth, and then for cognitive behaviour, in animal studies that were able to employ methods that allowed the demonstration of neural effects of early nutrition. Such research raised the question of whether nutrition could also programme cognition/brain structure in humans. Initial studies of cognitive effects were observational, usually conducted in developing countries where the presence of confounding factors made it difficult to interpret the role of nutrition in the cognitive deficits that were seen. Attributing causality to nutrition required randomised controlled trials and these, often in developed countries, started to appear around 30 years ago. Most demonstrated convincingly that early nutrition could affect subsequent cognition. Until the advent of neuroimaging techniques that allowed in vivo examination of the brain, however, we could determine very little about the neural effects of early diet in humans. The combination of well-designed trials with neuroimaging tools means that we are now able to pose and answer questions that would have seemed impossible only recently. This review discusses various neuroimaging methods that are suitable for use in nutrition studies, while pointing out some of the limitations that they may have. The existing literature is small, but examples of studies that have used these methods are presented. Finally, some considerations that have arisen from previous studies, as well as suggestions for future research, are discussed. © 2013 Isaacs.},

abstract={In winter, foraging activity is intended to optimize food search while minimizing both thermoregulation costs and predation risk. Here we quantify the relative importance of thermoregulation and predation in foraging patch selection of woodland birds wintering in a Mediterranean montane forest. Specifically, we account for thermoregulation benefits related to temperature, and predation risk associated with both illumination of the feeding patch and distance to the nearest refuge provided by vegetation. We measured the amount of time that 38 marked individual birds belonging to five small passerine species spent foraging at artificial feeders. Feeders were located in forest patches that vary in distance to protective cover and exposure to sun radiation; temperature and illumination were registered locally by data loggers. Our results support the influence of both thermoregulation benefits and predation costs on feeding patch choice. The influence of distance to refuge (negative relationship) was nearly three times higher than that of temperature (positive relationship) in determining total foraging time spent at a patch. Light intensity had a negligible and no significant effect. This pattern was generalizable among species and individuals within species, and highlights the preponderance of latent predation risk over thermoregulation benefits on foraging decisions of birds wintering in temperate Mediterranean forests. © 2013 Villén-Pérez et al.},

abstract={Annual changes in the behaviour and distribution of top predators at sea may be linked to environmental variability. Here we report, for the first time to our knowledge, the interannual (2007-2011) foraging ecology during the pre-laying period of female Cory's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea from Berlenga (Portugal), based on biotelemetry data. Our aim was to examine the degree of flexibility in the at-sea distribution, behaviour and habitat selection of foraging birds, and relate this with marine environmental stochasticity. Productivity proxies in the closer foraging areas decreased noticeably between 2007 and 2011 (i.e. an increase of sea surface temperature and a decrease of primary productivity). Female Cory's shearwaters perceived the oceanic changes, and shifted their distribution to an area that could have the food resources required for egg formation. In 2011, in order to exploit the productive Grand Banks and Newfoundland Shelf domains, female Cory's shearwaters embarked on one of the largest foraging excursions of the prelaying period when compared to other seabird species (nearly 4000 km). The option to forage on such a distant area in 2011 decreased the females' body condition and reduced their hatching success, which may be interpreted as an adaptation to local productivity during this energetically highly demanding period to favour their own survival. Long-term monitoring of the foraging behaviour of top predators such as Cory's shearwaters in years to come may serve as a 'sensitive' proxy to help understand the medium- to long-term effects of environmental stochasticity in marine ecological systems. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={Drosophila melanogaster can taste various compounds and separate them into few basic categories such as sweet, bitter and salt taste. Here we investigate mechanisms underlying acid detection in Drosophila and report that the fly displays strong taste aversion to common carboxylic acids. We find that acid tastants act by the activation of a subset of bitter neurons and inhibition of sweet neurons. Bitter neurons begin to respond at pH 5 and show an increase in spike frequency as the extracellular pH drops, which does not rely on previously identified chemoreceptors. Notably, sweet neuron activity depends on the balance of sugar and acid tastant concentrations. This is independent of bitter neuron firing, and allows the fly to avoid acid-laced food sources even in the absence of functional bitter neurons. The two mechanisms may allow the fly to better evaluate the risk of ingesting acidic foods and modulate its feeding decisions accordingly. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Management of cardiovascular risk factors includes commitment from patients to adhere to prescribed medications and adopt healthy lifestyles. Unfortunately many fail to take up and maintain the four key healthy behaviours (not smoking, having a balanced diet, limiting alcohol consumption and being more active). Five factors (beliefs, knowledge, transport and other costs, emotions, and friends and family support) are known to predict uptake of lifestyle behaviour change. The key factors influencing maintenance of healthy lifestyles are not known but would be helpful to support the development of relapse prevention programmes for this population. Our review aimed to clarify the main patient perceived factors thought to influence maintenance of changed healthy lifestyles.Methods: We performed a systematic review of qualitative observational studies and applied the principles of content synthesis and thematic analysis to extract reported factors (barriers and facilitators) considered by individuals to be influential in maintaining changed healthy lifestyle behaviours. Factors were then organised into an existing framework of higher order categories which was followed by an analysis of the interrelationships between factors to identify key themes.Results: Twenty two studies met our inclusion criteria. Participants reported barriers and facilitators within 13 categories, the majority of which were facilitators. The most commonly reported influences were those relating to social support (whether provided formally or informally), beliefs (about the self or the causes and management of poor health, and the value of maintaining lifestyle behaviours), and other psychological factors (including attitude, thinking and coping styles, and problem solving skills). Physical activity was the most commonly investigated behaviour in four categories, but overall, the main barriers and facilitators were related to a range of behaviours. Through analysis of the interrelationships between factors within categories, 'social support', 'education and knowledge', and 'beliefs and emotions' were all considered key themes.Conclusions: Our review suggests that for the most part, factors that influence lifestyle change are also important for maintaining healthy behaviours. This indicates that addressing these barriers and facilitators within lifestyle support programmes would also be of value in the longer-term. © 2013 Murray et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Collective behavior in the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) meets the thermal constraints of being an early spring folivore, but introduces other constraints in food choice. These are minimized by state-dependent, inter-individual, and ontogenetic variations in responses to social cues. Forest tent caterpillars use pheromone trails and tactile communication among colony members to stay together during foraging. At the group level, these rules lead to cohesive synchronized collective nomadic foraging, in which the colony travels en masse between feeding and resting sites. This paper proposes that synchronized collective locomotion prevents individuals from becoming separated from the colony and hence permits them to reap the advantages of group-living, notably collective basking to increase their body temperature above ambient and collective defense against natural enemies. However, this cohesive behavior also implies conservative foraging, and colonies can become trapped on poor food sources. High fidelity to pheromone trails leads to strong amplification of an initial choice, such that colonies seldom abandon the first food source contacted, even if a better one is nearby. The risk of this trapping is modulated both by consistent inter-individual variations in exploratory behavior and by inner state. Colonies consisting of active-phenotype or protein-deprived individuals that explore more-off trails exhibit greater collective flexibility in foraging. An ontogenetic shift toward more independent movement occurs as caterpillars grow. This leads to colony break-up as the season advances. Selection pressures facing older caterpillars favor solitary living more than in the earlier instars. Caterpillars respond to this predictably changing environment by altering their behavioral rules as they grow. © 2013 Despland.},

abstract={Social groups balance flexibility and robustness in their collective response to environmental changes using feedback between behavioural processes that operate at different timescales. Here we examine how behavioural processes operating at two timescales regulate the foraging activity of colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, allowing them to balance their response to food availability and predation. Previous work showed that the rate at which foragers return to the nest with food influences the rate at which foragers leave the nest. To investigate how interactions inside the nest link the rates of returning and outgoing foragers, we observed outgoing foragers inside the nest in field colonies using a novel observation method. We found that the interaction rate experienced by outgoing foragers inside the nest corresponded to forager return rate, and that the interactions of outgoing foragers were spatially clustered. Activation of a forager occurred on the timescale of seconds: a forager left the nest 3-8. s after a substantial increase in interactions with returning foragers. The availability of outgoing foragers to become activated was adjusted on the timescale of minutes: when forager return was interrupted for more than 4-5. min, available foragers waiting near the nest entrance went deeper into the nest. Thus, forager activation and forager availability both increased with the rate at which foragers returned to the nest. This process was checked by negative feedback between forager activation and forager availability. Regulation of foraging activation on the timescale of seconds provides flexibility in response to fluctuations in food abundance, whereas regulation of forager availability on the timescale of minutes provides robustness in response to sustained disturbance such as predation. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={We discuss the importance of selected natural abiotic and biotic factors in ecological risk assessment based on simplistic laboratory bioassays. Although it is impossible to include all possible natural factors in standard lower-tier ecotoxicological testing, neglecting them is not an option. Therefore, we try to identify the most important factors and advocate redesigning standard testing procedures to include theoretically most potent interactions. We also point out a few potentially important factors that have not been studied enough so far. The available data allowed us to identify temperature and O2 depletion as the most critical factors that should be included in ecotoxicity testing as soon as possible. Temporal limitations and fluctuations in food availability also appear important, but at this point more fundamental research in this area is necessary before making decisions on their inclusion in risk assessment procedures. We propose using specific experimental designs, such as Box-Behnken or Central Composite, which allow for simultaneous testing of 3 or more factors for their individual and interactive effects with greater precision and without increasing the effort and costs of tests dramatically. Factorial design can lead to more powerful tests and help to extend the validity of conclusions. Finally, ecological risk assessment procedures should include information on animal behavior, especially feeding patterns. This requires more basic studies, but already at this point adequate mechanistic effect models can be developed for some species. Copyright © 2013 SETAC.},

abstract={Stress in adolescence has been widely demonstrated to have a lasting impact in humans and animal models. Developmental risk and protective factors play an important role in the responses to stress in adulthood. Mild-to-moderate stress in adolescence may resist the negative impacts of adverse events in adulthood. However, little research on resilience has been conducted. In this study, we used a predictable chronic mild stress (PCMS) procedure (5 min of daily restraint stress for 28 days) in adolescent rats (postnatal days (PNDs) 28-55) to test the resilience effect of PCMS on depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test and anxiety-like behavior in the novelty-suppressed feeding test and elevated plus maze in adulthood. We also investigated the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the brain during the PCMS procedure in adolescence. Moreover, we investigated the effect of PCMS in adolescence on subsequent responses to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS; PNDs 63-83) in adulthood. The results demonstrated that PCMS during adolescence produced antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects and increased mTOR signaling activity in the prefrontal cortex in early adulthood. Either systemic administration or intra-PFC infusion of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin completely blocked the behavioral effects produced by PCMS in adolescence. PCMS during adolescence resisted depressive- and anxiety-like behavior caused by CUS in adulthood. These findings indicate that PCMS in adolescence can contribute to resilience against depression and anxiety caused by stress in adulthood. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

abstract={The balance between the costs and benefits of conspicuous animal communication signals ensures that signal expression relates to the quality of the bearer. Signal plasticity enables males to enhance conspicuous signals to impress mates and competitors and to reduce signal expression to lower energetic and predation-related signaling costs when competition is low. While signal plasticity may benefit the signaler, it can compromise the reliability of the information conveyed by the signals. In this paper we review the effect of signal plasticity on the reliability of the electrocommunication signal of the gymnotiform fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio. We (1) summarize the endocrine regulation of signal plasticity, (2) explore the regulation of signal plasticity in females, (3) examine the information conveyed by the signal, (4) show how that information changes when the signal changes, and (5) consider the energetic strategies used to sustain expensive signaling. The electric organ discharge (EOD) of B. gauderio changes in response to social environment on two time scales. Two hormone classes, melanocortins and androgens, underlie the short-term and long-term modulation of signal amplitude and duration observed during social interaction. Population density drives signal amplitude enhancement, unexpectedly improving the reliability with which the signal predicts the signaler's size. The signal's second phase elongation predicts androgen levels and male reproductive condition. Males sustain signal enhancement with dietary intake, but when food is limited, they 'go for broke' and put extra energy into electric signals. Cortisol diminishes EOD parameters, but energy-limited males offset cortisol effects by boosting androgen levels. While physiological constraints are sufficient to maintain signal amplitude reliability, phenotypic integration and signaling costs maintain reliability of signal duration, consistent with theory of honest signaling. © 2013.

abstract={The impact of temperature during incubation and gestation has been tested in various reptiles; the postnatal period has been rarely investigated however. Three groups of newborn aspic vipers (Vipera aspis) were placed under contrasted thermal regimes during 7 months: (1) a cool 23°C constant regime, (2) a warm 28°C constant regime, and (3) an optimal regime with free-access to a wide range of temperatures. Later, all the snakes were placed under hibernation conditions (6°C) during 3 months. Finally all the snakes were placed in the optimal thermal regime during 2 additional months. The total duration of the experiment was of 12 months. Body mass and feeding rates were recorded weekly, body size was measured monthly. We also assessed locomotor performance and recorded several behavioral traits (e.g., defensive and predatory behaviors). As expected, snakes raised under cool temperatures exhibited low feeding rate, growth rate, body condition, and they exhibited poor locomotor performance; they also displayed marked defensive behaviors (e.g., high number of defensive bites) whilst hesitating during longer periods to bite a prey. Such behavioral effects were detected at the end of the experiment (i.e., 5 months after exposure to contrasted thermal treatments [3 months of hibernation plus 2 months of optimal regime]), revealing long term effects. Surprisingly, growth rate and locomotor performance were not different between the two other groups, warm constant 28°C versus optimal regimes (albeit several behavioral traits differed), suggesting that the access to a wide range of ambient temperatures was not a crucial factor.

abstract={Ontogenetic changes in antipredator behavior optimize survival of growing animals. Leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) respond to a simulated predator either by postural and vocal threats, sometimes followed by biting, or alternatively by a rapid escape. The former "confrontational" and the latter "avoidance" behavior rarely occurs in a sequence; in fact, they represent mutually exclusive defensive strategies. We examined 552 individuals of a leopard gecko (E. macularius) of various ages, from hatching up to adulthood (31 months). Each experimental animal was exposed to a sequence of five "water-spraying" and ten "stick" (stick poking on base of the tail) stimuli, and the emitted behavior was recorded. We analyzed the effects of age, body size, body condition, adult-juvenile coloration, and sex on observed behavioral traits. The results showed that in the case of water-spraying stimulus, the usage of deterrent vocalization or escape tactic was affected by age and condition. In addition to that, using deterrent vocalization was influenced by the coloration of the animal. Stick stimulus evokes antipredator strategies that correspond with age and coloration (deterrent vocalization) and also with standardized body size (escape). Thus, leopard geckos exhibit clear ontogenetic change of defensive strategies, from threat-vocalization-bite strategy prevailing in juveniles to an escape strategy typical for adults. This behavioral change is accompanied by the ontogenetic switch of coloration from presumably warning contrasting light-dark banded pattern of juveniles to a cryptic spotted coloration of the adults. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The study of cooperation is rich with theoretical models and laboratory experiments that have greatly advanced our knowledge of human uniqueness, but have sometimes lacked ecological validity. We therefore emphasize the need to tie discussions of human cooperation to the natural history of our species and its closest relatives, focusing on behavioral contexts best suited to reveal underlying selection pressures and evolved decision rules. Food sharing is a fundamental form of cooperation that is well-studied across primates and is particularly noteworthy because of its central role in shaping evolved human life history, social organization, and cooperative psychology. Here we synthesize available evidence on food sharing in humans and other primates, tracing the origins of offspring provisioning, mutualism, trade, and reciprocity throughout the primate order. While primates may gain some benefits from sharing, humans, faced with more collective action problems in a risky foraging niche, expanded on primate patterns to buffer risk and recruit mates and allies through reciprocity and signaling, and established co-evolving social norms of production and sharing. Differences in the necessity for sharing are reflected in differences in sharing psychology across species, thus helping to explain unique aspects of our evolved cooperative psychology. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Predictions about the fate of species or populations under climate change scenarios typically neglect adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity, the two major mechanisms by which organisms can adapt to changing local conditions. As a consequence, we have little understanding of the scope for organisms to track changing environments by in situ adaptation. Here, we use a detailed individual-specific long-term population study of great tits (Parus major) breeding in Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK to parameterise a mechanistic model and thus directly estimate the rate of environmental change to which in situ adaptation is possible. Using the effect of changes in early spring temperature on temporal synchrony between birds and a critical food resource, we focus in particular on the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to population persistence. Despite using conservative estimates for evolutionary and reproductive potential, our results suggest little risk of population extinction under projected local temperature change; however, this conclusion relies heavily on the extent to which phenotypic plasticity tracks the changing environment. Extrapolating the model to a broad range of life histories in birds suggests that the importance of phenotypic plasticity for adjustment to projected rates of temperature change increases with slower life histories, owing to lower evolutionary potential. Understanding the determinants and constraints on phenotypic plasticity in natural populations is thus crucial for characterising the risks that rapidly changing environments pose for the persistence of such populations. © 2013 Vedder et al.},

abstract={Predator activity around the nests induces stress in breeding birds, which may have weaker immunity and are therefore more susceptible to parasite infections. The influence of predators on parasites has only been observed in land birds, and most studies are experimental. As seabird colonies offer excellent conditions for parasites, here we assess the influence of mouse, rat, and cat activity on parasites in Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis). Adults were examined for blood parasites and one adult and the juvenile from 53 nests were inspected for ectoparasites over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Nests differed in their physical characteristics and indices of mammal predator activity and were checked weekly to assess breeding success. Our results showed absence of blood parasites. Among the environmental factors, predator pressure received the most support (89 %) from the data as influencing nest ectoparasite intensity. Birds most infected had worse body condition, and breeding success was negatively influenced by predator activity and ectoparasite intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the interaction between mammal predators and ectoparasites in seabird species and supports greater protection through eradication efforts. In addition, we provide the first data on the endoparasite fauna of Cory's shearwater. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Unhealthy eating behaviors increase the risk of metabolic diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Because inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, it is important to understand the effects of unhealthy eating on the inflammatory state. The objective of our present study was to address the effects of a fasting-refeeding regime, a model of irregular eating, on the hepatic inflammatory responses in mouse. The animals were fasted for 48 h and then refed either a standard or low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet. Inflammatory gene expression in the liver was then sequentially measured for the first 17 h after initiation of refeeding. To assess the roles of dietary carbohydrates and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the refeeding-induced inflammatory changes, gene expression levels in mice refed only carbohydrates (α-corn starch and sucrose) at different doses and in TLR2-deficient mice refed a standard diet were also analyzed. Refeeding with a standard diet increased the liver expression of Tlr2, proinflammatory mediators (Cxcl10, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Icam-1) and negative regulators of TLR-signaling (A20 and Atf3). These increases were attenuated in mice refed a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet. Refeeding only α-corn starch and sucrose also increased the expression of these inflammatory pathway genes depending on the doses. TLR2 deficiency significantly attenuated the refeeding-induced increase in the liver expression of Cxcl10, Cxcl1, Icam-1 and A20. These findings suggest that an irregular eating behavior can elicit a liver inflammatory response, which is at least partly mediated by TLR2, and that dietary carbohydrates play critical roles in this process. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Rationale: Rearing rats in isolation from weaning is an established preclinical neurodevelopmental model which induces behavioural deficits with apparent translational relevance to some core symptoms of schizophrenia. Objective: This study evaluated the ability of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone to reverse behavioural deficits induced by post-weaning social isolation of rat pups and to further characterise the predictive validity of this model. Method: Forty-five male Lister hooded rats were housed in groups of 3-4 (n = 16) or singly (n = 29) for 4 weeks immediately after weaning on postnatal day (PND) 22-24. On PND 51, novel cage-induced locomotor activity (LMA) was assessed to subdivide rats into groups balanced for behavioural response. On PNDs 58, 59, 65 and 72, rats received either vehicle (1 ml/kg; i.p.) or risperidone (0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg; i.p.) 30 min prior to testing in LMA, novel object discrimination (NOD), prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and conditioned emotional response (CER) learning paradigms, respectively. Results: Isolation rearing had no effect on PPI, but produced LMA hyperactivity and impaired NOD and CER compared to group-housed controls. Risperidone caused a dose-dependent reduction in LMA, irrespective of rearing condition, but selectively reversed the NOD deficit in isolation-reared rats. Risperidone did not reverse the isolation rearing-induced CER deficit. Conclusions: Similar to its clinical profile, risperidone only partially reverses the schizophrenic symptomology; since it reversed some, but not all, of the learning and memory deficits induced by post-weaning isolation, the isolation rearing model may be useful to predict antipsychotic activity of novel therapeutic agents. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Acoustic noise has the potential to cause stress, to distract and to mask important sounds, and thus to affect behaviour. Human activities have added considerable noise to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and there is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise affects communication and movement patterns in a variety of species. However, there has been relatively little work considering the effect on behaviours that are fundamental to survival, and thus have direct fitness consequences. We conducted a series of controlled tank-based experiments to consider how playback of ship noise, the most common source of underwater noise, affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ship noise playback was more likely than ambient-noise playback to disrupt feeding, although crabs experiencing the two sound treatments did not differ in their likelihood of, or speed at, finding a food source in the first place. While crabs exposed to ship noise playback were just as likely as ambient-noise controls to detect and respond to a simulated predatory attack, they were slower to retreat to shelter. Ship noise playback also resulted in crabs that had been turned on their backs righting themselves faster than those experiencing ambient-noise playback; remaining immobile may reduce the likelihood of further predatory attention. Our findings therefore suggest that anthropogenic noise has the potential to increase the risks of starvation and predation, and showcases that the behaviour of invertebrates, and not just vertebrates, is susceptible to the impact of this pervasive global pollutant. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={While the eukaryotic genome is the same throughout all somatic cells in an organism, there are specific structures and functions that discern one type of cell from another. These differences are due to the cell's unique gene expression patterns that are determined during cellular differentiation. Interestingly, these cell-specific gene expression patterns can be affected by an organism's environment throughout its lifetime leading to phenotypical changes that have the potential of altering risk of some diseases. Both cell-specific gene expression signatures and environment mediated changes in expression patterns can be explained by a complex network of modifications to the DNA, histone proteins and degree of DNA packaging called epigenetic marks. Several areas of research have formed to study these epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and microRNA (miRNA). The original definition of epigenetics incorporates inheritable but reversible phenomena that affect gene expression without altering base pairs. Even though not all of the above listed epigenetic traits have demonstrated heritability, they can all alter gene transcription without modification to the underlying genetic sequence. Because these epigenetic patterns can also be affected by an organism's environment, they serve as an important bridge between life experiences and phenotypes. Epigenetic patterns may change throughout one's lifespan, by an early life experience, environmental exposure or nutritional status. Epigenetic signatures influenced by the environment may determine our appearance, behavior, stress response, disease susceptibility, and even longevity. The interaction between types of epigenetic modifications in response to environmental factors and how environmental cues affect epigenetic patterns will further elucidate how gene transcription can be affectively altered. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Nutritional factors play a life-long role in human health. Indeed, there is growing evidence that one of the mechanisms by which nutrients and bioactive compounds affect metabolic traits is epigenetics. Complex interactions among food components and histone modifications, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA expression and chromatin remodeling factors lead to a dynamic regulation of gene expression that controls the cellular phenotype. Although perinatal period is the time of highest phenotypic plasticity, contributing largely to developmental programming, also during adulthood there is evidence about a nutritional influence on epigenetic regulation. Similarly to type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and other metabolic disorders, obesity predisposition and weight loss outcomes have been repeatedly associated to changes in epigenetic patterns. Different non-nutritional risk factors that usually accompany obesity seem also to be involved in these epigenetic modifications, especially hyperglycemia, inflammation, hypoxia and oxidative stress. There are currently three major objectives in epigenetic research in relation to obesity: to search for epigenetic biomarkers to predict future health problems or detect the individuals at most risk, to understand the obesity-related environmental factors that could modulate gene expression by affecting epigenetic mechanisms, and to study novel therapeutic strategies based on nutritional or pharmacological agents that can modify epigenetic marks. At this level, the major tasks are: development of robust epigenetic biomarkers of weight regulation, description of those epigenetic marks more susceptible to be modified by dietary exposures, identification of the active ingredients (and the doses) that alter the epigenome, assessment of the real importance of other obesity-related factors on epigenetic regulation, determination of the period of life in which best results are obtained, and understanding the importance of the inheritance of these epigenetic marks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Immune function can be modulated by multiple physiological factors, including nutrition and reproductive state. Because these factors can vary throughout an individual's lifetime as a result of environmental conditions (affecting nutrition) or life-history stage (e.g. entering the adult reproduction stage), we must carefully examine the degree to which developmental versus adult conditions shape performance of the immune system. We investigated how variation in dietary access to carotenoid pigments - a class of molecules with immunostimulatory properties that females deposit into egg yolks - during three different developmental time points affected adult immunological and reproductive traits in female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). In males and females of other avian species, carotenoid access during development affects carotenoid assimilation ability, adult sexual ornamentation and immune function, while carotenoid access during adulthood can increase immune response and reproductive investment (e.g. egg-laying capacity, biliverdin deposition in eggshells). We failed to detect effects of developmental carotenoid supplementation on adult immune function [phytohemagglutinin-induced cutaneous immune response, antibody production in response to the novel antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), or oxidative burst, assessed by changes in circulating nitric oxide levels], carotenoid-pigmented beak coloration, ovarian development, circulating carotenoid levels or concentration of bile pigments in the gall bladder. However, we did uncover positive relationships between circulating carotenoid levels during adulthood and KLH-specific antibody production, and a negative relationship between biliverdin concentration in bile and KLH-specific antibody production. These results are consistent with the view that adult physiological parameters better predict current immune function than do developmental conditions, and highlight a possible, previously unstudied relationship between biliverdin and immune system performance. © 2013.

abstract={The ascarosides, small-molecule signals derived from combinatorial assembly of primary metabolism-derived building blocks, play a central role in Caenorhabditis elegans biology and regulate many aspects of development and behavior in this model organism as well as in other nematodes. Using HPLC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics, we identified novel ascarosides incorporating a side chain derived from succinylation of the neurotransmitter octopamine. These compounds, named osas#2, osas#9, and osas#10, are produced predominantly by L1 larvae, where they serve as part of a dispersal signal, whereas these ascarosides are largely absent from the metabolomes of other life stages. Investigating the biogenesis of these octopamine- derived ascarosides, we found that succinylation represents a previously unrecognized pathway of biogenic amine metabolism. At physiological concentrations, the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine are converted to a large extent into the corresponding succinates, in addition to the previously described acetates. Chemically, bimodal deactivation of biogenic amines via acetylation and succinylation parallels posttranslational modification of proteins via acetylation and succinylation of L-lysine. Our results reveal a small-molecule connection between neurotransmitter signaling and interorganismal regulation of behavior and suggest that ascaroside biosynthesis is based in part on co-option of degradative biochemical pathways. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Predation, predation risk, and resource quality affect suites of prey traits that collectively impact individual fitness, population dynamics, and community structure. However, studies of multitrophic level effects generally focus on a single prey trait, failing to capture trade-offs among suites of covarying traits that govern population responses and emergent community patterns. We used structural equation models (SEM) to summarize the non-lethal and lethal effects of crayfish, Procambarus fallax, and phosphorus (P) addition, which affected prey food quality (periphyton), on the interactive effects of behavioral, morphological, developmental, and reproductive traits of snails, Planorbella duryi. Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested trade-offs between production (growth, reproduction) and defense (foraging behavior, shell shape) traits of snails in response to non-lethal crayfish and P addition, but few lethal effects. SEM revealed that non-lethal crayfish effects indirectly limited per capi za offspring standing stock by increasing refuge use, slowing individual growth, and inducing snails to produce thicker, compressed shells. The negative effects of non-lethal crayfish on snails were strongest with P addition; snails increased allocation to shell defense rather than growth or reproduction. However, compared to ambient conditions, P addition with non-lethal crayfish still yielded greater per capita offspring standing stock by speeding individual snail growth enabling them to produce more offspring that also grew faster. Increased refuge use in response to non-lethal crayfish led to a non-lethal trophic cascade that altered the spatial distribution of periphyton. Independent of crayfish effects, snails stimulated periphyton growth through nutrient regeneration. These findings illustrate the importance of studying suites of traits that reveal costs associated with inducing different traits and how expressing those traits impacts population and community level processes. © 2013 Ruehl and Trexler.},

abstract={The quality and availability of resources influence the geographical distribution of species. Social species need safe places to rest, meet, exchange information and obtain thermoregulatory benefits, but those places may also serve other important functions that have been overlooked in research. We use a large soaring bird that roosts communally in cliffs, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), as a model species to elucidate whether roost locations serve as a refuge from adverse weather conditions (climatic refuge hypothesis, CRH), and/or from predators or anthropogenic disturbances (threats refuge hypothesis, TRH). The CRH predicts that communal roosts will face in the opposite direction from where storms originate, and will be located in climatically stable, low precipitation areas. The TRH predicts that communal roosts will be large, poorly accessible cliffs, located far from human-made constructions. We surveyed cliffs used as communal roosts by condors in northwestern Patagonia, and compared them with alternative non-roosting cliffs to test these predictions at local and regional scales. We conclude that communal roosting places provide refuge against climate and disturbances such as, for instance, the threats of predators (including humans). Thus, it is not only the benefits gained from being aggregated per se, but the characteristics of the place selected for roosting that may both be essential for the survival of the species. This should be considered in management and conservation plans given the current scenario of global climate change and the increase in environmental disturbances. © 2013 Lambertucci, Ruggiero.},

abstract={According to theory in life-history and animal personality, individuals with high fitness expectations should be risk-averse, while individuals with low fitness expectations should be more bold. In female house mice, a selfish genetic element, the t haplotype, is associated with increased longevity under natural conditions, representing an appropriate case study to investigate this recent theory empirically. Following theory, females heterozygous for the t haplotype (+/t) are hypothesised to express more reactive personality traits and be more shy, less explorative and less active compared to the shorter-lived homozygous wildtype females (+/+). As males of different haplotype do not differ in survival, no similar pattern is expected. We tested these predictions by quantifying boldness, exploration, activity, and energetic intake in both +/t and +/+ mice. +/t females, unlike +/+ ones, expressed some reactive-like personality traits: +/t females were less active, less prone to form an exploratory routine and tended to ingest less food. Taken together these results suggest that differences in animal personality may contribute to the survival advantage observed in +/t females but fail to provide full empirical support for recent theory. © 2013 Auclair et al.},

abstract={NMDA receptors are activated after binding of the agonist glutamate to the NR2 subunit along with a co-agonist, either L-glycine or D-serine, to the NR1 subunit. There is substantial evidence to suggest that D-serine is the most relevant co-agonist in forebrain regions and that alterations in D-serine levels contribute to psychiatric disorders. D-serine is produced through isomerization of L-serine by serine racemase (Srr), either in neurons or in astrocytes. It is released by astrocytes by an activity-dependent mechanism involving secretory vesicles. In the present study we generated transgenic mice (SrrTg) expressing serine racemase under a human GFAP promoter. These mice were biochemically and behaviorally analyzed using paradigms of anxiety, depression and cognition. Furthermore, we investigated the behavioral effects of long-term administration of D-serine added to the drinking water. Elevated brain D-serine levels in SrrTg mice resulted in specific behavioral phenotypes in the forced swim, novelty suppression of feeding and olfactory bulbectomy paradigms that are indicative of a reduced proneness towards depression-related behavior. Chronic dietary D-serine supplement mimics the depression-related behavioral phenotype observed in SrrTg mice. Our results suggest that D-serine supplementation may improve mood disorders. © 2013 Otte et al.},

abstract={Objective: Sedentary behaviour may contribute to the development of obesity. We investigated the relations between different types of sedentary behaviour and adiposity markers in a well-characterised adult population after controlling for a wide range of potential confounders. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Multicenter Study. Participants Sedentary time (TV viewing, computer time, reading, music/radio listening and other relaxation) was assessed with a questionnaire for 1084 women and 909 men aged 30-45 years. Other study variables included occupational and leisure-time physical activity, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol consumption, energy intake, adherence to the recommended diet, multiple individual food items, age and genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI). Primary outcome measures BMI in kg/m2 and waist circumference (WC in cm). Results: Of the different sedentary behaviour types, TV viewing was most consistently related to higher BMI and WC, both in men and women. One additional daily TV hour was associated with a 1.81±0.44 cm larger WC in women and 2 cm±0.44 cm in men (both p<0.0001). The association with TV was diluted, but remained highly significant after adjustments with all measured covariates, including several potentially obesogenic food items associated with TV viewing. The intakes of food items such as sausage, beer and soft drinks were directly associated with TV viewing, while the intakes of oat and barley, fish, and fruits and berries were associated indirectly. After these adjustments, non-TV sedentary behaviour remained associated with adiposity indices only in women. Conclusions: Out of the different types of sedentary behaviour, TV viewing was most consistently associated with adiposity markers in adults. Partial dilution of these associations after adjustments for covariates suggests that the obesogenic effects of TV viewing are partly mediated by other lifestyle factors.},

abstract={Seasonal declines in avian clutch size are well documented, but seasonal variation in other reproductive parameters has received less attention. For example, the probability of complete brood mortality typically explains much of the variation in reproductive success and often varies seasonally, but we know little about the underlying cause of that variation. This oversight is surprising given that nest predation influences many other life-history traits and varies throughout the breeding season in many songbirds. To determine the underlying causes of observed seasonal decreases in risk of nest predation, we modeled nest predation of Dusky Flycatchers (Empidonax oberholseri) in northern California as a function of foliage phenology, energetic demand, developmental stage, conspecific nest density, food availability for nest predators, and nest predator abundance. Seasonal variation in the risk of nest predation was not associated with seasonal changes in energetic demand, conspecific nest density, or predator abundance. Instead, seasonal variation in the risk of nest predation was associated with foliage density (early, but not late, in the breeding season) and seasonal changes in food available to nest predators. Supplemental food provided to nest predators resulted in a numerical response by nest predators, increasing the risk of nest predation at nests that were near supplemental feeders. Our results suggest that seasonal changes in foliage density and factors associated with changes in food availability for nest predators are important drivers of temporal patterns in risk of avian nest predation.},

abstract={The risk of hypoglycemia with anti-hyperglycemic agents is an important limiting factor in the management of type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. While hypoglycemia is more common in T1DM, the incidence is high in T2DM patients who use insulin or secretagogues, particularly patients with longer duration of diabetes. The underlying cause of hypoglycemia in diabetes is a complex interaction between hyperinsulinemia and compromised physiologic and behavioral responses to falling glucose levels. Pancreatic dysfunction also causes loss of normal therapeutic response to hypoglycemia-a reduction in circulating insulin (in T2DM only) and an increase in glucagon secretion. In T1DM and advanced T2DM, the third defense against hypoglycemia is increase in adrenomedullary sympathoadrenal epinephrine secretion, which is also compromised, causing the syndrome of defective glucose counterregulation. Diminished increase in epinephrine, also called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), is largely responsible for defective glucose counterregulation. HAAF can result in recurrent hypoglycemia and lowering of glycemic threshold that typically triggers sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia. This results in hypoglycemia without warning symptoms, or "hypoglycemia unawareness," which increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Long-term effects of severe hypoglycemia, aside from causing accidents, may include adverse cardiovascular outcomes and cognitive impairment. To reduce the impact of hypoglycemia, it is important to identify patients at risk and use careful consideration when choosing antidiabetes medications. Newer insulin analogs that more accurately replicate endogenous insulin secretion and incretin therapies that cause glucose-sensitive insulin secretion may ultimately reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Humans exposed to shiftwork conditions have been reported to have increased susceptibility to various health problems including various forms of dementia, cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders related to obesity. The present experiments assessed the effects of circadian disruption on learning and memory function and various food related processes including diet consumption rates, food metabolism, and changes in body weight. These experiments utilized a novel variant of the conditioned place preference task (CPP) that is normally used to assess Pavlovian associative learning and memory processes produced via repeated context-reward pairings. For the present experiments, the standard CPP paradigm was modified in that both contexts were paired with food, but the dietary constituents of the food were different. In particular, we were interested in whether rats could differentiate between two types of carbohydrates, simple (dextrose) and complex (starch). Consumption rates for each type of carbohydrate were measured throughout training. A test of context preference without the food present was also conducted. At the end of behavioral testing, a fasting glucose test and a glucose challenge test were administered. Chronic photoperiod shifting resulted in impaired context learning and memory processes thought to be mediated by a neural circuit centered on the hippocampus. The results also showed that preferences for the different carbohydrate diets were altered in rats experiencing photoperiod shifting in that they maintained an initial preference for the simple carbohydrate throughout training. Lastly, photoperiod shifting resulted in changes in fasting blood glucose levels and elicited weight gain. These results show that chronic photoperiod shifting, which likely resulted in circadian dysfunction, impairs multiple functions of the brain and/or body in the same individual. © 2013.},

abstract={Daidzein is one of the most important isoflavones present in soy and it is unique as it can be further metabolized to equol, a compound with greater estrogenic activity than other isoflavones. The potential role of daidzein in the prevention of some chronic diseases has drawn public attention and increased its consumption in human, including in pregnant women and adolescent. It is unclear whether perinatal exposure to daidzein through maternal diets affects subsequent behavior and central estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression in male adults. Following developmental exposure to daidzein through maternal diets during perinatal period, subsequent anxiety-like behavior, social behavior, spatial learning and memory of male mice at adulthood were assessed using a series of tests. The levels of central ER α expression were also examined using immunocytochemistry. Compared with the controls, adult male mice exposed to daidzein during the perinatal period showed significantly less exploration, higher levels of anxiety and aggression. They also displayed more social investigation for females and a tendency to improve spatial learning and memory. The mice with this early daidzein treatment demonstrated significantly higher levels of ERα expression in several brain regions such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic, arcuate hypothalamic nucleus and central amygdaloid mucleus, but decreased it in the lateral septum. Our results indicated that perinatal exposure to daidzein enhanced masculinization on male behaviors which is assocciated with alterations in ERα expression levels led by perinatal daidzein exposure. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Thermal quality and predation risk are considered important factors influencing habitat patch use in ectothermic prey. However, how the predator's food requirement and the prey's necessity to avoid predation interact with their respective thermoregulatory strategies remains poorly understood. The recently developed 'thermal game model' predicts that in the face of imminent predation, prey should divide their time equally among a range of thermal patches. In contrast, predators should concentrate their hunting activities towards warmer patches. In this study, we test these predictions in a laboratory setup and an artificial environment that mimics more natural conditions. In both cases, we scored thermal patch use of newt larvae (prey) and free-ranging dragonfly nymphs (predators). Similar effects were seen in both settings. The newt larvae spent less time in the warm patch if dragonfly nymphs were present. The patch use of the dragonfly nymphs did not change as a function of prey availability, even when the nymphs were starved prior to the experiment. Our behavioral observations partially corroborate predictions of the thermal game model. In line with asymmetric fitness pay-offs in predator-prey interactions (the 'life-dinner' principle), the prey's thermal strategy is more sensitive to the presence of predators than vice versa. © 2013 Gvoždík et al.},

abstract={Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce) or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1) dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly, individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions differing in food availability. Our study highlights the importance of taking both social factors and boldness (heterogeneity) into account when studying social-foraging dynamics and offers empirical data on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics that can be used to extend current models and experiments on social foraging. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Males of many species prefer females that are more fecund, novel and/or sexually receptive. Males assess the desirability of potential mates using female morphological traits, including size and sexual coloration, or olfactory cues. However, few studies have directly examined how female behaviour influences male mate choice, which is surprising because males often respond strongly to female behaviours. We examined factors influencing male preference using the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, a species with a large repertoire of behavioural displays. Males were presented with two tethered females in a paired choice test, and we measured the time that males spent associating with and courting (shuddering to) each female. We recorded female behaviour, including approach to and retreat from the male, sidlehopping (a rejection behaviour) and pushups. Males associated more with females that (1) approached and retreated from them, (2) did not sidlehop and (3) had relatively higher body condition. Likewise, males shuddered more to females that approached and retreated from them. Approach and retreat behaviours may advertise a female's readiness to mate, as these behaviours can heighten male interest, suggesting that males may be most likely to invest in courtship once females indicate their willingness to mate. Neither the female's pushup behaviour nor her snout-vent length influenced a male's tendency to associate with or court her. These results provide evidence that female behaviour has an important influence on male courtship behaviour. Incorporating measures of female behaviour into future studies on male mate choice may be illuminating and provide a greater ability to predict male preference. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Winter acclimatization in birds is a complex of several strategies based on metabolic adjustment accompanied by long-term management of resources such as fattening. However, wintering birds often maintain fat reserves below their physiological capacity, suggesting a cost involved with excessive levels of reserves. We studied body reserves of roosting great tits in relation to their dominance status under two contrasting temperature regimes to see whether individuals are capable of optimizing their survival strategies under extreme environmental conditions. We predicted less pronounced loss of body mass and body condition and lower rates of overnight mortality in dominant great tits at both mild and extremely low ambient temperatures, when ambient temperature dropped down to -43 °C. The results showed that dominant great tits consistently maintained lower reserve levels than subordinates regardless of ambient temperature. However, dominants responded to the rising risk of starvation under low temperatures by increasing their body reserves, whereas subdominant birds decreased reserve levels in harsh conditions. Yet, their losses of body mass and body reserves were always lower than in subordinate birds. None of the dominant great tits were found dead, while five young females and one adult female were found dead in nest boxes during cold spells when ambient temperatures dropped down to -43 °C. The dead great tits lost up to 23.83 % of their evening body mass during cold nights while surviving individuals lost on average 12.78 % of their evening body mass. Our results show that fattening strategies of great tits reflect an adaptive role of winter fattening which is sensitive to changes in ambient temperatures and differs among individuals of different social ranks. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Life expectancy in the last century has greatly increased although, in most industrialized countries, this has been paralleled by an increased incidence of neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies. The p66Shc gene has emerged as a novel gerontogene affecting health throughout life and during aging. In the last decade, studies on p66Shc knock-out mice have indicated that this gene is a crucial regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and is involved in age-related dysfunctions. p66Shc-/- mice show indeed a healthy phenotype characterized by greater brain and behavioral plasticity - associated to increased central levels of the neurotrophin Bran-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - in addition to reduced oxidative stress, fat accumulation and incidence of metabolic and cardiovascular pathologies. Studies performed in a semi-naturalistic setting, involving exposure to low temperatures and food shortage indicate that p66Shc has been conserved through evolution because of its role as "thrifty gene" in energy metabolism. This feature, which allows survival in harsh natural conditions, can be deleterious when food is constantly available, as in westernized lifestyles, leading to fat accumulation and predisposing to metabolic, cardiovascular diseases and accelerating brain aging. Being at the crossroad of signaling pathways involved in both central and peripheral stress responses and in the regulation of energy homeostasis, p66Shc is a good candidate molecule to address the mechanisms underlying healthy aging and to be targeted for the development of novel pharmacological tools for the prevention or cure of age-related pathologies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We conducted observations of two neighboring groups of food-enhanced long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) over a period of one year. We examined their diet, behavior, habitat use, and ranging and how within-population variability reflected differential utilization of anthropogenic food resources. The group that consumed more anthropogenic food spent less time feeding on wild fruits and flowers, less time resting, and more time locomoting. They used forest habitats less often, and had a larger total home range and mean monthly home range. Some of these results contrasted with previous studies of food-enhanced primates which reported that food-enhancement resulted in smaller home ranges, shorter daily ranges, less time traveling and feeding, and more time resting. These contrasting patterns may relate to the nature of anthropogenic foods. In most studies of food-enhanced primates, anthropogenic food resources were abundant and concentrated but the macaques in this study used anthropogenic foods mainly from a few refuse sites where they had limited access, and from dispersed and irregular human provisioning. The group consuming more anthropogenic food therefore showed more spatially dispersed feeding activity and home range use, an effect that was likely further enhanced by lower natural food resource availability within their home range. The Singapore macaque population shows small-scale variability in feeding and ranging behavior, contributing to the complexity of their adaptive variability in a human-altered habitat. Our findings could have important implications for mitigating human-macaque conflict as measures applied at a higher spatial or population level may achieve highly inconsistent results, intensifying the challenges for wildlife managers. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Natural disasters can degrade primate habitat and alter feeding behavior. Here, we examined the influence of unusually heavy snow on diet and feeding-site use by Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) in northern Japan. To compare the winter-feeding behavior under different snow conditions, we recorded the plant species foraged on by macaques in multiple transects of the Shirakami Mountains from 2008 to 2012 (excluding 2011). We used cluster analysis to describe foraged plant assemblages, and applied multiple dimensional scaling and decision tree modeling to evaluate annual variation in feeding-site use by macaques. Our cluster analysis revealed five types of foraged plant assemblages. The proportion of each type present in transects varied considerably across the years, indicating that the diet of macaques in heavy snow conditions was influenced more by resource accessibility than by preference. Multiple dimensional scaling and decision tree modeling demonstrated that heavy snow conditions restricted feeding-site use. Moreover, the distribution of refuges relative to severe external ambient environments was a stronger limiting factor for feeding-site use than was the availability of food resources. While most primate species facing unexpected starvation employ risk-prone foraging tactics (i.e., choosing the option with higher pay-off by accepting risk), Japanese macaques have a tendency to adopt risk-averse foraging behavior (i.e., minimizing energy loss when searching for preferred diet items under long-lasting heavy snow conditions), because winters with temperatures below freezing have higher thermoregulatory costs. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Given the popularity of feeding white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Texas and the increasing amount of corn that is distributed, more information is needed on the impacts of this activity on non-target wildlife. Our objectives were to report visitation, intra- and interspecific contact, and contact rates of wildlife at artificial feeding sites in Texas. Our study was conducted at three sites in Kleberg and Nueces counties, Texas. We trapped animals from February to April and August to September, 2009 and marked animals with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. At each site and season, we placed one feeder system containing a PIT tag reader within 600 m of trap locations. Readers detected PIT tags from a distance of 25 cm. We determined a contact event to occur when two different PIT tags were detected by feeder systems within 5 s. We recorded 62,719 passes by raccoons (Procyon lotor), 103,512 passes by collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), 2,923 passes by feral swine (Sus scrofa), 1,336 passes by fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), and no passes by opossums (Didelphis virginiana) at feeder systems. For site-season combinations in which contact events occurred, we found intraspecific contact rates (contacts per day) for raccoons, collared peccaries, and feral swine to be 0.81-124.77, 0.69-38.08, and 0.0-0.66, respectively. Throughout our study we distributed ~2,625 kg of whole kernel corn, which resulted in 6,351 contact events between marked wildlife (2.4 contacts per kg of corn). If 136 million kg of corn is distributed in Texas annually, we would expect >5.2 billion unnatural contact events between wildlife would result from this activity each year in Texas. Consequently, we do not believe that it is wise for natural resource managers to maintain artificial feeding sites for white-tailed deer or other wildlife due to pathogen transmission risks. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).},

abstract={Background: During recovery from alcoholism, other behavior likely increases. The development of alternative behavior may reduce attention to alcohol-associated stimuli. This could result in greater persistence of the alternative behavior when individuals again encounter alcohol-associated stimuli that might precipitate relapse. Developing animal models of this process could facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in relapse and recovery. However, current preclinical models of recovery and relapse rarely measure alternative behavior. Thus, our objective was to establish a procedure in rats in which an increase in alternative behavior (responding for food) reduced responding for ethanol (EtOH). The amount of responding for food and EtOH was then assessed after re-exposure to the alcohol-associated stimulus after varying the number of preceding sessions of increased responding for food and reduced responding for EtOH. These results were compared with those from a parallel group responding for saccharin solution instead of EtOH. Methods: The solution (EtOH or saccharin) was always available following 5 responses. Presentation of flashing stimulus lights indicated food delivery followed 150 responses and resulted in responding predominately for the solution (84 to 86% of total responses). Presentation of solid stimulus lights indicated food delivery followed 5 responses and resulted in responding predominately for food (1 to 3% of total responses were for the solution). Rats were exposed to solid light conditions for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 16 consecutive sessions before being re-exposed to the flashing stimulus lights in extinction. Results: Responding for either solution resumed when rats were re-exposed to the flashing stimulus lights (associated with solution-predominate responding). However, more responses occurred on the food lever with longer recent histories of responding for food instead of the solution. Conclusions: These results suggest that the longer alternative behavior replaces drinking, the more that attention to stimuli associated with drinking decreases. These results are consistent with the notion that the risk of relapse declines with longer periods of recovery because alternative behavior comes to predominate even in the presence of stimuli associated with drinking. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

abstract={How does an organism's internal state direct its actions? At one moment an animal forages for food with acrobatic feats such as tree climbing and jumping between branches. At another time, it travels along the ground to find water or a mate, exposing itself to predators along the way. These behaviors are costly in terms of energy or physical risk, and the likelihood of performing one set of actions relative to another is strongly modulated by internal state. For example, an animal in energy deficit searches for food and a dehydrated animal looks for water. The crosstalk between physiological state and motivational processes influences behavioral intensity and intent, but the underlying neural circuits are poorly understood. Molecular genetics along with optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools for perturbing neuron function have enabled cell type-selective dissection of circuits that mediate behavioral responses to physiological state changes. Here, we review recent progress into neural circuit analysis of hunger in the mouse by focusing on a starvation-sensitive neuron population in the hypothalamus that is sufficient to promote voracious eating. We also consider research into the motivational processes that are thought to underlie hunger in order to outline considerations for bridging the gap between homeostatic and motivational neural circuits. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Parents have limited resources and, when simultaneously rearing multiple offspring, are expected to favour particularly valuable offspring. Because offspring characteristics like sex and ornamentation influence future reproductive value, these traits may influence parental favouritism. Parents in high-quality nest environments should prefer sons because sons show greater variability in reproductive potential than daughters. Moreover, when ornamental plumage coloration is condition dependent, parents should favour brighter over duller sons. We tested parental favouritism for fledgling-aged eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, a species in which fledglings display condition-dependent UV-blue coloration on their wings and tails. We simultaneously threatened two offspring with mock predators and recorded which offspring the parents defended. In accordance with the predicted value of offspring, fathers protected brighter over duller sons and protected sons over daughters when mated to high-quality mates. Mothers did not discriminate between sons and daughters or between brighter and duller sons. These results suggest that ornamental plumage coloration in juvenile bluebirds functions as a signal in father-offspring interactions. Paternal and maternal responses of eastern bluebirds to offspring characteristics may differ because of differences in parental allocation strategies or because males assess offspring quality based on variation in plumage coloration, a trait that also functions in competitive interactions among adult males. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={One of the most striking aspects of spider biology is web building and silk spinning. While webs and silks vary widely among species, web architecture and silk mechanics are also plastic at the individual level. This review will focus on plasticity in web architecture and silk mechanics. Plasticity in web architecture exists in both orb webs and cobwebs. Web building, including the presence of a stabilimentum, is influenced by several environmental factors, including foraging success, prey type, presence of predators and spatial constraints. Various models, such as optimal foraging, optimal performance and physiological limitations, have attempted to explain web architecture plasticity. The mechanics and stickiness of silk is also influenced by the environment, including prey type and nutritional content, spider condition and silk use. An interesting phenomenon is major ampullate silk's response to water, termed supercontraction, and characterized by shrinking and rubberlike behaviour. Silk mechanics may change through changes in silk biochemistry or changes in silk dope processing. As web architecture and silk mechanics combine to determine web behaviour, web and silk plasticity may have consequences for whole web performance by affecting web's ability to sustain impacts, retain prey and transmit prey vibrations. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Dietary components, particularly essential fatty acids, affect the expression and maintenance of normal physiological phenotypes. However, the influence of C18 fatty acids that are abundantly present in the normal diet is unclear. We focused on the behavioural and neurochemical effects of C18 fatty acids during postweaning development in male mice. An AIN-93G diet supplemented with 8% stearic acid (C18:0), 3% oleic acid (C18:1), 3% linoleic acid (C18:2) or 3% α-linolenic acid (C18:3) was provided from four weeks of age for eight weeks. At 12 weeks of age, novel exploratory behaviour and social interaction tests were carried out. One week after the last behavioural test, the brain of each mouse was removed. The frequency of social interactive behaviour was decreased by approximately 70% in the C18:0 group compared to the basal diet group, but there was no difference in cumulative time. The frequency of social interaction showed a positive correlation to cumulative time in mice fed with the experimental diets except for C18:0. Dietary C18 fatty acids following weaning had no impact on brain fatty acid composition except for the C18:3 diet. Furthermore, the neurochemical properties to be especially noted were that choline acetyltransferase activity was absolutely higher in C18:0 diet-fed mice than in the other groups, especially in the frontal cortex where it was 1.7-fold higher than in the basal diet-fed group. The present results reveal a significant possibility of neurochemical and behavioural effects of dietary fatty acids, and saturated fatty acids are of special importance during the postweaning period. © 2013 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.},

abstract={Chronic exposure to stressors has been shown to suppress immune function in vertebrates, making them more susceptible to pathogens. It is less clear, however, whether many natural stressors are immunosuppressive. Moreover, whether stressors make disease more likely or more severe in populations is unclear because animals respond to stressors both behaviorally and physiologically. We tested whether chronic exposure to three natural stressors of wood frog tadpoles - high-densities, predator-cues, and low-food conditions - influence their susceptibility to a lethal ranavirus both individually in laboratory experiments, and collectively in outdoor mesocosms. Prior to virus exposure, we observed elevated corticosterone only in low-food treatments, although other treatments altered rates of growth and development as well as tadpole behavior. None of the treatments, however, increased susceptibility to ranavirus as measured by the proportion of tadpoles that became infected or died, or the time to death compared to controls. In fact, mortality in the mesocosms was actually lower in the high-density treatment even though most individuals became infected, largely because of increased rates of metamorphosis. Overall we find no support for the hypothesis that chronic exposure to common, ecologically relevant challenges necessarily elevates corticosterone levels in a population or leads to more severe ranaviral disease or epidemics. Conditions may, however, conspire to make ranavirus infection more common in metamorphosing amphibians. © 2013 International Association for Ecology and Health.},

abstract={Wild animals increasingly inhabit human-influenced environments such as forest fragments amid agricultural systems. Dietary studies provide a means of assessing wildlife responses to anthropogenic habitat changes. Chimpanzees are specialist frugivores that consume other plant parts, e.g., fibrous pith and leaves, in greater amounts during fruit shortages. I examined the plant diet and seasonal foraging strategies of chimpanzees inhabiting small forest fragments within a cultivated landscape in Uganda. I determined diet over 13 mo via systematic fecal analysis, supplemented by direct observation and feeding trace evidence. I identified important foods and examined their role as seasonal fallbacks. Diet composition and breadth were overall species typical. Chimpanzees were highly frugivorous and the fruit component of fecal samples exceeded that of nonfruit fiber in all months. Forest fruit availability fluctuated seasonally, including a 3-mo low fruiting season, when overall fruit intake declined. During this time chimpanzees pursued a mixed strategy of increasing fiber consumption and feeding more heavily on energy-rich cultivars, including those obtained through crop raiding. The data suggest that exploiting agricultural fruits helped chimpanzees maintain a fruit-dominated diet when forest fruit was scarce. No evidence suggested this disturbed forest-farm mosaic is a food-impoverished habitat for chimpanzees overall. Nevertheless, cultivar feeding creates conflict with people and the high nutritional quality of crops is likely offset by the inherent risk associated with obtaining them. This study adds to growing evidence of ecological and behavioral adaptability of Pan troglodytes in response to anthropogenic habitat alteration. Targeted conservation of key natural foods for wildlife -particularly fallbacks- would help reduce conflicts and improve the survival prospects of threatened species sharing environments with people. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The higher rate of obesity among low-income women has widely been attributed to environmental barriers; however, many low-income women are still able to maintain a healthy weight despite obesogenic environments. To better understand personal and behavioral attributes related to food choice and weight, overweight/obese women and lean/normal weight women living in similar low-income environments, participated in focus groups, and taste testing sessions to investigate food liking (n=83). During focus groups, lean/normal weight participants reported that health was influential in food choice, while overweight/obese participants expressed cost as being more of a factor. Both BMI (kg/m2) groups reported that taste was of greatest importance. Personal factors, like emotional eating, and overeating were also discussed with differences noted between BMI (kg/m2) groups. Quantitative data also showed cost to be more important for overweight/obese women. Taste testing results revealed that overweight/obese participants had a higher overall liking for both healthy and less healthy foods, as well as other food categories. Additionally, these women had a higher liking of fat in the context of spreadable fats. Our results show that a variety of complex factors interact to influence eating behavior and present weight status of women living in similarly impoverished environments.

We hypothesized that dingoes, being of domestic origin, would be adaptable to anthropogenic resource subsidies and that their space use would be affected by the dispersion of those resources. We tested this by analyzing Resource Selection Functions (RSFs) developed from GPS fixes (locations) of dingoes in arid central Australia. Using Generalized Linear Mixed-effect Models (GLMMs), we investigated resource relationships for dingoes that had access to abundant food near mine facilities, and for those that did not. From these models, we predicted the probability of dingo occurrence in relation to anthropogenic resource subsidies and other habitat characteristics over ∼ 18,000 km2. Very small standard errors and subsequent pervasively high P-values of results will become more important as the size of data sets, such as our GPS tracking logs, increases. Therefore, we also investigated methods to minimize the effects of serial and spatio-temporal correlation among samples and unbalanced study designs. Using GLMMs, we accounted for some of the correlation structure of GPS animal tracking data; however, parameter standard errors remained very small and all predictors were highly significant. Consequently, we developed an alternative approach that allowed us to review effect sizes at different spatial scales and determine which predictors were sufficiently ecologically meaningful to include in final RSF models. We determined that the most important predictor for dingo occurrence around mine sites was distance to the refuse facility. Away from mine sites, close proximity to human-provided watering points was predictive of dingo dispersion as were other landscape factors including palaeochannels, rocky rises and elevated drainage depressions. Our models demonstrate that anthropogenically supplemented food and water can alter dingo-resource relationships. The spatial distribution of such resources is therefore critical for the conservation and management of dingoes and other top predators. © 2013 Newsome et al.},

abstract={Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (Nr1h4, FXR) is a bile acid activated nuclear receptor mainly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney and adrenal glands. Upon activation, the primary function is to suppress cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic or neutral bile acid synthesis pathway. In the present study, a novel Fxr deficient mouse line was created and studied with respect to metabolism and liver function in ageing mice fed chow diet. The Fxr deficient mice were similar to wild type mice in terms of body weight, body composition, energy intake and expenditure as well as behaviours at a young age. However, from 15 weeks of age and onwards, the Fxr deficient mice had almost no body weight increase up to 39 weeks of age mainly because of lower body fat mass. The lower body weight gain was associated with increased energy expenditure that was not compensated by increased food intake. Fasting levels of glucose and insulin were lower and glucose tolerance was improved in old and lean Fxr deficient mice. However, the Fxr deficient mice displayed significantly increased liver weight, steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation together with elevated plasma levels of ALT, bilirubin and bile acids, findings compatible with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cholestasis. In conclusion, ageing Fxr deficient mice display late onset leanness associated with elevated energy expenditure and improved glucose control but develop severe NASH-like liver pathology. © 2013 Bjursell et al.},

abstract={Hunting live prey is risky and thought to require specialized adaptations. Therefore, observations of predatory cannibalism in otherwise non-carnivorous animals raise questions about its function, adaptive significance and evolutionary potential. Here we document predatory cannibalism on larger conspecifics in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and address its evolutionary significance. We found that under crowded laboratory conditions younger larvae regularly attack and consume 'wandering-stage' conspecifics, forming aggregations mediated by chemical cues from the attacked victim. Nutrition gained this way can be significant: an exclusively cannibalistic diet was sufficient for normal development from eggs to fertile adults. Cannibalistic diet also induced plasticity of larval mouth parts. Finally, during 118 generations of experimental evolution, replicated populations maintained under larval malnutrition evolved enhanced propensity towards cannibalism. These results suggest that, at least under laboratory conditions, predation on conspecifics in Drosophila is a functional, adaptive behaviour, which can rapidly evolve in response to nutritional conditions. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) confer multiple health benefits and decrease the risk of neurological disorders. Studies are needed, however, to identify promising cellular targets and to assess their prophylactic value against neurodegeneration. The present study (1) examined the efficacy of a preventive diet enriched with ω-3 PUFAs to reduce dysfunction in a well-established spinal cord injury (SCI) animal model and (2) used a novel metabolomics data analysis to identify potential neurolipidomic targets. Rats were fed with either control chow or chow enriched with ω-3 PUFAs (750 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks before being subjected to a sham or a contusion SCI operation. We report new evidence showing that rats subjected to SCI after being pre-treated with a diet enriched with ω-3 PUFAs exhibit significantly better functional outcomes. Pre-treated animals exhibited lower sensory deficits, autonomic bladder recovery, and early improvements in locomotion that persisted for at least 8 weeks after trauma. We found that SCI triggers a robust alteration in the cord PUFA neurolipidome, which was characterized by a marked docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency. This DHA deficiency was associated with dysfunction and corrected with the ω-3 PUFA-enriched diet. Multivariate data analyses revealed that the spinal cord of animals consuming the ω-3 PUFA-enriched diet had a fundamentally distinct neurolipidome, particularly increasing the levels of essential and long chain ω-3 fatty acids and lysolipids at the expense of ω-6 fatty acids and its metabolites. Altogether, dietary ω-3 PUFAs prophylaxis confers resiliency to SCI mediated, at least in part, by generating a neuroprotective and restorative neurolipidome. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.},

abstract={Group decisions on the timing of mutually exclusive activities pose a dilemma: monopolized decision-making by a single leader compromises the optimal timing of activities by the others, while independent decision-making by all group members undermines group coherence. Theory suggests that initiation of foraging should be determined by physiological demand in social foragers, thereby resolving the dilemma of group coordination. However, empirical support is scant, perhaps because intrinsic qualities predisposing individuals to leadership (social status, experience or personality), or their interactions with satiation level, have seldom been simultaneously considered. Here, we examine which females initiated foraging in eider (Somateria mollissima) brood-rearing coalitions, characterized by female dominance hierarchies and potentially large individual differences in energy requirements due to strenuous breeding effort. Several physiological and social factors, except for female breeding experience and boldness towards predators, explained foraging initiation. Initiators spent a larger proportion of time submerged during foraging bouts, had poorer body condition and smaller structural size, but they were also aggressive and occupied central positions. Initiation probability also declined with female group size as expected given random assignment of initiators. However, the relative importance of physiological predictors of leadership propensity (active foraging time, body condition, structural size) exceeded those of social predictors (aggressiveness, spatial position) by an order of magnitude. These results confirm recent theoretical work suggesting that 'leading according to need' is an evolutionary viable strategy regardless of group heterogeneity or underlying dominance structure. © 2013 Öst, Jaatinen.},

abstract={Background: Chemical cues provide aquatic organisms with sensory information that guides behavioural responses and thus interactions among themselves, each other and the environment. Chemical cues are considered important for predator avoidance, foraging, larval settlement and broadcast spawning in aquatic environments. However, the significance of their role as drivers of direct interactions between heterospecifics has been largely overlooked. Methodology/Principal Findings: A video camera and a demarcated arena were used in situ to record behavioural responses of three native gastropod species, Assiminea cf. capensis, Melanoides tuberculata and Coriandria durbanensis, exposed to treatments representing chemical cues released by a non-native invasive gastropod, Tarebia granifera. The responses were measured quantitatively as displacement and orientation of movement at locations in St Lucia Estuary, within the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the east coast of South Africa. All native gastropods exhibited a negative taxis response to chemical cues released by T. granifera, while T. granifera individuals responded randomly to conspecifics. Displacement was measured relative to the source of the extract, the number of steps taken were determined with path analysis and orientation was determined from the mean (±95% CIs) turning angles, with significant negative turning angles representing negative taxis. Responses to treatments corresponding to the environment and conspecifics were random and undirected, indicating kinesis.Conclusion/Significance: This study presents evidence for interactions driven by chemical cues between a non-native invasive gastropod and several gastropods native to South Africa. The results indicate that chemical cues can facilitate invasion success as the behavioural response of native gastropods is to move away allowing additional food and space resources to become available to T. granifera. © 2013 Raw et al.},

abstract={Background:Migration is an adaptive strategy that enables animals to enhance resource availability and reduce risk of predation at a broad geographic scale. Ungulate migrations generally occur along traditional routes, many of which have been disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances. Spring migration in ungulates is of particular importance for conservation planning, because it is closely coupled with timing of parturition. The degree to which oil and gas development affects migratory patterns, and whether ungulate migration is sufficiently plastic to compensate for such changes, warrants additional study to better understand this critical conservation issue.Methodology/Principal Findings:We studied timing and synchrony of departure from winter range and arrival to summer range of female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in northwestern Colorado, USA, which has one of the largest natural-gas reserves currently under development in North America. We hypothesized that in addition to local weather, plant phenology, and individual life-history characteristics, patterns of spring migration would be modified by disturbances associated with natural-gas extraction. We captured 205 adult female mule deer, equipped them with GPS collars, and observed patterns of spring migration during 2008-2010.Conclusions/Significance:Timing of spring migration was related to winter weather (particularly snow depth) and access to emerging vegetation, which varied among years, but was highly synchronous across study areas within years. Additionally, timing of migration was influenced by the collective effects of anthropogenic disturbance, rate of travel, distance traveled, and body condition of adult females. Rates of travel were more rapid over shorter migration distances in areas of high natural-gas development resulting in the delayed departure, but early arrival for females migrating in areas with high development compared with less-developed areas. Such shifts in behavior could have consequences for timing of arrival on birthing areas, especially where mule deer migrate over longer distances or for greater durations. © 2013 Lendrum et al.},

abstract={The evolution of male ornamentation often reflects compromises between sexual and natural selection, but it may also be influenced by phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the developmental plasticity of male colour ornamentation in Trinidadian guppies in response to two environmental variables that covary in nature: predation risk and food availability. We found that exposure to chemical predator cues delayed the development of pigment-based colour elements, which are conspicuous to visual-oriented predators. Predator cues also reduced the size of colour elements at the time of maturity and caused adult males to be less colourful. To the best of our knowledge, these findings provide the first example of a plastic reduction in the development of a sexually selected male ornament in response to predator cues. The influence of predator cues on ornamentation probably affects individual fitness by reducing conspicuousness to predators, but could reduce attractiveness to females. Reduced food availability during development caused males to delay the development of colour elements and mature later, probably reflecting a physiological constraint, but their coloration at maturity and later in adulthood was largely unaffected, suggesting that variation in food quantity without variation in quality does not contribute to condition dependence of the trait. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Adolescents spent significantly more time investigating the social stimulus than adults, although in the presence of the social stimulus isolate housed adults emitted more 50. kHz USVs than isolate housed adolescents. Isolate housed adults emitted more USVs to a social stimulus than adults that received less pre-test social isolation, a social deprivation effect not evident in the social approach data or any measure when animals were tested with a food stimulus. When tested with a food stimulus, adults emitted more 50. kHz USVs than adolescents, although they spent the same (or even less) time investigating that stimulus than did adolescents.

abstract={Maternal consumption of a high fat diet during pregnancy increases the offspring risk for obesity. Using a mouse model, we have previously shown that maternal consumption of a high fat (60%) diet leads to global and gene specific decreases in DNA methylation in the brain of the offspring. The present experiments were designed to attempt to reverse this DNA hypomethylation through supplementation of the maternal diet with methyl donors, and to determine whether methyl donor supplementation could block or attenuate phenotypes associated with maternal consumption of a HF diet. Metabolic and behavioral (fat preference) outcomes were assessed in male and female adult offspring. Expression of the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine transporter mRNA, as well as global DNA methylation were measured in the brain. Supplementation of the maternal diet with methyl donors attenuated the development of some of the adverse effects seen in offspring from dams fed a high fat diet; including weight gain, increased fat preference (males), changes in CNS gene expression and global hypomethylation in the prefrontal cortex. Notable sex differences were observed. These findings identify the importance of balanced methylation status during pregnancy, particularly in the context of a maternal high fat diet, for optimal offspring outcome. © 2013 Carlin et al.},

abstract={The zooplankter Daphnia exilis was found recently in reservoirs of central Chile. This species has been described as being tolerant to osmotic stress and chemical pollution, although the available information about its ecological properties is limited. Motivated by likelihood of being witnesses to a biological invasion, in this study we contribute to expand the knowledge of this exotic species through evaluating its ability to respond phenotypically to two major ecological factors: predation risk and food availability. Specifically, we analysed shifts in life-history and morphological traits of D. exilis in response to fish-released infochemicals, at different food densities. Our results revealed that the organisms were affected in their temporal trajectories of body size and shape, as well as in maturation time and fertility, in response to both predator cues and food availability. The presence of fish kairomones led to a decrease of age at maturity, and an increase of reproduction size and fecundity, especially at lower levels of resources. Our analyses indicated that asymptotic body size was affected only by food level, but the rate of increase in body size was sensitive to both fish kairomones and food level. The relative length of the tail spine decreased during early ontogenetic states, reaching a minimum around the age at maturity. This pattern was significantly enhanced in the presence of fish kairomones. However, our results did not match completely the typical responses of daphnids to fish kairomones. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and predation risk can favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity as a means of tracking changing environments. However, because food abundance and predation risk often covary in nature, few studies have separated their effects or tested whether different phenotypic traits respond to the same sources of environmental variation. We investigated patterns of parental investment and behavior over a 7-year period in 2 island populations of orange-crowned warblers (Oreothlypis celata) that showed little genetic divergence but experienced dramatic temporal variation in rainfall and spatial variation in nest predation risk. The amount of rainfall in each year was correlated with food abundance, and birds on both islands initiated breeding earlier and laid larger clutches in wetter years. In contrast, the rate at which parents visited their nests was not affected by rainfall but was negatively correlated with nest predation risk both within and between islands. Our results suggest that although the effects of food availability and nest predation have been viewed as mutually exclusive drivers of entire suites of life-history and behavioral traits, these traits can differ in their sensitivity to resource abundance or mortality risk, and traits that are often correlated can be decoupled under appropriate environmental conditions. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={Identifying how density and number-dependent processes regulate populations is important for predicting population response to environmental change. Species that live in groups, such as shoaling fish, can experience both direct density-dependent mortality through resource limitation and inverse number-dependent mortality via increased feeding rates and predator evasion in larger groups. To investigate the role of these processes in a temperate reef fish population, we manipulated the density and group size of the shoaling species Trachinops caudimaculatus on artificial patch reefs at two locations with different predator fields in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. We compared mortality over four weeks to estimates of predator abundance and per capita availability of refuge and food to identify mechanisms for density or number dependence. Mortality was strongly directly density dependent throughout the experiment, regardless of the dominant predator group; however, the limiting resource driving this effect changed over time. In the first two weeks when densities were highest, densitydependent mortality was best explained by refuge competition and the abundance of benthic predators. During the second two weeks, food competition best explained the pattern of mortality. We detected no effect of group size at either location, even where pelagic-predator abundance was high. Overall, direct density effects were much stronger than those of group size, suggesting little survival advantage to shoaling on isolated patch reefs where resource competition is high. This study is the first to observe a temporal shift in density-dependent mechanisms in reef fish, and the first to observe food limitation on short temporal scales. Food competition may therefore be an important regulator of postsettlement reef fish cohorts after the initial intense effects of refuge limitation and predation. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Early juvenile environments influence trait expression in complex and often nonintuitive ways. Although the breadth of these effects is well recognized, researchers generally focus on the effect of single ecological triggers (such as resource availability, latitude or predator presence) on traits within a single dimension (e.g. morphological, behavioural or physiological phenotypes). This approach has yielded a wealth of knowledge about environmental conditions that trigger different plastic allocation strategies and reaction norms of a number of traits. However, it tells us little about the way in which early life conditions influence resource allocation, yielding differentially integrated adult phenotypes. Here, I argue that we must begin to understand how complex environments shape the conditional development and expression of suites of traits to produce complex, adaptive phenotypes. I begin by examining the importance of the juvenile environment when attempting to understand phenotypic expression at later life history stages. I describe how different types of plasticity affect relationships between traits, and I provide four case studies that illustrate the influence of plasticity on trait integration, which strongly suggests that evolution of norms of reaction must be considered if we are to understand the evolution of integrated phenotypes. I next highlight the importance of understanding the physiological and genetic underpinnings of this plasticity because such poorly understood aspects of the phenotype regulate developmental pathways that determine phenotypic expression. I conclude with suggestions as to how future research can begin to accommodate multidimensional approaches, and in doing so, further our understanding of an integrated phenotype concept. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={A whole-farm, stochastic and dynamic simulation model was developed to predict biophysical and economic performance of grazing dairy systems. Several whole-farm models simulate grazing dairy systems, but most of them work at a herd level. This model, named e-Dairy, differs from the few models that work at an animal level, because it allows stochastic behaviour of the genetic merit of individual cows for several traits, namely, yields of milk, fat and protein, live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) within a whole-farm model. This model accounts for genetic differences between cows, is sensitive to genotype × environment interactions at an animal level and allows pasture growth, milk and supplements price to behave stochastically. The model includes an energy-based animal module that predicts intake at grazing, mammary gland functioning and body lipid change. This whole-farm model simulates a 365-day period for individual cows within a herd, with cow parameters randomly generated on the basis of the mean parameter values, defined as input and variance and co-variances from experimental data sets. The main inputs of e-Dairy are farm area, use of land, type of pasture, type of crops, monthly pasture growth rate, supplements offered, nutritional quality of feeds, herd description including herd size, age structure, calving pattern, BCS and LW at calving, probabilities of pregnancy, average genetic merit and economic values for items of income and costs. The model allows to set management policies to define: dry-off cows (ceasing of lactation), target pre- and post-grazing herbage mass and feed supplementation. The main outputs are herbage dry matter intake, annual pasture utilisation, milk yield, changes in BCS and LW, economic farm profit and return on assets. The model showed satisfactory accuracy of prediction when validated against two data sets from farmlet system experiments. Relative prediction errors were <10% for all variables, and concordance correlation coefficients over 0.80 for annual pasture utilisation, yields of milk and milk solids (MS; fat plus protein), and of 0.69 and 0.48 for LW and BCS, respectively. A simulation of two contrasting dairy systems is presented to show the practical use of the model. The model can be used to explore the effects of feeding level and genetic merit and their interactions for grazing dairy systems, evaluating the trade-offs between profit and the associated risk.

abstract={Summary: In insects, the length of larval development time typically influences adult body size and individual fitness, and hence development time can be expected to respond in an adaptive manner to variation in environmental conditions. In the wild, larval growth may be influenced by individual condition, which can be affected by population-level parameters such as population density and abundance and quality of resources. We sampled larvae of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) from 514 local populations across a large metapopulation before the winter diapause and reared the larvae in common garden conditions after diapause. Here, we report that small post-diapause larvae prolonged their development via an extra larval instar, apparently to compensate for their 'bad start' after diapause. The number of instars was additionally a plastic response to environmental conditions, as the frequency of the extra instar increased under cooler thermal conditions. The benefit of the extra instar is clear, as it allows individuals to develop into larger adults, but the cost is delayed adult eclosion, which is likely to select against the extra instar especially in males, in which early eclosion is critical for mating success. In support of this, the frequency of the extra instar was significantly lower in males (7%) than in females (42%). Polymorphisms in three genes, serpin-1, vitellin-degrading protease precursor and phosphoglucose isomerase, which are known to influence development in insects, were associated with the occurrence of the extra instar. At the level of local populations, the frequency of the extra instar was higher in newly established populations than that in old local ones, possibly reflecting maternal effects, as new populations are often established by females with heavy investment in dispersal. The frequency of the extra instar in turn correlated with the change in population size over 1 year and the risk of local extinction in the natural metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary. Our results highlight the importance of the physiological condition of individuals in shaping subsequent life-history events and even population dynamics. A central goal of population and evolutionary biology is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how environmental variation affects individual fitness and population and evolutionary dynamics in natural populations. This study makes an important contribution in this context in indicating the importance of developmental plasticity in individual development and how this may interact with population dynamics. © 2013 British Ecological Society823 May 2013 10.1111/1365-2656.12034 Standard Paper Life histories © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={A population of dice snakes (Natrix tessellata) monitored since 2008 in a small island (18. ha, 850. m a.s.l., FYR of Macedonia) revealed unforeseen patterns for snakes living in temperate climates. More than 5000 individuals have been marked and the density is one of the highest ever recorded (>500 resident snakes per hectare). Reproductive and mortality rates are elevated, suggesting a high population turnover. These traits evoke a tropical rather than a temperate-climate ophidian demographic system. The population is highly polymorphic, three colour morphs (dotted, grey, and black) are observed in both sexes and each morph is represented by large numbers of individuals. This polymorphism pattern was not previously documented in snakes. Data obtained for other life history traits (e.g. body size, size at maturity, clutch size, diet, predation) markedly diverged in comparison to available information. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that the strong inter-population variability (often mediated by phenotypic plasticity) of snakes should be taken into account over large geographic scales; otherwise attempts to derive general patterns may well be strongly biased. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperamental tendency to avoid or withdraw from novel social and nonsocial situations, and has been shown to predispose individuals to anxiety disorders. However, adequate means to assess individual differences in avoidance learning in humans are presently limited. Here, we tested whether individuals with high self-reported BI show faster associative learning on a purely cognitive task and whether such inhibited individuals are more prone to avoid aversive outcomes. In Experiment 1, we tested 74 healthy undergraduate students (mean age 19.5 years; 55.4% female) on a computer-based probabilistic classification task, where participants were asked to classify four distinct visual stimuli into two categories. Two stimuli were associated with reward (point gain) and two were associated with punishment (point loss). In Experiment 2, 79 participants from the same population (mean age 19.8 years; 62% female) were tested on a novel modification of the same task, where they also had the option to opt out of responding on each trial, thus avoiding any chance of being punished (or rewarded) on that trial. Results show that inhibited participants demonstrated better associative learning in Experiment 1, while exhibiting a greater tendency to opt out in Experiment 2 (repeated-measures analysis of variance, main effects of BI, both p < 0.05). These results indicate that the facilitated classically conditioned learning previously observed in inhibited individuals can be extended to a cognitive task, and also highlight a specific preference in inhibited individuals for withdrawal ("opting out") as a response strategy, when multiple strategies are available to avoid punishment. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and serious condition in the elderly. AF affects between 600,000 and one million patients in France, two-thirds of whom are aged above 75 years. AF is a predictive factor for mortality in the elderly and a major risk factor for stroke. Co-morbidities are frequent and worsen the prognosis. The management of AF in the elderly should involve a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), which analyses both medical and psychosocial elements, enabling evaluation of the patient's functional status and social situation and the identification of co-morbidities. The CGA enables the detection of "frailty" using screening tools assessing cognitive function, risk of falls, nutritional status, mood disorders, autonomy and social environment. The objectives of AF treatment in the elderly are to prevent AF complications, particularly stroke, and improve quality of life. Specific precautions for treatment must be taken because of the co-morbidities and age-related changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Preventing AF complications relies mainly on anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulants are recommended in patients with AF aged 75 years or above after assessing the bleeding risk using the HEMORR2HAGES or HAS-BLED scores. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are promising treatments, especially due to a lower risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. However, their prescriptions should take into account renal function (creatinine clearance assessed with Cockcroft formula) and cognitive function (for adherence to treatment). Studies including frail patients in "real life" are necessary to evaluate tolerance of NOACs. Management of AF also involves the treatment of underlying cardiomyopathy and heart rate control rather than a rhythm-control strategy as first-line therapy for elderly patients, especially if they are paucisymptomatic. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be used carefully in elderly patients because of the frequency of metabolic abnormalities and higher risk of drug interactions and bradycardia. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Background. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common among patients admitted to general hospitals. Unfortunately, AUDs often go undetected and untreated. Psychiatrists are frequently called upon to assist in the management of cases involving alcohol withdrawal. However, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding potential therapeutic approachesto AUDs beyond the acute withdrawal stage. Objective. This article presents an overviewof the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of AUDs on medical wards, with a specific focus on the post alcoholwithdrawal phase. Method. This article is based on a survey of the published literature on AUDs and their treatment in the medical ward using the PubMed database. Results. Various screening tools are available to facilitate the detection of AUDs. Among non-medically ill patients, brief psychological interventions have proven to be effective in primary care and emergency room settings, while pharmacotherapy has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse. Existing data on the implementation of these interventions in the general hospital setting remain scarce. Conclusion. Current evidence suggests the need for additional research in this area with a view toward clarifying AUD treatment guidelines for medically ill inpatients. The hospital stay could provide a valuable opportunity to initiate interventions for AUDs with medically ill patients, leading to significant changes in alcohol use behaviors and betterhealth-related outcomes. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 2013.},

abstract={On 9 June 2008, the UK's largest mass stranding event (MSE) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) occurred in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall. At least 26 dolphins died, and a similar number was refloated/herded back to sea. On necropsy, all dolphins were in good nutritive status with empty stomachs and no evidence of known infectious disease or acute physical injury. Auditory tissues were grossly normal (26/26) but had microscopic haemorrhages (5/5) and mild otitis media (1/5) in the freshest cases. Five lactating adult dolphins, one immature male, and one immature female tested were free of harmful algal toxins and had low chemical pollutant levels. Pathological evidence of mud/seawater inhalation (11/26), local tide cycle, and the relative lack of renal myoglobinuria (26/26) suggested MSE onset on a rising tide between 06:30 and 08:21 hrs (9 June). Potential causes excluded or considered highly unlikely included infectious disease, gas/fat embolism, boat strike, by-catch, predator attack, foraging unusually close to shore, chemical or algal toxin exposure, abnormal weather/climatic conditions, and high-intensity acoustic inputs from seismic airgun arrays or natural sources (e.g., earthquakes). International naval exercises did occur in close proximity to the MSE with the most intense part of the exercises (including mid-frequency sonars) occurring four days before the MSE and resuming with helicopter exercises on the morning of the MSE. The MSE may therefore have been a "two-stage process" where a group of normally pelagic dolphins entered Falmouth Bay and, after 3-4 days in/around the Bay, a second acoustic/disturbance event occurred causing them to strand en masse. This spatial and temporal association with the MSE, previous associations between naval activities and cetacean MSEs, and an absence of other identifiable factors known to cause cetacean MSEs, indicates naval activity to be the most probable cause of the Falmouth Bay MSE. © 2013 Jepson et al.},

abstract={Significance: Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are classified as two distinct diseases. However, accumulating evidence shows that both disorders share genetic, pathological, and epidemiological characteristics. Based on genetic and functional findings, redox dysregulation due to an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defense mechanisms has been proposed as a risk factor contributing to their pathophysiology. Recent Advances: Altered antioxidant systems and signs of increased oxidative stress are observed in peripheral tissues and brains of SZ and BD patients, including abnormal prefrontal levels of glutathione (GSH), the major cellular redox regulator and antioxidant. Here we review experimental data from rodent models demonstrating that permanent as well as transient GSH deficit results in behavioral, morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical alterations analogous to pathologies observed in patients. Mice with GSH deficit display increased stress reactivity, altered social behavior, impaired prepulse inhibition, and exaggerated locomotor responses to psychostimulant injection. These behavioral changes are accompanied by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction, elevated glutamate levels, impairment of parvalbumin GABA interneurons, abnormal neuronal synchronization, altered dopamine neurotransmission, and deficient myelination. Critical Issues: Treatment with the GSH precursor and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine normalizes some of those deficits in mice, but also improves SZ and BD symptoms when given as adjunct to antipsychotic medication. Future Directions: These data demonstrate the usefulness of GSH-deficient rodent models to identify the mechanisms by which a redox imbalance could contribute to the development of SZ and BD pathophysiologies, and to develop novel therapeutic approaches based on antioxidant and redox regulator compounds.

abstract={To identify herd management and cow characteristics associated with the reproductive success of cow-calf herds in Western Canada, 33,391 beef cows were followed from the beginning of the breeding season in 2001 through pregnancy testing in 2002. Breeding management and cow-level risk factors such as age, body condition score (BCS), and previous reproductive history, were measured through a series of herd visits by project personnel and records maintained by the herd owner. Pregnancy status was measured in 205 herds in the fall of 2001 and again in 200 herds in the fall of 2002. Cows least likely to be pregnant in the fall of the year were 10 years old or older, exposed to a bull less than 84 days, had a BCS ≤5 of 9 at pregnancy testing, <5 of 9 before calving, and lost condition between calving and the start of the breeding season, or had a prebreeding BCS <5 of 9 with a loss of condition between breeding and pregnancy testing. Other factors identified that decreased the likelihood of pregnancy in at least one of the 2 years included being a heifer or being a cow exposed to breeding after her first calf, and using a single bull on breeding pasture. Cows vaccinated for bovine viral diarrhea virus and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bred on community pastures were more likely to be pregnant than cows that were not vaccinated and bred on community pastures. Cows bred on community pastures that were not vaccinated were also less likely to be pregnant than cows that were not on community pastures regardless of vaccination status. Calving-associated events such as twin birth, Cesarean section or malpresentation, problems such as uterine prolapse or retained placentas, abortion or calf death within 1 hour after birth, or calving late after the start of the breeding season, were also associated with fewer pregnancies after accounting for all other factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Voltage-gated ion channels are essential for electrical signaling in neurons and other excitable cells. Among them, voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels are four-domain proteins, and ion selectivity is strongly influenced by a ring of amino acids in the pore regions of these channels. Sodium channels contain a DEKA motif (i.e., amino acids D, E, K, and A at the pore positions of domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively), whereas voltage-gated calcium channels contain an EEEE motif (i.e., acidic residues, E, at all four positions). Recently, a novel family of ion channel proteins that contain an intermediate DEEA motif has been found in a variety of invertebrate species. However, the physiological role of this new family of ion channels in animal biology remains elusive. DSC1 in Drosophila melanogaster is a prototype of this new family of ion channels. In this study, we generated two DSC1 knockout lines using ends-out gene targeting via homologous recombination. DSC1 mutant flies exhibited impaired olfaction and a distinct jumpy phenotype that is intensified by heat shock and starvation. Electrophysiological analysis of the giant fiber system (GFS), a well-defined central neural circuit, revealed that DSC1 mutants are altered in the activities of the GFS, including the ability of the GFS to follow repetitive stimulation (i.e., following ability) and response to heat shock, starvation, and pyrethroid insecticides. These results reveal an important role of the DSC1 channel in modulating the stability of neural circuits, particularly under environmental stresses, likely by maintaining the sustainability of synaptic transmission. © 2013 Zhang et al.},

abstract={l-Lysine (Lys) is an essential amino acid and plays an important role in anxiogenic behaviour in both human subjects and rodents. Previous studies have shown the existence of neural plasticity between the Lys-deficient state and the normal state. Lys deficiency causes an increase in noradrenaline release from the hypothalamus and serotonin release from the amygdala in rats. However, no studies have used functional MRI (fMRI) to compare the brain response to ingested Lys in normal, Lys-deficient and Lys-recovered states. Therefore, in the present study, using acclimation training, we performed fMRI on conscious rats to investigate the brain response to an intragastric load of Lys. The brain responses to intragastric administration of Lys (3 mmol/kg body weight) were investigated in six rats intermittently in three states: normal, Lys-deficient and recovered state. First, in the normal state, an intragastric load of Lys activated several brain regions, including the raphe pallidus nucleus, prelimbic cortex and the ventral/lateral orbital cortex. Then, after 6 d of Lys deprivation from the normal state, an intragastric load of Lys activated the ventral tegmental area, raphe pallidus nucleus and hippocampus, as well as several hypothalamic areas. After recovering from the Lys-deficient state, brain activation was similar to that in the normal state. These results indicate that neural plasticity in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamic area and limbic system is related to the internal Lys state and that this plasticity could have important roles in the control of Lys intake.

abstract={Non-consumptive effects of predators on each other and on prey populations often exceed the effects of direct predation. These effects can arise from fear responses elevating glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels (predator stress hypothesis) or from increased vigilance that reduces foraging efficiency and body condition (predator sensitive foraging hypothesis); both responses can lead to immunosuppression and increased parasite loads. Non-consumptive effects of invasive predators have been little studied, even though their direct impacts on local species are usually greater than those of their native counterparts. To address this issue, we explored the non-consumptive effects of the invasive red fox Vulpes vulpes on two native species in eastern Australia: a reptilian predator, the lace monitor Varanus varius and a marsupial, the ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. In particular, we tested predictions derived from the above two hypotheses by comparing the basal glucocorticoid levels, foraging behaviour, body condition and haemoparasite loads of both native species in areas with and without fox suppression. Lace monitors showed no GC response or differences in haemoparasite loads but were more likely to trade safety for higher food rewards, and had higher body condition, in areas of fox suppression than in areas where foxes remained abundant. In contrast, ringtails showed no physiological or behavioural differences between fox-suppressed and control areas. Predator sensitive foraging is a non-consumptive cost for lace monitors in the presence of the fox and most likely represents a response to competition. The ringtail's lack of response to the fox potentially represents complete naiveté or strong and rapid selection to the invasive predator. We suggest evolutionary responses are often overlooked in interactions between native and introduced species, but must be incorporated if we are to understand the suite of forces that shape community assembly and function in the wake of biological invasions. © 2013 Anson et al.},

abstract={Background: The flower bug Orius sauteri is an important polyphagous predator that is widely used for the biological control of mites and aphids. However, the optimal conditions for mass rearing of this insect are still unclear, thus limiting its application. Methodology: In this study, we investigated the optimal ingredients of an artificial diet for raising O. sauteri using a microencapsulation technique. The ingredients included egg yolk (vitellus), whole-pupa homogenate of the Tussah silk moth (Antheraea paphia), honey, sucrose, rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen and sinkaline. We tested 25 combinations of the above ingredients using an orthogonal experimental design. Using statistical analysis, we confirmed the main effect factors amongst the components, and selected five optimal combinations based on different biological and physiological characters. Principal Findings: The results showed that, although different artificial diet formats significantly influenced the development and reproductive ability of O. sauteri, the complete development of O. sauteri to sexual maturity could only be achieved by optimizing the artificial diet according to specific biological characters. In general, pupae of A. paphia had more influence on O sauteri development than did artificial components. The results of a follow-up test of locomotory and respiratory capacity indicated that respiratory quotient, metabolic rate and average creeping speed were all influenced by different diets. Furthermore, the field evaluations of mating preference, predatory consumption and population dispersion also demonstrated the benefits that could be provided by optimal artificial diets. Conclusions: A microencapsulated artificial diet overcame many of the difficulties highlighted by previous studies on the mass rearing of O. sauteri. Optimization of the microencapsulated artificial diet directly increased the biological and physiological characters investigated. Successive physiological tests and field investigations were used to evaluate the outcome of different artificial diet combinations on the quality of the reared O. sauteri. © 2013 Tan et al.},

abstract={Alcoholism has always been emphasized in literature, narratives, and theater as its prevalence and related disability are very high, is found throughout the world, and affects women and men of all ages and social classes. There is a tragic or romantic fascination in the deep sense of personal failure that drinking is able to relieve and in the uncontrollable inability to stop drinking. These aspects have been portrayed well by fictional alcoholics in movies and novels. It has become evident that biological traits together with a complex series of psychosocial factors (e.g. negative life events, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric or personality disorders), which are also well represented in novels and movies, can lead to alcohol addiction. Behavioral (euphoria, disinhibiting behaviors, aggressiveness) and neurological changes (confusion, bradypsychism, slurred speech, ataxia, blackouts) related to alcohol intoxication are also well portrayed by fictional characters. Delirium tremens, epilepsy, alcohol dementia, and Wernicke-Korsakoff disease, however, find less representation in literature and on the stage and screen. The treatment of alcoholic dependence is very difficult (as often reported by fictional and real stories), but should never be considered hopeless. It should be initiated at any stage of the disease. The support offered by Alcoholics Anonymous has always had great appeal for the public. Fictional works can portray alcohol addiction superbly and show some dark sides of human nature (negative emotions and autodestructive thoughts and behaviors), and, at the same time, the severity and pervasiveness of mental illnesses. The psychiatric and psychosocial aspects of alcohol addiction in movies and novels could be an inspiring source for new psychological studies and rehabilitation programs. © 2013 S.

abstract={The Zucker rat is used as a model of genetic obesity, and while Zucker rats have been well studied for their reduced sensitivity to leptin signaling and subsequent weight gain, little work has examined their responses to environmental signals that are associated with "hedonic" feeding. This study evaluated the effects of a high-fat food olfactory cue (bacon) in stimulating nose-poke food-seeking behavior on first exposure (novel) and after a period of access for consumption (familiar) in lean and obese Zucker rats at either 4 or 12 months of age, and under ad-lib fed (unrestricted; U) or chronically food-restricted (70% of ad-lib; R) conditions. Baseline nose-poke levels were comparable amongst all groups. At 4 months of age, only ObU rats displayed increased behavioral activation to familiar food cues. Twelve-month-old Ob rats, regardless of diet, exhibited substantially greater food-seeking behavior when exposed to both the novel and familiar olfactory cues. A strong positive correlation between body weight and nose-poke entries for the familiar food cue was observed at both ages, while this correlation for the novel food cue was significant in 12-month-old rats only. Similarly, there were strong positive correlations between food intake and poke entries for the familiar food cue was observed at both ages, while this correlation for the novel food cue was significant in 12-month-old rats only. Although it is possible that differences in olfactory sensitivity contribute to these behavioral effects, our findings support the interactions between food intake, obesity, and food-seeking behavior and are consistent with leptin inhibiting the brain's reactivity to food cues and suggest that the enhanced sensitivity to the food cues with leptin deficiency is likely to contribute to overeating and weight gain. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Heterogeneous forces of selection associated with fluctuating environments are recognized as important factors involved in the maintenance of inter-individual phenotypic variance within populations. Consistent behavioural differences over time and across situations (e.g. personality) are increasingly cited as examples of individual variation observed within populations. However, the suggestion that heterogeneous selective pressures target different animal personalities remains largely untested in the wild. In this 5-year study, we investigated the dynamics of viability selection on a personality trait, exploration, in a population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) experiencing substantial seasonal variations in weather conditions and food availability associated with masting trees. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence of fluctuating selection on exploration. Instead, we found strong disruptive viability selection on adult exploration behaviour, independent of seasonal variations. Individuals with either low or high exploration scores were almost twice as likely to survive over a 6-month period compared with individuals with intermediate scores. We found no evidence of viability selection on juvenile exploration. Our results highlight that disruptive selection might play an important role in the maintenance of phenotypic variance of wild populations through its effect on different personality types across temporally varying environmental conditions. © 2013 The Authors.

Lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient were fed rodent meals of three different sizes (5, 10, or 20- of body mass), or sham fed (meal of 0- body mass), and Tbs were recorded for three days before feeding and seven days after feeding. Gila monsters selected a mean Tb of 25.2°C while fasting (set-point range 23.6-27.1), and increased Tbs after feeding. The magnitude and duration of post-prandial Tb increases are positively related to meal size, and Gila monsters selected mean Tbs up to 3.0°C higher and maintain elevated Tbs for 3-6 days after feeding. Selection of Tb does not appear to differ between day and night time periods, and because the lizards are both diurnal and nocturnal (at different times of year), photoperiod may not be an important influence on Tb selection. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Prey often suffer foraging costs associated with antipredator behaviours such as vigilance. Migration is one behaviour in ungulates that can lead to trade-offs between forage acquisition and predator avoidance. However, when forage intake is limited by food-handling time rather than by food encounter rate, ungulates can reduce foraging costs by synchronizing vigilance with chewing (multitasking). In this study, we compared patterns of vigilance, frequency of multitasking and total foraging time between migrant and resident individuals in a partially migratory elk, Cervus canadensis, population while they were together on their sympatric winter range. We used these comparisons to determine whether one herd segment had an advantage over the other in terms of forage intake and predator avoidance. Using observations of focal individuals, we found that residents were better than migrants at adjusting vigilance levels to spatial variation in wolf, Canis lupus, predation risk associated with a human-caused predation refuge. Migrant elk were less vigilant than residents where wolf predation risk was highest. Residents probably had an advantage over migrants because they were better at mitigating the foraging costs of vigilance by synchronizing vigilance with chewing. Migrant elk did not compensate for higher foraging costs by altering total activity time. Our study shows how foraging behaviours of free-ranging ungulates might contribute to demographic differences that lead to the loss of migratory behaviours. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an important risk factor for the development of type-2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. We aimed to compare the MetS prevalence in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) with comparison subjects followed in primary care from a similar region. One hundred and thirty-five BPD patients according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were compared to 1009 subjects from primary care. We used the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute criteria to determine the rate of MetS. The age-standardized prevalence of MetS was more than double in patients with BPD compared to comparison subjects (23.3 vs. 10.6 %, p < 0.05). Regarding individual MetS criteria, hyperglycemia was significantly more prevalent in both genders (p < 0.05). Abdominal obesity (p < 0.05) and hypertriglyceridemia (p < 0.05) were significantly higher only in women with BPD. Within BPD patients, an increased rate of MetS was associated with higher BMI (p = 0.004), age (p = 0.03), treatment with second-generation antipsychotics (quetiapine, olanzapine and clozapine; p = 0.032), dysthymia (p = 0.031), panic disorder (p = 0.032), benzodiazepine dependency (p = 0.015) and binge eating disorder p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate an increased MetS rate, dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with BPD.

We tested the hypothesis that plastic changes in morphology (and their effect on performance) and life history of developing Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens (Schreber, 1782)) larvae vary when exposed to cues of fish predators fed different diets. During development, we exposed tadpoles to control cues, cues from brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus (Lesueur, 1819)) fed trout pellets, or cues from A. nebulosus fed L. pipiens tadpoles. Tadpoles exposed to predatory fish cues had smaller bodies, deeper tail fins, slower growth and development rates, and better turning performance than tadpoles that were not exposed to predatory fish cues, but we found limited evidence that the predator's diet had an effect on phenotypic plasticity. Predator diet affected tail morphology and activity, but the latter effect was only marginally significant. Lithobates pipiens tadpoles clearly respond to predatory fish cues, but it remains unclear whether their response is modulated by the predator's diet.},

abstract={The endogenous opioid enkephalins (ENK) are highly expressed in the central nucleus of the amygdaloid complex (CeA) where several lines of evidence point to a potential role in the modulation of fear and anxiety. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of CeA ENK using local injections of a lentiviral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting ENK in Sprague-Dawley rats. We injected this vector in the CeA and a 56% downregulation of ENK mRNA was observed in animals when compared with scrambled shRNA animals. Anxiety-like behaviors were also assessed using the elevated plus maze and social interaction test. There was an increase in exploration of open arms of the elevated plus maze in ENK knockdown animals compared with controls, but no change in social interaction. In addition, we used the contextual fear conditioning procedure to assess fear expression and learning in these animals. There was a reduction in freezing induced by acute shocks during the training procedure. Interestingly, associative learning was not affected, and ENK knockdown animals displayed an equivalent freezing when re-exposed to the conditioning chamber 48 h later. These results contrast with knockout mice studies, which ascribed anxiolytic properties to ENK, and they demonstrate the need for a thorough understanding and characterization of neuroanatomically distinct ENK pathways. © 2013 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Background aims: The use of adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) in cellular and genic therapy has attracted considerable attention as a possible treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease. However, the effects of gene therapy combined with intracerebral cell transplantation have not been well defined. Recent studies have demonstrated the respective roles of LIM homeobox transcription factor 1, alpha (LMX1A) and Neurturin (NTN) in the commitment of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to a midbrain dopaminergic neuronal fate and the commitment of mesenchymal stromal cells to cells supporting the nutrition and protection of neurons. Methods: We investigated a novel in vitro neuronal differentiation strategy with the use of LMX1A and Neurturin. We were able to elicit a neural phenotype regarding cell morphology, specific gene/protein expression and physiological function. Neuronal-primed ASCs derived from rhesus monkey (rASCs) combined with adenovirus containing NTN and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Ad-NTN-TH) were implanted into the striatum and substantia nigra of methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned hemi-parkinsonian rhesus monkeys. Monkeys were monitored with the use of behavioral tests and health measures until the fourth month after implantation. Results: The differentiated cells transcribed and expressed a variety of dopaminergic neuron-specific genes involved in the SHH/LMX1A pathway. Single-photon emission computed tomography analysis and postmortem analysis revealed that the grafting of rASCs combined with Ad-NTN-TH had neuroprotective effects compared with Ad-NTN-TH or rASCs alone. Behavioral measures demonstrated autograft survival and symptom amelioration. Conclusions: These findings may lead to cellular sources for autologous transplantation of Parkinson disease. Combined transplantation of Ad-NTN-TH and induced rASCs expressing LMX1A and NTN may be a better therapy candidate for the treatment of Parkinson disease.},

abstract={Objectives: Eating behaviors and obesity are complex phenotypes influenced by genes and the environment, but few studies have investigated the interaction of these two variables. The purpose of this study was to use a gene-environment interaction model to test for differences in children's food acceptance and body weights. Design and Methods: Inherited ability to taste 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) was assessed as a marker of oral taste responsiveness. Food environment was classified as "healthy" or "unhealthy" based on proximity to outlets that sell fruits/vegetables and fast foods using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The cohort consisted of 120 children, ages 4-6 years, recruited from New York City over 2005-2010. Home address and other demographic variables were reported by parents and PROP status, food acceptance, and anthropometrics were assessed in the laboratory. Based on a screening test, children were classified as PROP tasters or non-tasters. Hierarchical linear models analysis of variance was performed to examine differences in food acceptance and body mass index (BMI) z-scores as a function of PROP status, the food environment ("healthy" vs. "unhealthy"), and their interaction. Results and Conclusion: Results showed an interaction between taster status and the food environment on BMI z-score and food acceptance. Non-taster children living in healthy food environments had greater acceptance of vegetables than taster children living in healthy food environments (P ≤ 0.005). Moreover, non-tasters from unhealthy food environments had higher BMI z-scores than all other groups (P ≤ 0.005). Incorporating genetic markers of taste into studies that assess the built environment may improve the ability of these measures to predict risk for obesity and eating behaviors.

abstract={The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is commonly used to assess risky decision making in clinical and non-clinical populations, and negative mood and various personality characteristics have been shown to affect the number of advantageous and disadvantageous selections on this task. Recent research has suggested that IGT data should be analyzed at the individual deck level due to differences in frequency and magnitude of losses, and the present study examined how personality characteristics and state mood may affect deck level selections on this task. Participants were 91 undergraduate students (38 male) who completed measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking, behavioral activation and inhibition, state mood, and the computerized IGT. Results indicated that negative mood, drive, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were all positively correlated with Deck B selections, but negatively correlated with Deck D selections. No differences emerged in correlations between Decks A and B or Decks A and D. Results indicate that mood and personality characteristics differentially relate to selections from the individual decks on the IGT. Results have implications for the assessment of decision making, as personality and fluctuations in state-dependent mood could mimic pathological risk-taking if analysis is conducted on the combined decks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: Child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems are common and serious all over the world and are linked to pre-mature deaths and serious dysfunction in adult life. Effective interventions have been developed in high income countries (HIC), but evidence from low income settings is scarce and scattered. The aim of this paper is to identify the most promising interventions in the area of global CAMH. Method: A systematic review of all randomised controlled trials in CAMH in low and middle income countries (LAMIC) was carried out and supplemented by 1a level evidence from HIC as well as suitable information from child programme evaluations and adult studies in LAMIC. Results: In behavioural disorders parent training is a highly promising intervention, which can successfully improve children's compliance and bring down rates of conduct problems significantly. In young children cognitive, emotional and behavioural development can be enhanced through nutritional supplements and by stimulation through play, praise and reading. Trauma treatments can bring positive results even in severely traumatised children, who remain in unstable living conditions. In developmental disorders, there are successful prevention strategies as well as programmes that bring children out of isolation and improve their independence. Some classroom-based interventions for adolescents have reduced symptoms of common mental disorders as well as risk taking behaviours. Conclusions: While many results are still tentative the evidence suggests that it is possible to develop affordable and feasible interventions that significantly improve the lives of affected children, their families and their communities around the world. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study (AGHLS) is a unique, multidisciplinary cohortstudy that was initially set up to examine growth and health among teenagers. Throughout the years, the AGHLS has aimed to answer research questions dealing with the relationships between the (natural) development of anthropometry, lifestyle and health from adolescence into adulthood. The AGHLS specifically focuses on anthropometrics, physical activity and fitness, cardiovascular disease risk, lifestyle, musculoskeletal health, psychological health and well-being. Besides this, many methodological issues related to the analysis of longitudinal data were also explored within the framework of the AGHLS. In 1976, students from two secondary schools from the greater Amsterdam area were included in the study. Between 1976 and 2006, 10 rounds of measurement were performed covering an age range between 13 and 43 years. The huge database collected so far has been primarily used to answer relevant research questions regarding the longitudinal relationship between lifestyle and health.

abstract={Shifts in the diet of top predators can be linked to changes in environmental conditions. In this study, we tested relationships between environmental variation and seasonal changes in diet of a top predator, the grey-headed albatross Thalassarche chrysostoma, breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia in an austral summer of 1999/2000. Oceanographic conditions in that year around South Georgia were abnormal (i.e. anomalously high sea surface temperature to a relative 19-year long-term mean). The diet of grey-headed albatrosses showed high seasonal variation, shifting from cephalopods (42.9 % by mass) in late February to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (58.3 %) in late April, and grey-headed albatrosses breeding performance was low (16.8 %). This study shows these albatrosses did not manage to find sufficient alternative prey and highlight the risk to top predators if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of food shortages in Antarctic waters. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Tissue analysis is commonly used in ecology and agronomy to portray plant nutrient signatures. Nutrient concentration data, or ionomes, belong to the compositional data class, i.e., multivariate data that are proportions of some whole, hence carrying important numerical properties. Statistics computed across raw or ordinary log-transformed nutrient data are intrinsically biased, hence possibly leading to wrong inferences. Our objective was to present a sound and robust approach based on a novel nutrient balance concept to classify plant ionomes. We analyzed leaf N, P, K, Ca, and Mg of two wild and six domesticated fruit species from Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand sampled during reproductive stages. Nutrient concentrations were (1) analyzed without transformation, (2) ordinary log-transformed as commonly but incorrectly applied in practice, (3) additive log-ratio (alr) transformed as surrogate to stoichiometric rules, and (4) converted to isometric log-ratios (ilr) arranged as sound nutrient balance variables. Raw concentration and ordinary log transformation both led to biased multivariate analysis due to redundancy between interacting nutrients. The alr- and ilr-transformed data provided unbiased discriminant analyses of plant ionomes, where wild and domesticated species formed distinct groups and the ionomes of species and cultivars were differentiated without numerical bias. The ilr nutrient balance concept is preferable to alr, because the ilr technique projects the most important interactions between nutrients into a convenient Euclidean space. This novel numerical approach allows rectifying historical biases and supervising phenotypic plasticity in plant nutrition studies. © 2013 Parent, Parent, Egozcue, Rozane, Hernandes, Lapointe, Hébert-Gentile, Naess, Marchand, Lafond, Mattos Jr, Barlow and Natale.},

abstract={Considerable evidence links many neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders with multiple complex interactions between genetics and environmental factors such as nutrition. Mental health problems, autism, eating disorders, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and brain tumours are related to individual variability in numerous protein-coding and non-coding regions of the genome. However, genotype does not necessarily determine neurological phenotype because the epigenome modulates gene expression in response to endogenous and exogenous regulators, throughout the life-cycle. Studies using both genome-wide analysis of multiple genes and comprehensive analysis of specific genes are providing new insights into genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying nutrition and neuroscience. This review provides a critical evaluation of the following related areas: (1) recent advances in genomic and epigenomic technologies, and their relevance to brain disorders; (2) the emerging role of non-coding RNAs as key regulators of transcription, epigenetic processes and gene silencing; (3) novel approaches to nutrition, epigenetics and neuroscience; (4) gene-environment interactions, especially in the serotonergic system, as a paradigm of the multiple signalling pathways affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Current and future advances in these four areas should contribute significantly to the prevention, amelioration and treatment of multiple devastating brain disorders. © 2013 by the author.},

abstract={Steroid hormones, including those produced by the gonads and the adrenal glands, are known to influence brain development during sensitive periods of life. Until recently, most brain organisation was assumed to take place during early stages of development, with relatively little neurogenesis or brain re-organisation during later stages. However, an increasing body of research has shown that the developing brain is also sensitive to steroid hormone exposure during adolescence (broadly defined as the period from nutritional independence to sexual maturity). In this review, we examine how steroid hormones that are produced by the gonads and adrenal glands vary across the lifespan in a range of mammalian and bird species, and we summarise the evidence that steroid hormone exposure influences behavioural and brain development during early stages of life and during adolescence in these two taxonomic groups. Taking a cross-species, comparative perspective reveals that the effects of early exposure to steroid hormones depend upon the stage of development at birth or hatching, as measured along the altricial-precocial dimension. We then review the evidence that exposure to stress during adolescence impacts upon the developing neuroendocrine systems, the brain and behaviour. Current research suggests that the effects of adolescent stress vary depending upon the sex of the individual and type of stressor, and the effects of stress could involve several neural systems, including the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Experience of stressors during adolescence could also influence brain development via the close interactions between the stress hormone and gonadal hormone axes. While sensitivity of the brain to steroid hormones during early life and adolescence potentially leaves the developing organism vulnerable to external adversities, developmental plasticity also provides an opportunity for the developing organism to respond to current circumstances and for behavioural responses to influence the future life history of the individual. © 2013 IBRO.},

abstract={Epidemiological evidence suggests that low levels of vitamin D may predispose people to develop depression and cognitive impairment. While rodent studies have demonstrated that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with altered brain development, there is a lack of research examining adult vitamin D (AVD) deficiency. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of AVD deficiency on behaviour and brain function in the mouse. Ten-week old male C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice were fed a control or vitamin D deficient diet for 10 weeks prior to, and during behavioural testing. We assessed a broad range of behavioural domains, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in brain tissue, and, in separate groups of mice, locomotor response to d-amphetamine and MK-801. Overall, AVD deficiency resulted in hyperlocomotion in a novel open field and reduced GAD65/67 levels in brain tissue. AVD-deficient BALB/c mice had altered behaviour on the elevated plus maze, altered responses to heat, sound and shock, and decreased levels of glutamate and glutamine, and increased levels of GABA and glycine. By contrast C57BL/6J mice had a more subtle phenotype with no further behavioural changes but significant elevations in serine, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Although the behavioural phenotype of AVD did not seem to model a specific disorder, the overall reduction in GAD65/67 levels associated with AVD deficiency may be relevant to a number of neuropsychiatric conditions. This is the first study to show an association between AVD deficiency and prominent changes in behaviour and brain neurochemistry in the mouse. © 2012.},

abstract={Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas it is well established that the environment can have profound influences on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3 personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder, thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive. © The Author 2012.},

abstract={Behavioural plasticity is a critical component of natural selection leading to evolution. However, a surge of studies in the last two decades has discovered a distinct limit to behavioural plasticity, commonly referred to as behaviour types and behavioural syndromes. We set out to understand the relationships across behavioural categories in wild-caught adult, female big brown bats and how they compare between social and solitary behaviours. Using bats sampled from four different maternity colonies, we ran a series of behavioural assays to create a behavioural profile for each individual. The behavioural profile encompassed exploratory, learning, competitive and aggressive categories. We found that Big brown bats exhibit a mean profile relatively unique to other well-documented species, where aggression was linked to increased competitive ability but not to boldness. Our results indicate that the solitary and socially directed behaviours of individuals are not necessarily related and that behaviours pertaining to social interactions are linked most closely to learning abilities. Furthermore, we found evidence that poor body condition may be a predictor of increased social interactions and that behaviours exhibited in the presence of conspecifics are unrelated to those exhibited in solitude. These findings indicate importance of social affiliations on individual behaviours in this species and their uniqueness relative to other well-studied taxa. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

Only relatively recently has the focus extended to the incubation phase and, even more recently, to the nest-building phase where there is now observational, comparative and experimental evidence that avian nest building is an energetically and temporally expensive activity. This review emphasises that nest construction is energetically expensive and we suggest that such costs should be incorporated into avian life-history research.},

abstract={A preclinical model that includes measures of alternative behavior and drug-seeking could improve our understanding of the processes involved in successful recovery; however current preclinical models of relapse do not measure alternative behavior. We assessed the persistence of food-maintained responding and the resumption of ethanol-maintained responding after ethanol-maintained responding was reduced by changing the response requirement for concurrently available food. Ethanol (10%, w/v) was always available following 5 responses (FR5). A 16. kHz tone indicating food delivery followed 150 responses (FR150) resulted in ethanol-predominate responding and substantial amounts of ethanol were earned (0.47. g/kg per 30-min session) and consumed. An 8. kHz tone indicating food delivery followed 5 responses (FR5) for 1, 2, 4, or 16 consecutive sessions reduced ethanol-maintained responding despite unchanged ethanol availability. Ethanol-maintained responding resumed upon subsequent presentation of the 16. kHz tone. However, more responses occurred on the food lever before 5 responses occurred on the ethanol lever as the number of preceding FR5 food sessions increased. These results suggest that alternative reinforcement may reduce control by discriminative stimuli that occasion ethanol-seeking and is consistent with the risk of relapse declining with longer periods of recovery because of the strengthening of alternative behavior. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The current investigation is a contribution to the animal welfare debate on acceptable stocking densities in broiler chickens. Two stocking densities on similar levels as currently legally regulated (35 kg/m2 und 40 kg/m2) and two cleary lower stocking densities (18 kg/m2 und 25 kg/m2) were investigated in groups of 18 to 42 Lohmann broiler chickens (B) in three batches with each time one replication of all stocking densities. Target weight of the broiler chickens was 2 kg at 39 or 40 days of age. Mortality, final live weights and activity levels were not significantly different between stocking densities. The proportion of time birds were sitting/lying increased in general with age from about 56% to 82%, probably due to their rapid growth. Nevertheless, at the lower stocking densities there was only in single cases. Moreover, significantly more footpads showed medium grade alterations under higher density conditions; high grade alterations were also different between 35 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2. Walking ability was only different between the lowest and the two higher densities. Altogether results reflect behavioural restriction at the higher stocking densities with increased risks for footpad alterations and lameness. In order to reach clear animal welfare improvements, e. g. in the framework of animal welfare labeling, a considerable lowering of the stocking density is consequently one important measure. However, this recommendation should be further validated under commercial conditions.},

Results Multi-group structural equation modelling results suggested that low self-esteem, overevaluation of weight and shape, and mood intolerance processes were transdiagnostic. However, some differences between diagnostic groups were observed. Dietary restraint was only positively associated with binge eating in BN, interpersonal difficulties were only associated with dietary restraint in eating disorder not otherwise specified and perfectionism was not associated with core eating disorder maintaining mechanisms in BN.

abstract={Cue-induced cravings may hinder behavior change efforts such as smoking cessation. Correlation of cue-induced cravings across multiple stimuli would provide evidence for a cue-reactive phenotype that may have implications for behavior change therapies. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between cue-induced cravings for cigarettes and cue-induced cravings for a highly preferred food (chocolate) in a sample of smokers not subjected to lengthy deprivation for either of these two appetitive outcomes. Adult smokers (N = 164) were assessed for chocolate cravings before and after exposure to chocolate cues and cigarette cravings before and after exposure to smoking cues. Consistent with previous reports, cigarette cravings increased significantly post-cue exposure and chocolate cravings increased significantly post-cue exposure (p's < .0001). Consistent with study hypotheses, the magnitude of the increase in chocolate cravings after cue-exposure was significantly related to the increase in post-cue cigarette cravings (r = 0.38; p < .0001), and was significantly related to scores on a retrospective, self-report, measure of cue-induced food cravings in daily life. These findings are consistent with the idea of a general "cue-reactive" phenotype that varies across individuals, a conceptualization of risk that may point the way toward improved interventions for a variety of hedonically mediated behaviors with negative health outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The prevalence of obesity has markedly increased over the past few decades. Exploration of how hunger and satiety signals influence the reward system can help us understand non-homeostatic feeding. Insulin may act in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a critical site for reward-seeking behavior, to suppress feeding. However, the neural mechanisms underlying insulin effects in the VTA remain unknown. We demonstrate that insulin, a circulating catabolic peptide that inhibits feeding, can induce long-term depression (LTD) of mouse excitatory synapses onto VTA dopamine neurons. This effect requires endocannabinoid- mediated presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release. Furthermore, after a sweetened high-fat meal, which elevates endogenous insulin, insulin-induced LTD is occluded. Finally, insulin in the VTA reduces food anticipatory behavior in mice and conditioned place preference for food in rats. Taken together, these results suggest that insulin in the VTA suppresses excitatory synaptic transmission and reduces anticipatory activity and preference for food-related cues. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: Early malnutrition is a highly prevalent condition in developing countries. Different rodent models of postnatal early malnutrition have been used to approach the subject experimentally, inducing early malnutrition by maternal malnutrition, temporal maternal separation, manipulation of litter size or the surgical nipple ligation to impair lactation. Studies on the behaviour of (previously) malnourished animals using animal models have produced sometimes contradictory results regarding the effects of early postnatal malnutrition and have been criticized for introducing potential confounding factors. The present paper is a first report on the behavioural effects of early malnutrition induced by an alternative approach: mice nursed by α-casein-deficient knockout dams showed a severe growth delay during early development and substantial catch-up growth after weaning when compared with animals nursed by wild-type females. Methods: Established behavioural tests were used to study the consequences of early postnatal malnutrition on mouse pups at weaning and after partial weight recovery. Results: Despite the impaired growth, the only behavioural difference between malnourished and normally growing animals was found in exploratory behaviour during acute malnutrition at the time of weaning. After partial catch-up in weight early protein malnourished animals showed no indication of lasting effects on general activity, emotionality and exploration, memory, and pain reactivity. Discussion: These results suggest that the role of early nutrition on behavioural development after recovery in animal models may have been overestimated. Further careful examination of this animal model in terms of maternal care and offspring behaviour will be necessary to confirm if mice nursed by α-casein-deficient dams offer an alternative to existing models while eliminating potential confounding factors.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the tactile/handling stimulation (H) and environmental enrichment (EE) in well-nourished (C- 16% of protein) and malnourished (M- 6% of protein) rats tested in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) at 36 and 37 days of age. The results showed higher exploration of the open arms in the EPM in M as compared with C animals, as well as lower index of risk assessment behaviors, and EE, but not H, reversed the alterations produced by malnutrition in the EPM. Biochemical analysis showed higher levels of corticosterone in M when compared with C rats. The nonstimulated animals presented higher levels of polyamines in the hippocampus when compared with the stimulated ones in both diet conditions. It is suggested that both the lower anxiety levels and the lower risk-assessment behaviors in the EPM, as well as the higher levels of corticosterone, can be due to alterations in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as the result of early protein malnutrition. © W.

abstract={Behavioral conditioning of immune responses is one of the most impressive examples for the bidirectional communication among the nervous and immune systems. We established a model of behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression employing a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm in the rat pairing a novel taste (saccharin) as a conditioned stimulus (CS) with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA) as an unconditioned stimulus (US). By re-presenting the CS during evocation, rats avoid drinking the saccharin. Concomitantly animals display an immunosuppression reflected by an ex vivo reduction in splenic T cell proliferation as well as diminished interleukin-2 and interferon-γ production and cytokine mRNA expression, mimicking the actual effect of the US (CsA). Due to the fact that the kinetics of this behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression are completely unknown, extinction of the conditioned response on the behavioral level (CTA) as well as in the immune response needs to be elucidated together with the neural processes mediating the extinction process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Signaling at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans controls many behaviors, including egg-laying and locomotor activity. Here, we show that C. elegans approaches a point source of nicotine in a time-, concentration- and age-dependent manner. Additionally, nicotine paired with butanone under starvation conditions prevented the reduced approach to butanone that is observed when butanone is paired with starvation alone and pairing with nicotine generates a preference for the tastes of either sodium or chloride over baseline. These results suggest nicotine acts as a rewarding substance in C. elegans. Furthermore, the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, the smoking cessation pharmacotherapy varenicline, mutation of the dop-1 and dop-2 dopamine receptors, and mutations of either acr-5 or acr-15, two nicotinic receptor subunit genes with sequence homology to the mammalian α7 subunit, all reduced the nicotine approach behavior. These two mutants also were defective at associating the presence of nicotine with butanone under starvation conditions and acr-5 mutation could obviate the effect of pairing nicotine with salts. Furthermore, the approach deficit in acr-15 mutants was rescued by selective re-expression in a subset of neurons, but not in muscle. Caenorhabditis elegans may therefore serve as a useful model organism for nicotine-motivated behaviors that could aid in the identification of novel nicotine motivational molecular pathways and consequently the development of novel cessation aids. © 2013 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Animal venoms are complex chemical mixtures that typically contain hundreds of proteins and non-proteinaceous compounds, resulting in a potent weapon for prey immobilization and predator deterrence. However, because venoms are protein-rich, they come with a high metabolic price tag. The metabolic cost of venom is sufficiently high to result in secondary loss of venom whenever its use becomes non-essential to survival of the animal. The high metabolic cost of venom leads to the prediction that venomous animals may have evolved strategies for minimizing venom expenditure. Indeed, various behaviors have been identified that appear consistent with frugality of venom use. This has led to formulation of the "venom optimization hypothesis" (Wigger et al. (2002) Toxicon 40, 749-752), also known as "venom metering", which postulates that venom is metabolically expensive and therefore used frugally through behavioral control. Here, we review the available data concerning economy of venom use by animals with either ancient or more recently evolved venom systems. We conclude that the convergent nature of the evidence in multiple taxa strongly suggests the existence of evolutionary pressures favoring frugal use of venom. However, there remains an unresolved dichotomy between this economy of venom use and the lavish biochemical complexity of venom, which includes a high degree of functional redundancy. We discuss the evidence for biochemical optimization of venom as a means of resolving this conundrum. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) can cause persistent neuropsychological and motor abnormalities in affected children, but the physiological consequences of PCE remain unclear. Conclusions drawn from clinical studies can sometimes be confounded by polysubstance abuse and nutritional deprivation. However, existing observations suggest that cocaine exposure in utero, as in adults, increases synaptic dopamine and promotes enduring dopamine-dependent plasticity at striatal synapses, altering behaviors and basal ganglia function. Methods We used a combination of behavioral measures, electrophysiology, optical imaging, and biochemical and electrochemical recordings to examine corticostriatal activity in adolescent mice exposed to cocaine in utero. Results We show that PCE caused abnormal dopamine-dependent behaviors, including heightened excitation following stress and blunted locomotor augmentation after repeated treatment with amphetamine. These abnormal behaviors were consistent with abnormal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron function, which promoted a reversible depression in corticostriatal activity. PCE hyperpolarized and reduced tonic GABA currents in both fast-spiking and persistent low-threshold spiking type GABA interneurons to increase tonic inhibition at GABAB receptors on presynaptic corticostriatal terminals. Although D2 receptors paradoxically increased glutamate release following PCE, normal corticostriatal modulation by dopamine was reestablished with a GABAA receptor antagonist. Interpretation The dynamic alterations at corticostriatal synapses that occur in response to PCE parallel the reported effects of repeated psychostimulants in mature animals, but differ in being specifically generated through GABAergic mechanisms. Our results indicate approaches that normalize GABA and D2 receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity may be useful for treating the behavioral effects of PCE and other developmental disorders that are generated through abnormal GABAergic signaling.

abstract={Obesity is associated with increased risk of a number of cancers in humans, but the mechanism(s) responsible for these associations have not been established. It is estimated that 68% of adults are overweight or obese and that obesity maybe causative in 4% to 7% of cancers in the United States. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the association between obesity and cancer including adipose-directed signaling (e.g., mTOR, AMPK), production of factors (e.g., insulin growth factor 1, fibroblast growth factor 1, and/or chronic inflammation associated with obesity. Huffman and colleagues used surgical methods to determine if visceral fat was causally related to intestinal tumorigenesis in the Apc1638/N+ mouse in a manner independent of confounding factors such as caloric restriction. They found that caloric restriction could extend survival in both male and female Apc1638/N+ mice but found that surgical removal of visceral fat was only effective in reducing macroadenomas in females. The results of this study do not identify the specific mechanism of association between visceral fat and intestinal carcinogenesis in female mice but do support the rationale for future cancer prevention trials that evaluate pharmacologic and behavioral strategies to reduce abdominal obesity in humans. © 2013 AACR.},

abstract={Obesity is now growing at an alarming rate reaching epidemic proportions worldwide thus increasing morbidity and mortality rates for chronic disease. But although we have ample information on the complications associated with obesity, precisely what causes obesity remains poorly understood. Some evidence attributes a major role to a low-grade chronic inflammatory state (neurogenic inflammation) induced in obesity by inflammatory mediators produced and secreted within the expanded activated adipocyte pool. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that secretes numerous adipose tissue-specific or enriched hormones, known as adipokines, cytokine-like molecules thought to play a pathogenic role in cardiovascular diseases. The imbalance between increased inflammatory stimuli and decreased anti-inflammatory mechanisms may depend on chronic stress. Hence the positive correlation found between stress, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. The chronic inflammatory state associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction is highly deleterious for vascular function. This review focuses on the proposed neuroimmunodulatory mechanisms linking chronic (psychological) stress, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the differences among three subtypes of feeding disorders (FD), defined through the criteria of the DC:0-3R: "Infantile Anorexia" (IA), "Feeding Disorder Associated with Insults to the Gastrointestinal Tract" (FDIGT), and "Sensory Food Aversions" (SFA), by exploring mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes. Method: The sample consisted of 146 Italian mother-child pairs, of which 51 children with IA, 47 children with FDIGT, and 48 mothers and their children with SFA. All dyads were videotaped during feeding; mothers completed questionnaires assessing their psychological profiles and eating attitudes, as well as their children's temperament and emotional/behavioral functioning. Results: Analyses revealed significant differences between the diagnostic groups of FD in relation to mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes. Discussion: Both interactional and individual variables may contribute differently to specific FD and outcomes during childhood. Definitions by FD subtypes, using operational diagnostic criteria, and the assessment of mother-child interactions are relevant to target interventions strategies to treat specific disorders.

abstract={Although stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders, not all individuals who suffer stressful life events develop psychopathology. Differential susceptibility to stress may be influenced by genetically-mediated differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and moderation of the stress response by the opioid peptide β-endorphin (β-E). The present study investigated genetic contributions to coping behavior by examining anxious behavior of transgenic mice with varying capacities to synthesize β-E (B6.129S2-Pomctm1Low/J; regulated by insertion of a premature stop codon into one or both copies of the proopiomelanocortin gene), both under normal conditions and following 3 minutes of forced swim. Ten minutes after this stress exposure or a control manipulation, acutely food-deprived female and male transgenic mice were subjected to a novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, during which their interaction with an almond slice located in the center of an open field box was measured. There was an interaction between genotype and stress for latency to approach the almond and whether or not the almond was approached, such that mice with low or absent β-E displayed a stronger aversion to novelty-feeding after stress exposure than did mice with normal levels. These data provide evidence for a moderating effect of β-E on the behavioral response to stress. Genotypic differences in anxious behavior emerged when mice were stressed prior to behavioral assessment, suggesting that β-E plays a role in coping behavior. These findings indicate that genetic variability in sensitivity of the β-E system to stress may contribute, at least in part, to heritable differences in stress reactivity as well as vulnerability to stress-related psychopathology. © 2013 Barfield, Moser, Hand and Grisel.},

abstract={Carbon dioxide (CO2) elicits an attractive host-seeking response from mosquitos [1-3] yet is innately aversive to Drosophila melanogaster [4, 5] despite being a plentiful byproduct of attractive fermenting food sources. Prior studies used walking flies exclusively, yet adults track distant food sources on the wing [6]. Here we show that a fly tethered within a magnetic field allowing free rotation about the yaw axis [7] actively seeks a narrow CO2 plume during flight. Genetic disruption of the canonical CO 2-sensing olfactory neurons does not alter in-flight attraction to CO2; however, antennal ablation and genetic disruption of the Ir64a acid sensor do. Surprisingly, mutation of the obligate olfactory coreceptor (Orco [8]) does not abolish CO2 aversion during walking [4] yet eliminates CO2 tracking in flight. The biogenic amine octopamine regulates critical physiological processes during flight [9-11], and blocking synaptic output from octopamine neurons inverts the valence assigned to CO 2 and elicits an aversive response in flight. Combined, our results suggest that a novel Orco-mediated olfactory pathway that gains sensitivity to CO2 in flight via changes in octopamine levels, along with Ir64a, quickly switches the valence of a key environmental stimulus in a behavioral-state-dependent manner. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={There is no consensus about the effects of protein restriction on neurogenesis and behavior. Here, for the first time, we evaluated the effects of protein restriction during gestation and lactation, on the two major neurogenic regions of the adult brain, the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ), simultaneously. We also assessed different types of behavior relevant to each region. After mating, pregnant Wistar rats were divided into a control group (CG) that received a normal diet (20% protein); and a protein-restriction group (PRG) that received a low-protein diet (8% protein). After birth, the same diets were provided to the mother and pups until weaning, when some rats were analyzed and others received a normal-protein diet until adulthood. Different sets of rats were used for cellular and behavioral studies in juvenile or adult age. Brains were processed for immunohistochemistry anti-BrdU, anti-Ki67, or anti-pHisH3. Juvenile and adult rats from distinct litters also underwent several behavioral tests. Our data show that early protein restriction results in a reduction of hippocampal progenitors and deficits in object recognition during adult life. Moreover, longer periods of immobility in the tail suspension and in the forced swimming tests revealed that PRG rats show a depressive behavior at 21 days of age (P21) and in adulthood. Furthermore, we suggest that despite the reduced number/proliferation of neural stem cells (B and/or E cells) in SVZ there is a compensatory mechanism in which the progenitors (types C and A cells) proliferate in a higher rate, without affecting olfactory ability in adulthood. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Recently, we have described a strong association of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA) with obesity and insulin resistance. In the current study, we have investigated the potential impact of BCAA on behavioral functions. We demonstrate that supplementation of either a high-sucrose or a high-fat diet with BCAA induces anxiety-like behavior in rats compared with control groups fed on unsupplemented diets. These behavioral changes are associated with a significant decrease in the concentration of tryptophan (Trp) in brain tissues and a consequent decrease in serotonin but no difference in indices of serotonin synaptic function. The anxiety-like behaviors and decreased levels of Trp in the brain of BCAA-fed rats were reversed by supplementation of Trp in the drinking water but not by administration of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, suggesting that the behavioral changes are independent of the serotonergic pathway of Trp metabolism. Instead, BCAA supplementation lowers the brain levels of another Trp-derived metabolite, kynurenic acid, and these levels are normalized by Trp supplementation. We conclude that supplementation of high-energy diets with BCAA causes neurobehavioral impairment. Since BCAA are elevated spontaneously in human obesity, our studies suggest a potential mechanism for explaining the strong association of obesity and mood disorders. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={In both animal and human behavioral repertoires, classical expected utility theory is considered a fundamental element of decision making under conditions of uncertainty. This theory has been widely applied to problems of animal behavior and evolutionary game theory, as well as to human economic behavior. The Allais paradox hinges on the expression of avoidance of bankruptcy by humans, or death by starvation in animals. This paradox reveals that human behavioral patterns are often inconsistent with predictions under the classical expected utility theory as formulated by von Neumann and Morgenstern. None of the many attempts to reformulate utility theory has been entirely successful in resolving this paradox with rigorous logic. We present a simple, but novel approach to the theory of decision making, in which utility is dependent on current wealth, and in which losses are more heavily weighted than gains. Our approach resolves the Allais paradox in a manner that is consistent with how humans formulate decisions under uncertainty. Our results indicate that animals, including humans, are in principle risk-averse. Our restructuring of dynamic utility theory presents a basic optimization scheme for sequential or dynamic decisions in both animals and humans. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={Most living organisms, including humans, age. Over time the ability to do physical and intellectual work deteriorates, and susceptibility to infectious, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases increases, which leads to general fitness decline and ultimately to death. Work in model organisms has demonstrated that genetic and environmental manipulations can prevent numerous age-associated diseases, improve health at advanced age, and increase life span. Calorie restriction (CR) (consumption of a diet with fewer calories but containing all the essential nutrients) is the most robust manipulation, genetic or environmental, to extend longevity and improve health parameters in laboratory animals. However, outside of the protected laboratory environment, the effects of CR are much less certain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of CR may lead to the development of novel therapies to combat diseases of aging and to improve the quality of life. Sirtuins, a family of NAD +-dependent enzymes, mediate a number of metabolic and behavioral responses to CR and are intriguing targets for pharmaceutical interventions. We review the molecular understanding of CR; the role of sirtuins in CR; and the effects of sirtuins on physiology, mood, and behavior. Copyright © 2013 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Plants respond to herbivore damage with the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This indirect defense can cause ecological costs when herbivores themselves use VOCs as cues to localize suitable host plants. Can VOCs reliably indicate food plant quality to herbivores? Methodology: We determined the choice behavior of herbivorous beetles (Chrysomelidae: Gynandrobrotica guerreroensis and Cerotoma ruficornis) when facing lima bean plants (Fabaceae: Phaseolus lunatus) with different cyanogenic potential, which is an important constitutive direct defense. Expression of inducible indirect defenses was experimentally manipulated by jasmonic acid treatment at different concentrations. The long-distance responses of male and female beetles to the resulting induced plant volatiles were investigated in olfactometer and free-flight experiments and compared to the short-distance decisions of the same beetles in feeding trials. Conclusion: Female beetles of both species were repelled by VOCs released from all induced plants independent of the level of induction. In contrast, male beetles were repelled by strongly induced plants, showed no significant differences in choice behavior towards moderately induced plants, but responded positively to VOCs released from little induced plants. Thus, beetle sex and plant VOCs had a significant effect on host searching behavior. By contrast, feeding behavior of both sexes was strongly determined by the cyanogenic potential of leaves, although females again responded more sensitively than males. Apparently, VOCs mainly provide information to these beetles that are not directly related to food quality. Being induced by herbivory and involved in indirect plant defense, such VOCs might indicate the presence of competitors and predators to herbivores. We conclude that plant quality as a food source and finding a potentially enemy-free space is more important for female than for male insect herbivores, whereas the presence of a slightly damaged plant can help males to localize putative mating partners. © 2013 Ballhorn et al.},

abstract={Many species respond to risks and benefits of dispersal that vary over the short term through condition-dependent dispersal. We used wind tunnels to investigate how abiotic factors, spiderling age, and indicators of environmental quality affect aerial dispersal behaviour of spiderlings in Dolomedes triton (Walckenaer) (Araneae: Pisauridae), a denizen of temporary habitats. More than half of all spiderlings exhibited preballooning, ballooning, or spanning behaviours. Warm temperatures (>22.5 °C) and low wind speeds (<2.0 m/second) increased aerial dispersal. Aerial dispersal behaviour increased significantly until 5 days after hatch, after which it decreased, coinciding with the onset of active hunting by spiderlings. In contrast, cues about ambient food availability (egg sac number and food limitation of the mother) and potential resource competition or risk of cannibalism (conspecific density) did not affect aerial dispersal propensity. Offspring from different females ballooned in different proportions, except at the peak of dispersal, but a female's reproductive output and propensity of her offspring to balloon were uncorrelated. Thus, it appears that spiderlings of D. triton adopt a fixed strategy of high dispersal rate under optimal abiotic conditions, rather than reducing dispersal in response to cues about local food availability or conspecific density.

abstract={The correlation of seemingly unrelated behaviours into behavioural syndromes has been established in a wide range of species and taxa. However, most studies report on short-term behavioural correlations without insight into individual consistency or temporal stability of the behavioural syndrome. Here, we examine the individual repeatability of single behaviours, and the presence and temporal stability of a context-general behavioural syndrome in a solitary piscivorous predator, the pike (Esox lucius). Behavioural measurements on the same individuals were quantified independently through time and across three contexts: activity in the presence of a competitor, exploration of a novel environment and boldness under predation risk. There was no indication of a temporally stable behavioural syndrome, consisting of boldness, activity and exploration, nor were individuals consistent in the separate behaviours, contradicting the general assertion of its taxonomic prevalence. Furthermore, the study did not provide support for size or growth-dependent behaviour in this size-dimorphic species in conditions of limited food availability. The study highlights the importance of independent multiple observations of individual behaviour across time or contexts when measuring behavioural repeatability and covariation. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Movement behaviour plays an important role in many ecological interactions. As animals move through the environment, they generate movement patterns, which are a combined result of landscape characteristics and species-specific behaviour. Measuring these ranging patterns is being facilitated by technological advances in collection methods, such as GPS collars, that are capturing movement on finer spatial and temporal scales. We propose the use of a novel spatiotemporal analytical framework (ST-BBD), based on the beta-binomial distribution (BBD) model, to measure small-scale aggregation in animal movement data sets, including two simulated and three collected primate data sets. We use this approach to distinguish different habitat uses of three primate species (red colobus, Procolobus rufomitratus, black howler, Alouatta pigra, and spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi) and quantify their specific use of the landscape in space and in time, using a parameter of the BBD that measures the variation in sites visited on a landscape. We found that estimates of aggregation in habitat use were higher in the frugivorous spider monkey, compared to the more folivorous howler monkey, and that in the red colobus, aggregation in site visits was dependent on group size and food availability. Applications of this framework to animal movement data could be useful in understanding ecological systems where habitat use is an important factor, such as the relationships between hosts and parasites, or parent plants and seed dispersers. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={A primary benefit of grouping is diluting the individual risk of attack by predators. However, the fact that groups are formed not always by solitary adults but also by subgroups (e.g., families) has been overlooked. The subgroup-specific benefit of predator dilution depends on its relative contribution to total group size. Therefore, the willingness of a subgroup to merge with others should increase the less it contributes to total group size, but the conflicting preferences of partners may result in the preferential merger of similar- sized subgroups. Here, we evaluate how the proportional contribution of subgroups to diluting risk affects group formation. We generate predictions using a bidding game over parental care and test them using data on common eiders (Somateria mollissima), in which females with variable-sized broods may form brood-rearing coalitions. The predictions (1) that size-matched subgroups should have a higher propensity to merge, (2) that predation should increase group formation propensity, and (3) that increased bargaining power, as proxied by female body condition, should increase the time needed to establish partnerships were all supported. Partners do negotiate over their relative contributions to predator dilution, accepting or rejecting partnerships on the basis of this criterion. Our results show that consideration of the size of subgroups before merger is critical in understanding the process of group formation under the threat of predation. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Many ecologists believe that there is a lack of foraging theory that works in community contexts, for populations of unique individuals each making trade-offs between food and risk that are subject to feedbacks from behavior of others. Such theory is necessary to reproduce the trait-mediated trophic interactions now recognized as widespread and strong. Game theory can address feedbacks but does not provide foraging theory for unique individuals in variable environments. 'State- and prediction-based theory' (SPT) is a new approach that combines existing trade-off methods with routine updating: individuals regularly predict future food availability and risk from current conditions to optimize a fitness measure. SPT can reproduce a variety of realistic foraging behaviors and trait-mediated trophic interactions with feedbacks, even when the environment is unpredictable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Adults that cannibalize juvenile conspecifics gain substantial energy and nutrients that are potentially limited in their normal diet, but they may also face the risk of filial cannibalism: the consumption of an individual's own offspring. However, the potential costs and benefits of cannibalism change with the reproductive status of an individual during its lifetime. Once adults become reproductively active, they suddenly face the potential loss of inclusive fitness associated with filial cannibalism, but they also have higher energy demands that could easily be met with cannibalism. Thus, selection should favour any behaviour that reduces the risk of filial cannibalism while maximizing the nutritional and other benefits of cannibalism. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the relative importance of kin discrimination, reproductive status and sex differences in influencing cannibalistic behaviour (including filial cannibalism) of adults using confused flour beetles, Tribolium confusum, as a model system. Using a series of complementary experiments, we show that the cannibalistic behaviour of T. confusum is driven by a combination of two factors that both reduce the risk of filial cannibalism. First, reproductive females preferred to cannibalize unrelated eggs over related eggs, indicating clear kin discrimination. In addition, females also showed a dramatic reduction in the general propensity for cannibalism after becoming reproductively active. Interestingly, the onset of reproduction also reduced cannibalism rates in males, indicating that this change in cannibalistic behaviour is consistent across sexes. Mating status had a greater influence on cannibalism rates than did sex. Together, kin discrimination and mating-status-dependent shifts in cannibalism rates reduced the risk of filial cannibalism by up to six-fold. In general, our findings suggest that evolution can alter the cannibalistic behaviour of individuals in multiple ways to reduce the risk of filial cannibalism while still maximizing the benefits of cannibalism. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, feeds on the blood of mammal and bird hosts, and is a pest of global importance. Semiochemicals are chemicals involved in animal communication that may affect behaviour and/or physiology. Attractive semiochemicals that play a role in mediating bed bug behaviour could be exploited for the development of a highly effective novel monitoring device. Tracking software was used to record the response of bed bugs to volatiles from paper previously exposed to conspecific bugs in a still-air olfactometer illuminated by infrared lights, through a variety of activity variables. The effect of time of day as an extrinsic factor, and sex, stage, mating status and nutritional status as physiological factors on the response of bed bugs to the volatiles was examined. Bed bugs of both sexes and all stages responded to the volatiles from bed bug-exposed papers, showing significant attraction and orientation towards the volatile source whether they were starved or engorged. Confirmation that the physiological factors examined do not affect the response of bed bugs to the volatiles from bed bugexposed papers provides evidence that these bed bug-derived volatiles contain aggregation cues, as semiochemicals that promote aggregation should by definition be detected by both sexes and all life stages. A device baited with such semiochemicals could play a major role in limiting the impact of the current bed bug resurgence by enabling timely detection of infestations, along with quantitative evaluation of control and effective surveillance of the geographical distribution of the pest species. © 2013.

abstract={Fission-fusion systems provide models for studying grouping decisions and social complexity in a range of taxa, as individuals act to manage risks and enhance reproductive success. African savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana africana, live in a fluid society where individual relationships persist over decades and affect reproductive success. Social structures have yet to be fully characterized for forest elephants, Loxodonta africana cyclotis. Aggregations at natural forest clearings, which are frequent in this subspecies, may offer social benefits in addition to nutritional resources. We examined the social functions of aggregations in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of Congo. We tested whether clearings function as 'social arenas' by examining how social opportunities affected the timing and duration of visits, and how short-term grouping decisions were affected by age, sex, group size and number of elephants present. Aggregations reflected a fission-fusion society similar to that observed in savannah elephants. Grouping patterns were largely unaffected by the number of elephants present, from which we infer that elephants were not acting to minimize competition. Social opportunities affected visit patterns such that visits were longer when others were present. Social opportunities were maximized by joining large groups, often including older elephants, or, for males, parties with females. Large and dynamically changing social groups in clearings offer potential for information exchange and the maintenance of social relationships. Demonstrating that fission-fusion operates in forest elephant society allows future research to focus on cost-benefit modelling, to understand the fitness consequences of these groupings. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Egg cannibalism is a widely observed behaviour in nature that provides nutritional benefits without the costs of subduing prey. However, when egg cannibalism involves sibling eggs, the benefits obtained must balance inclusive fitness losses. Neonates of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, readily consume other eggs within their natal clutch. To explore the fitness consequences of this behaviour, neonates were fed no, one, or two eggs upon hatching, along with their normal diet of potato foliage. Daily mass, the time to each moult, adult volume and mass, and fecundity were measured for each individual, along with mortality rates. Cannibals gained mass more quickly and reached each developmental stage 1 day earlier than noncannibals. No benefits at the adult stage (other than earlier emergence) were observed, and there were no sex differences in the benefits of cannibalism. Mortality was not reduced by cannibalism under laboratory conditions. A simulation demonstrated that when the mortality risk is high, decreased development time due to cannibalism can reduce this risk sufficiently to balance the inclusive fitness loss of eating a single half-sibling. Additional benefits of cannibalism, such as reduced competition, need to be investigated to fully explain cannibalism of multiple sibling eggs. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Multiple studies have reported prenatal stress as a potential risk factor for the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In rodents, a significant reduction in sociability is seen in prenatally stressed offspring of genetically stress-susceptible dams. Certain dietary factors that contribute to stress reactivity may, therefore, exacerbate prenatal stress-mediated behavioral changes in adult offspring. Adults with a diet rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) display increased stress reactivity. In the current study, the effects of prenatal diet and prenatal stress on social behavior in adult offspring mice were examined. Pregnant C57BL/6. J dams received either chronic variable stress or no stress, and were also placed on a control diet or a diet rich in omega-6 PUFAs, in a 2. ×. 2 design. We subsequently tested the adult offspring for sociability, anxiety, and locomotor behaviors using a 3-chambered social approach task, an elevated-plus maze, an open field task and a rotarod task. Results indicated that a maternal diet rich in omega-6 PUFAs during gestation and lactation produce changes in sociability consistent with those observed in ASD. Additionally, offspring exposed to a diet rich in omega-6 PUFAs during gestation and lactation had increased levels of anxiety in the elevated-plus maze. Prenatal stress had no effect on offspring behavior. These findings provide evidence for a possible environmental risk factor that contributes to the production of autistic-like behavior in mice. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Leptin affects eating behavior partly by altering the response of the brain to food-related stimuli. The effects of leptin on brain structure have been observed in the cerebellum, where leptin receptors are most densely expressed, but the function of leptin in the cerebellum remains unclear. We performed a nonrandomized, prospective interventional study of three adults with genetically mediated leptin deficiency. FMRI was recorded three times each year during years 5 and 6 of leptin replacement treatment. Session 1 of each year occurred after 10 months of continuous daily replacement, session 2 after 33-37 days without leptin, and session 3 at 14-23 days after daily replacement was restored. Statistical parametric mapping software (SPM5) was employed to contrast the fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent response to images of high-calorie foods versus images of brick walls. Covariate analyses quantified the effects of the duration of leptin replacement and concomitant changes in body mass on the cerebral responses. Longer duration of replacement was associated with more activation by food images in a ventral portion of the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, while simultaneous decreases in body mass were associated with decreased activation in a more dorsal portion of the same lobe. These findings indicate that leptin replacement reversibly alters neural function within the posterior cerebellum and modulates plasticity-dependent brain physiology in response to food cues. The results suggest an underexplored role for the posterior cerebellum in the regulation of leptin-mediated processes related to food intake. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Impulsivity is regarded as a key feature in borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, discrepancies in previous research indicate that the role of impulsivity in BPD is not yet fully understood. For example, state-dependent impulsivity in individuals with BPD may be related to co-occurring psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to emotional states. We assessed self-reports of trait and state impulsivity and response inhibition before and after an experimental stress induction in 15 patients with BPD without ADHD, 15 patients with BPD and ADHD, 15 patients with ADHD, and 15 healthy participants. The patients in both BPD subgroups reported a stress-dependent increase of state impulsivity, which was not observed in the other groups. Response inhibition was impaired in the patients with BPD and ADHD but not in those without ADHD compared with the healthy participants. We suggest that stress levels and co-occurring ADHD should receive attention in future studies on impulsivity in BPD. Copyright © 2013 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.},

abstract={Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in relentless restrictive eating and often become severely emaciated. Because there are no proven treatments, AN has high rates of relapse, chronicity, and death. Those with AN tend to have childhood temperament and personality traits, such as anxiety, obsessions, and perfectionism, which may reflect neurobiological risk factors for developing AN. Restricted eating may be a means of reducing negative mood caused by skewed interactions between serotonin aversive or inhibitory and dopamine reward systems. Brain imaging studies suggest that altered eating is a consequence of dysregulated reward and/or awareness of homeostatic needs, perhaps related to enhanced executive ability to inhibit incentive motivational drives. An understanding of the neurobiology of this disorder is likely to be important for developing more effective treatments. © 2013.},

abstract={Background: There is growing awareness of an association between cardiovascular disease and fractures, and a temporal increase in fracture risk after myocardial infarction has been identified. To further explore the nature of this relationship, we systematically examined the association of hip fracture with all disease categories and assessed related secular trends. Methods: By using resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a population-based incident case-control study was conducted. Disease history was compared among all Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents aged 50 years or more with a first radiographically confirmed hip fracture in 1985-2006 and community control subjects individually matched (1:1) to cases on age, sex, and index year (n = 3808; mean age, 82 years; standard deviation, 9 years; 76% were women). Results: All cardiovascular and numerous non-cardiovascular disease categories (eg, infectious diseases, nutritional and metabolic diseases, mental disorders, diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, and diseases of the respiratory system) were associated with fracture risk. However, increasing temporal trends were detected almost exclusively in cardiovascular disease categories. The largest increases in association were observed for ischemic heart disease, other forms of heart disease (including heart failure), hypertension, and diabetes, and were more pronounced among elderly women than other demographic subgroups. Conclusions: Although the association with hip fracture was not specific to cardiovascular disease, temporal increases were mainly detected in cardiometabolic diseases, all of which have been linked previously to frailty. This mechanism and others warrant further investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={While conventional wisdom holds that excessive body weight is the product of some combination of a high-calorie diet and a sedentary lifestyle, public health measures aimed at these factors have been met with only limited success. This chapter considers the possibility that obesity might be better understood in terms of the biologist's notion that humans and other animals evolved the ability to store body fat as an optimal response to the presence of starvation risk. Evidence from a broad array of disciplines is consistent with this view, including the neuroendocrinology of energy homeostasis, parallels between human and animal fattening behaviour, the effect of stress on dietary intake, population-level studies of the impact of economic insecurity on body weight and international variation in obesity rates. © The British Academy 2012.

abstract={Penguin foraging and breeding success depend on broad-scale environmental and local-scale hydrographic features of their habitat. We investigated the effect of local tidal currents on a population of Adélie penguins on Humble Is., Antarctica. We used satellite-tagged penguins, an autonomous underwater vehicle, and historical tidal records to model of penguin foraging locations over ten seasons. The bearing of tidal currents did not oscillate daily, but rather between diurnal and semidiurnal tidal regimes. Adélie penguins foraging locations changed in response to tidal regime switching, and not to daily tidal patterns. The hydrography and foraging patterns of Adélie penguins during these switching tidal regimes suggest that they are responding to changing prey availability, as they are concentrated and dispersed in nearby Palmer Deep by variable tidal forcing on weekly timescales, providing a link between local currents and the ecology of this predator. © 2013 Oliver et al.},

abstract={Condition-specific competition is widespread in nature. Species inhabiting heterogeneous environments tend to differ in competitive abilities depending on environmental stressors. Interactions between these factors can allow coexistence of competing species, which may be particularly important between invasive and native species. Here, we examine the effects of temperature on competitive interactions between invasive mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and an endemic Iberian toothcarp, Aphanius iberus. We compare the tendency to approach heterospecifics and food capture rates between these two species, and examine differences between sexes and species in aggressive interactions, at three different temperatures (19, 24 and 29°C) in three laboratory experiments. Mosquitofish exhibit much more aggression than toothcarp. We show that mosquitofish have the capacity to competitively displace toothcarp through interference competition and this outcome is more likely at higher temperatures. We also show a reversal in the competitive hierarchy through reduced food capture rate by mosquitofish at lower temperatures and suggest that these two types of competition may act synergistically to deprive toothcarp of food at higher temperatures. Males of both species carry out more overtly aggressive acts than females, which is probably related to the marked sexual dimorphism and associated mating systems of these two species. Mosquitofish may thus impact heavily on toothcarp, and competition from mosquitofish, especially in warmer summer months, may lead to changes in abundance of the native species and displacement to non-preferred habitats. Globally increasing temperatures mean that highly invasive, warm-water mosquitofish may be able to colonize environments from which they are currently excluded through reduced physiological tolerance to low temperatures. Research into the effects of temperature on interactions between native and invasive species is thus of fundamental importance. © 2013 Carmona-Catot et al.},

abstract={Feeding stations are commonly used to sustain conservation programs of scavengers but their impact on behaviour is still debated. They increase the temporal and spatial predictability of food resources while scavengers have supposedly evolved to search for unpredictable resources. In the Grands Causses (France), a reintroduced population of Griffon vultures Gyps fulvus can find carcasses at three types of sites: 1. "light feeding stations", where farmers can drop carcasses at their farm (spatially predictable), 2. "heavy feeding stations", where carcasses from nearby farms are concentrated (spatially and temporally predictable) and 3. open grasslands, where resources are randomly distributed (unpredictable). The impact of feeding stations on vulture's foraging behaviour was investigated using 28 GPS-tracked vultures. The average home range size was maximal in spring (1272±752 km2) and minimal in winter (473±237 km2) and was highly variable among individuals. Analyses of home range characteristics and feeding habitat selection via compositional analysis showed that feeding stations were always preferred compared to the rest of the habitat where vultures can find unpredictable resources. Feeding stations were particularly used when resources were scarce (summer) or when flight conditions were poor (winter), limiting long-ranging movements. However, when flight conditions were optimal, home ranges also encompassed large areas of grassland where vultures could find unpredictable resources, suggesting that vultures did not lose their natural ability to forage on unpredictable resources, even when feeding stations were available. However during seasons when food abundance and flight conditions were not limited, vultures seemed to favour light over heavy feeding stations, probably because of the reduced intraspecific competition and a pattern closer to the natural dispersion of resources in the landscape. Light feeding stations are interesting tools for managing food resources, but don't prevent vultures to feed at other places with possibly high risk of intoxication (poison). © 2013 Monsarrat et al.},

abstract={A definitive consequence of the aging process is the progressive deterioration of higher cognitive functions. Defects in DNA repair mechanisms mostly result in accelerated aging and reduced brain function. DNA polymerase μ is a novel accessory partner for the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair pathway for double-strand breaks, and its deficiency causes reduced DNA repair. Using associative learning and long-term potentiation experiments, we demonstrate that Polμ-/- mice, however, maintain the ability to learn at ages when wild-type mice do not. Expression and biochemical analyses suggest that brain aging is delayed in Polμ-/- mice, being associated with a reduced error-prone DNA oxidative repair activity and a more efficient mitochondrial function. This is the first example in which the genetic ablation of a DNA-repair function results in a substantially better maintenance of learning abilities, together with fewer signs of brain aging, in old mice. © 2013 Lucas et al.},

abstract={Food restriction is a defining characteristic of anorexia nervosa and a risk factor for binge pathology. Basic research related to drug addiction indicates that food restriction increases drug reward magnitude, persistence of preference for a drug-paired environment, and relapse to drug seeking. These phenomena suggest that drugs of abuse subvert the adaptive mechanisms that normally facilitate foraging, learning, and ingestion when food is scarce. Similarly, if supranormally rewarding, energy-dense food is abundant but the physiological effects of underfeeding prevail due to restricted intake, the risk of developing maladaptive addiction-like eating behavior may increase. In this chapter, methods are described for assessing neurotransmitter receptor mechanisms and intracellular signaling pathways in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that contribute to enhanced reward sensitivity in food-restricted rats. These methods combine intracerebral drug microinjection with the curve-shift rate-frequency protocol of intracranial self-stimulation testing. The addition of continuous intraventricular infusion of metabolic hormone or feeding-related neuropeptide receptor ligands is described as a means of assessing peripheral responses that may be antecedents to central nervous system changes of interest. When these studies are guided by biochemical findings in the NAc of food-restricted rats, the approach enables identification of neuroadaptations that increase reward sensitivity and suggests others that may increase synaptic plasticity and ingrain behavior. The goal is to generate a set of defined candidate mechanisms that can be evaluated for their involvement in the development and maintenance of disordered eating. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Behavioural strategies to reduce predation risk can incur costs, which are often referred to as risk effects. A common strategy to avoid predation is spatio-temporal avoidance of predators, in which prey typically trade optimal resources for safety. Analogous with predator-prey theory, risk effects should also arise in species with sexually selected infanticide (SSI), in which females with dependent offspring avoid infanticidal males. SSI can be common in brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations and explains spatio-temporal segregation among reproductive classes. Here, we show that in a population with SSI, females with cubs-of-the-year had lower quality diets than conspecifics during the SSI high-risk period, the mating season. After the mating season, their diets were of similar quality to diets of their conspecifics. Our results suggest a nutritive risk effect of SSI, in which females with cubs-of-the-year alter their resource selection and trade optimal resources for offspring safety. Such risk effects can add to female costs of reproduction and may be widespread among species with SSI.},

abstract={Many birds use regulated drops in night-time body temperature (Tb) to conserve energy critical to winter survival. However, a significant degree of hypothermia may limit a bird's ability to respond to predatory attack. Despite this likely energy predation trade-off, the behavioural costs of avian hypothermia have yet to be examined. We thus monitored the nocturnal hypothermia of mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) in a laboratory setting in response to food deprivation. Nocturnal flight tests were used to quantify the flight ability of hypothermic doves. Many hypothermic doves (39% of tests) could not fly while carrying a small weight, but could do so after quickly warming up to typical daytime Tb. Doves that were unable to fly during their first test were more hypothermic than those that could fly, with average Tb reductions of 5.3°C and 3.3°C, respectively, but there was no overall indication of a threshold Tb reduction beyond which doves were consistently incapable of flight. These results suggest that energy-saving hypothermia interferes with avian antipredator behaviour via a reduction in flight ability, likely leading to a trade-off between energy-saving hypothermia and the risk of predation. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The aim of the study was to test for diel patterns in the diet and habitat use in a feral, pond-dwelling, non-native fathead minnow Pimephales promelas population in England. Fish were collected in June 2009 using traps set in four habitat types (open waters, rushes-Juncuseffusus, weeds-Potamogeton natans and mixed vegetation), then sexed and measured for total length and eviscerated weight in the laboratory. Data were analysed at 6-h intervals, with Fulton's condition index and three dietary parameters (frequency of occurrence, number and weight) calculated. Minor diurnal differences in habitat use were observed in males, females and immatures, and these may be due to predator avoidance. Body condition varied greatly in rushes during daytime, probably due to shifts in habitat suitability (e. g. food, refuge). Detritus dominates the diet of native fathead minnow; however, planktonic crustaceans were the most important food resource for this population, with a clear ontogenetic shift, irrespective of habitat, towards greater proportion of ingested detritus in larger individuals. Overall, the results demonstrate that feral fathead minnows display substantial trophic plasticity and a wide range of habitat use, which is normally associated with invasive species. However, established fathead minnow populations in Europe are rare despite its wide-spread ornamental and scientific use. © 2012 Crown Copyright.},

abstract={Many species in social groups make use of readily available, socially provided information for behaviours including predator avoidance, mate choice and foraging. Not only are actions imitated, but they may also be reapplied in variable future situations, suggesting an explicit knowledge of the purpose of the behaviours. Social learning thus enables animals to learn about their complex environments rapidly and efficiently, aiding survival. However, little is known of the processes underlying information transmission and the complexity of information that can be exchanged. We used shoals of guppies to investigate how animals decide which individual to copy, and the extent of information that can be transferred. Naïve guppies followed the first fish to move. However, although the speed and accuracy of foraging increased significantly during training, the first fish to move was not always the trained (knowledgeable) guppy. No significant difference was found between the number of guppies entering areas of varying food quality, supporting the hypothesis that these fish learn foraging locations by following and suggesting that leaders forage without considering the reduced personal reward arising from sharing a low-quality patch with followers. Animals that learn by copying thus appear limited in the amount of information they can receive, highlighting a selection pressure for more extensive means of transmitting information in complex environments. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Many migrating birds divide their journeys into nocturnal flights interspersed by stopovers where they build up energy reserves (fuel) for subsequent flights. Given the difficulty in monitoring fuel loads of individual migrants over long distances, theoretical models are often used to interpret observed relations between departure fuel loads (DFLs) and fuel deposition rates (FDRs) in the context of time-minimised migration. Models applicable to nocturnal migration have hitherto considered only the departure decision, i.e. ignored interim stopover possibilities before fuel loads are depleted. This results in ‘risk-prone’ migratory schedules in terms of choice of stopover. In this study we assess ‘risk-averse’ behaviour, whereby nocturnal migrants minimise migration time by adjusting not only DFLs to experienced and expected FDRs, but also stopping fuel loads (SFLs), below which they stop to refuel at high-quality sites. We developed analytical formulae to solve for maximal risk-prone and risk-averse migration speeds in modelled environments comprised of two stopover qualities (high- and low-quality), and a constant probability of encountering a high-quality site (encounter probability). Risk-aversion was beneficial to migration speeds in over 99% of the modelled environments, with median ratios of risk-averse to risk-prone migration speeds ranging from 1.5 to 2.8. Among modelled environments, this benefit increased with increasing FDRs at high-quality sites, and was highest with low probabilities of encountering high-quality sites. Time-minimising risk-averse DFLs at low-quality sites were minimal in nearly all modelled environments, and whenever encounter probabilities were low, risk-averse SFLs typically indicated that migrants should stop immediately on encountering high-quality sites. Modelled fuel loads in environments with high and low encounter probabilities resembled observed fuel loads of migratory populations with ubiquitous and scarce food availability, respectively. This study demonstrates the benefits of risk-averse exploitation of variable resources, presents a new approach to model time-minimised migration in heterogeneous environments and emphasises the importance of premium stopover sites to nocturnally migrating birds. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A stronger focus on natural mortality may be required to better understand contemporary changes in fish life histories and behaviour and their responses to anthropogenic drivers. Firstly, natural mortality is the selection under which fish evolved in the first place, so a theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in some fished stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We therefore analyse a model for evolution of fish life histories and behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into five different components, each specified as the outcome of individual traits and ecological trade-offs: a fixed baseline mortality; size-dependent predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a fixed mortality when sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment. The analysis is repeated with and without fishing. Each component of natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies. Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable depending on the type of mortality changed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper investigates notable examples of sustainable lifestyles in relation to food systems. It explores the surprisingly neglected case of widely practised and environmentally sustainable food self-provisioning in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe. Our argument is rooted in qualitative and quantitative data gathered over a seven-year period (2005-2011). The research considers the extent of and motivations for these practices in Poland and Czechia. The very high rates compared to Western Europe and North America have generally been explained in terms of an 'urban peasantry' meeting essential needs. After reviewing and rejecting those accounts we present evidence for these as socially and environmentally beneficial practices, and explore how the motivations derive from a range of feelings about food, quality, capability and family and/or friendship. Rather than relate these practices to temporal signals of quality and sustainability in food ('slow' and 'fast'), or presenting them as 'alternative food networks' we suggest that they represent 'quiet sustainability'. This novel concept summarises widespread practices that result in beneficial environmental or social outcomes and that do not relate directly or indirectly to market transactions, but are not represented by their practitioners as relating directly to environmental or sustainability goals. These practices represent exuberant, appealing and socially inclusive, but also unforced, forms of sustainability. This case further demonstrates the severe limitations of decision makers' focus on economics and behaviour change, and their neglect of other dimensions of social life and change in developing environmental policies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={It is generally assumed that the choice of oviposition sites in arthropods is affected by the presence of food for the offspring on the one hand and by predation risk on the other hand. But where should females oviposit when the food itself poses a predation risk for their offspring? Here, we address this question by studying the oviposition behaviour of the predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii in reaction to the presence of its counterattacking prey, the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis. We offered the mites a choice between two potential oviposition sites, one with and one without food. We used two types of food: thrips larvae, which are predators of eggs of predatory mite but are consumed by older predator stages, and pollen, a food source that poses no risk to the predators. With pollen as food, the predators preferred ovipositing on the site with food. This might facilitate the foraging for food by the immature offspring that will emerge from the eggs. With thrips as food, female predators preferred ovipositing on the site without thrips. Predators that oviposited more on the site with thrips larvae killed more thrips larvae than females that oviposited on the site without food, but this did not result in higher oviposition. This suggests that the females killed thrips to protect their offspring. Our results show that predators display complex anti-predator behaviour in response to the presence of counter-attacking prey. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={Many arthropod species have adopted vertebrate blood as their main food source. Blood is rich in nutrients and, except for the presence of parasites, sterile. However, this food source is not freely available, nor is obtaining it devoid of risk. It circulates inside vessels hidden underneath the skin of mobile hosts that are able to defend themselves and even predate the insects that try to feed on them. Thus, the haematophagous lifestyle is associated with major morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations that have accumulated throughout the evolutionary history of the various lineages of blood-sucking arthropods. These adaptations have significant consequences for the evolution of parasites as well as for the epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. In this review article, we analyse various aspects of the behaviour of triatomine bugs to illustrate how each behavioural trait represents a particular adaptation to their close association with their hosts, which may easily turn into predators. Our aim is to offer to the reader an up-to-date integrative perspective on the behaviour of Chagas disease vectors and to propose new research avenues to encourage both young and experienced colleagues to explore this aspect of triatomine biology.},

abstract={Reasons for performing study: Horse misbehaviour is an important cause of poor performance in Pony Club horses, is associated with horse-related rider injuries and has been implicated as a nonspecific presenting sign for musculoskeletal pain. Despite this, little is known about the incidence of and risk factors for misbehaviour in Pony Club horses. Objective: This study aimed to describe the incidence and types of misbehaviour in a cohort of Pony Club horses and to identify risk factors for misbehaviour during riding. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted with 84 Pony Club horses from 41 families belonging to 7 Pony Clubs in one inland region of Australia. Owners recorded misbehaviour events and kept daily records of horse housing, exercise, nutrition, healthcare and disease status. Horses were subjected to a monthly veterinary examination. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the incidence of misbehaviour, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess putative risk factors. Results: Misbehaviour during riding occurred on 3% of days when horses were ridden. On 52% of days with misbehaviour, the misbehaviour was classified as dangerous. Risk of misbehaviour was independently increased on exercise days when the horse was competing, and in months when the horse was fat or obese, fed supplementary feed daily, grazed on paddocks with >50% of ground cover as green grass, exercised on 5 days per month or less, and ridden for a total of 12h or more in the month. No significant relationship was detected between misbehaviour and back pain. Conclusions: In populations such as the study population the risk of misbehaviour is higher in fatter horses, in horses with access to pastures with greater green grass cover, in those fed daily supplements, in horses receiving exercise less frequently, and during competition. Potential relevance: These results highlight the importance of considering horse body condition, nutrition and exercise in any investigation of horse misbehaviour. In addition, recommendations based on these results could be used by veterinarians assisting horse owners to prevent misbehaviour. From the perspective of recreational horse owners, behaviour is a key determinant of horse performance. © 2012 EVJ Ltd.},

abstract={In chicken, oils in the maternal diet confer a specific scent to the yolk. Embryos are known to perceive and memorize chemosensory signals of the surrounding environment; however, the potential impact of the maternal diet has not previously been investigated. In the present study, we hypothesized that chicken embryos memorize the chemical signals of the maternal diet and that this perceptual learning may orient subsequent feeding behavior of the hatchlings. Laying hens were fed standard food enriched with 2% menhaden oil (MH group) or 2% soybean oil (controls). The scent of menhaden was significantly more detected in MH egg yolks than in control yolks by a human panel. We analyzed the development and behavior of offspring towards different types of food, bearing or not bearing the menhaden scent. When chicks were exposed to a 3-min choice test between the familiar food bearing the menhaden scent and the familiar food without menhaden, no effect of treatment was observed. In a 3-min choice test with unfamiliar food (mashed cereals) MH chicks showed a clear positive orientation toward the unfamiliar food bearing the menhaden scent. By contrast, control chicks showed a preference for the non-odorized unfamiliar food. MH chicks expressed higher emotional reactivity level than control chicks as expressed by food neophobia and longer immobility in a restraint test. Chicks exposed in ovo to menhaden oil via the maternal diet preferentially oriented their feeding behavior towards food containing menhaden oil, but only when the food was unfamiliar. We propose that oil in the maternal diet engenders maternal effects and contributes to the development of behavioral phenotype in the offspring. In ovo chemosensory learning may have evolved to prepare precocial offspring for their environment. This suggests a common principle of embryonic chemosensory learning across vertebrate taxa.},

abstract={The availability and overconsumption of palatable foods rich in fat likely contribute to the worldwide obesity epidemic. With environmental factors and genetic predisposition each playing important roles in this serious health problem, it is crucial to identify and properly treat individuals who have a greater propensity to eat excessive amounts of fatty foods. Animal studies have been instrumental in this regard, allowing researchers to identify and examine early behavioral or physiological factors that are positively associated with and can predict future fat consumption and obesity. The methods for classifying and subgrouping these animals, which are described herein, focus on three early predictive measures, namely, 5-day fat intake, novelty-induced locomotor activity, and fat-induced triglyceride levels, which have all been successfully used to identify outbred rats that are prone (i.e., have higher propensity) or resistant to overeating fat. The early identification based on these three factors of animals prone to overeating fat, in conjunction with tests to characterize their specific phenotype, can yield valuable information regarding the underlying behavioral, physiological, and neurochemical pathways involved in driving excessive fat intake, ultimately leading to an obese state. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The mechanistic basis for and adaptive significance of variation in female sperm storage organs are important for a range of questions concerning sexual selection and speciation, as such variation influences the evolutionary trajectories of male fertilization related traits and may facilitate speciation through its effects on gamete recognition. Female yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria) usually develop three sperm storage compartments, and this subdivision may be an adaptation for sorting sperm during postcopulatory choice. Using lines artificially selected to express four spermathecae (4s), we explored the fitness consequences of the novel phenotype relative to the naturally prevalent three-spermatheca (3s) phenotype by manipulating the opportunity for postcopulatory sexual selection (females mated either with three or only one male prior to oviposition). In addition, we examined the developmental plasticity of spermathecal number in response to different larval food environments and estimated its genetic correlation with growth rate. Mating treatments with and without the opportunity for postcopulatory sexual selection revealed no significant fitness differences between alternative spermathecal phenotypes within selection lines despite overall benefits associated with multiple mating, and moderate egg-to-adult survival costs in response to artificial selection for 4s. Manipulations of the larval food environment revealed that the expression of 4s is highly plastic and tightly linked to environmental conditions promoting fast somatic growth and development. Likewise, siblings with fast intrinsic (genetic) growth were more likely to express 4s within and across food environments. The present results highlight a great potential for rapid evolutionary change in female sperm storage morphology through indirect selection on life-history traits, and further suggest genetic assimilation as a potential mechanism facilitating phylogenetic transitions in spermatheca number as frequently observed within the Dipterans. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Background: Desired serotonin 5HT2 receptor pharmacology for treatment of psychoses is 5HT2A antagonism and/or 5HT2C agonism. No selective 5HT2A antagonist has been approved for psychosis and the only approved 5HT2C agonist (for obesity) also activates 5HT2A and 5HT2B receptors, which can lead to clinical complications. Studies herein tested the hypothesis that a dual-function 5HT2A antagonist/ 5HT2C agonist that does not activate 5HT2B receptors would be suitable for development as an antipsychotic drug, without liability for weight gain. Methods: The novel compounds (+)- and (-)-trans-4-(40-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2-aminotetralin (p-Cl-PAT) were synthesized, characterized in vitro for affinity and functional activity at human 5HT2 receptors, and administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) and oral (gavage) routes to mice in behavioral paradigms that assessed antipsychotic efficacy and effects on feeding behavior. Results: (+)- and (-)-p-Cl-PAT activated 5HT2C receptors, with (+)-p-Cl-PAT being 12-times more potent, consistent with its higher affinity across 5HT2 receptors. Neither p-Cl-PAT enantiomer activated 5HT2A or 5HT2B receptors at concentrations up to 300-times greater than their respective affinity (Ki), and (+)-p-Cl-PAT was shown to be a 5HT2A competitive antagonist. When administered i.p. or orally, (+)- and (-)-p-Cl-PAT attenuated the head-twitch response (HTR) in mice elicited by the 5HT2 agonist (-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and reduced intake of a highly palatable food in nonfood- deprived mice, with (+)-p-Cl-PAT being more potent across behavioral assays. Conclusions: The novel in vitro pharmacology of (+)-p-Cl-PAT (5HT2A antagonism/5HT2C agonism without activation of 5HT2B) translated in vivo to an orally-active drug candidate with preclinical efficacy to treat psychoses without liability for weight gain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Individuals often show consistent behavioural differences where behaviours can form integrated units across functionally different contexts. However, the factors causing and maintaining behavioural syndromes in natural populations remain poorly understood. In this study, we provide evidence for the emergence of a behavioural syndrome during the first months of life in wild brown trout (Salmo trutta). Behavioural traits of trout were scored before and after a 2-month interval covering a major survival bottleneck, whereupon the consistency and covariance of behaviours were analysed. We found that selection favoured individuals with high activity levels in an open-field context, a personality trait consistent throughout the duration of the experiment. In addition, a behavioural syndrome emerged over the 2 months in the wild, linking activity to aggressiveness and exploration tendency. These novel results suggest that behavioural syndromes can emerge rapidly in nature from interaction between natural selection and behavioural plasticity affecting single behaviours. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Antipredator behaviour is an important fitness component in most animals. A co-evolutionary history between predator and prey is important for prey to respond adaptively to predation threats. When non-native predator species invade new areas, native prey may not recognise them or may lack effective antipredator defences. However, responses to novel predators can be facilitated by chemical cues from the predators' diet. The red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is a widespread invasive predator in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, where it preys upon native anuran tadpoles. In a laboratory experiment we studied behavioural antipredator defences (alterations in activity level and spatial avoidance of predator) of nine anurans in response to P. clarkii chemical cues, and compared them with the defences towards a native predator, the larval dragonfly Aeshna sp. To investigate how chemical cues from consumed conspecifics shape the responses, we raised tadpoles with either a tadpole-fed or starved crayfish, or dragonfly larva, or in the absence of a predator. Five species significantly altered their behaviour in the presence of crayfish, and this was largely mediated by chemical cues from consumed conspecifics. In the presence of dragonflies, most species exhibited behavioural defences and often these did not require the presence of cues from predation events. Responding to cues from consumed conspecifics seems to be a critical factor in facilitating certain behavioural responses to novel exotic predators. This finding can be useful for predicting antipredator responses to invasive predators and help directing conservation efforts to the species at highest risk. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Understanding the social organization of group-living organisms is crucial for the comprehension of the underlying selective mechanisms involved in the evolution of cooperation. Division of labour and caste formation is restricted to eusocial organisms, but behavioural asymmetries and reproductive skew is common in other group-living animals. Permanently, social spiders form highly related groups with reproductive skew and communal brood care. We investigated task differentiation in nonreproductive tasks in two permanently and independently derived social spider species asking the following questions: Do individual spiders vary consistently in their propensity to engage in prey attack? Are individual spiders' propensities to engage in web maintenance behaviour influenced by their previous engagement in prey attack? Interestingly, we found that both species showed some degree of task specialization, but in distinctly different ways: Stegodyphus sarasinorum showed behavioural asymmetries at the individual level, that is, individual spiders that had attacked prey once were more likely to attack prey again, independent of their body size or hunger level. In contrast, Anelosimus eximius showed no individual specialization, but showed differentiation according to instar, where adult and subadult females were more likely to engage in prey attack than were juveniles. We found no evidence for division of labour between prey attack and web maintenance. Different solutions to achieve task differentiation in prey attack for the two species studied here suggest an adaptive value of task specialization in foraging for social spiders. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Muscle activity during exercise generates significant heat production creating a challenge for the body’s temperature regulating system even under mild conditions. Because sweat evaporation is the primary method for humans to cool the body, athletes can lose significant amounts of water during exercise. Fluid losses vary greatly across different sports and among individual athletes, ranging from 0.5 to 2.6 L/h. Sweat losses are even greater when exercise is performed in hot and humid conditions. Depending on the magnitude of the sweating response and drinking behavior of the athlete, fluid imbalances such as dehydration and hyponatremia can develop, leading to poor performance, increased risks of heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and in extreme circumstances, brain damage or even death. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={L-Carnitine, a natural vitamin-like compound supplied to the body by biosynthesis and dietary sources, has been shown to exert beneficial effects in disorders affecting cardiovascular, urinary, and nervous systems. However, the paucity of data on its effects does not guarantee the safe use of L-carnitine as a nutritional supplement, and further pre-clinical studies are required to assess toxicological aspects. The present study evaluated the effects of L-carnitine (10, 50 or, 100 mg/kg) inmice, in the open field test. Also, lipoperoxidation was assessed measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and genotoxic/antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the comet assay in several tissues. L-Carnitine 50 mg/kg impaired exploration, though with no effects on habituation to a novel environment. L-Carnitine increased TBARS in the brain and liver tissues, but it did not induce genotoxicity in any tissue. In ex vivo comet assay, a decrease inDNA damage in the blood and liver tissueswas observed,while the opposite occurred in the brain tissue. In conclusion, L-carnitinemay increase lipid peroxidation, though without inducing genotoxic effects, protect DNA against endogenous and induced oxidative damages in blood and liver; however, L-carnitine impaired exploratory behavior and increased the vulnerability of the brain tissue to oxidative stress, suggesting that the excessive consumption of L-carnitine may promote deleterious effects on the central nervous system. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Conclusions: SSBs vary in the quantity and nature of sugars they contain; however, all of the sugars are fermentable by oral bacteria and potentially cariogenic. Practical Implications: Oral health care practitioners should assess patients' SSB intakes by asking questions regarding the quantity, frequency and duration of SSB intake. In response to individual behaviors, practitioners should tailor recommendations when providing anticipatory guidance to help patients decrease their exposure to SSBs for caries prevention. In light of the association between SSB intake and caries risk, as well as the increased consumption of SSBs, all dental practices should assess patients' SSBs intake.},

abstract={Longevity and ageing are two sides of a coin, leaving the question open as to which one is the cause and which one the effect. At the individual level, the physiological rate of ageing determines the length of life (= individual longevity, as long as death results from old age and not from disease or other impacts). Individual longevity depends on the direct influence of environmental conditions with respect to nutrition, and the possibility for and timing of reproduction, as well as on the energetic costs animals invest in behavioural and physiological stress defence. All these environmental effectors influence hormonal and cellular signalling pathways that modify the individual physiological condition, the reproductive strategy, and the rate of ageing. At the species level, longevity (= maximum lifespan) is the result of an evolutionary process and, thus, largely determined by the species' behavioural and physiological adaptations to its ecological niche. Specifically, reproductive and breeding strategies have to be optimized in relation to local environmental conditions in different habitats. As a result of adaptive and evolutionary processes, species longevity is genetically underpinned, not necessarily by a few ageing genes, but by an evolutionary process that has hierarchically shaped and optimized species genomes to function in a specific niche or environmental system. Importantly, investigations and reviews attempting to unravel the mechanistic basis of the ageing process need to differentiate clearly between the evolutionary process shaping longevity at the species level and the regulatory mechanisms that alter the individual rate of ageing. © 2013 S.

abstract={Trade-offs are inherent to alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), and identifying the costs and benefits of tactics is essential to understanding their evolution and maintenance within a population. Male horseshoe crabs exhibit two condition-dependent ARTs: males that are in better condition arrive on spawning beaches attached to a female, while males in poorer condition join spawning pairs as satellites and engage in sperm competition. Previous research has identified several benefits to the attached tactic, but the costs are less well understood. We examined a previously uninvestigated potential cost to the attached male tactic: nutritional stress caused by a restricted ability to feed. We found that field-caught attached males produced 57% less faeces in a 12h period than satellite males, and had 2.5 times emptier digestive tracts than satellite males. We further examined this cost using stable isotopes because nutritionally stressed animals are predicted to have higher δ15N levels. We found that field-caught attached males had higher δ15N values than satellite males. However, higher δ15N values could result from nutritional stress or from feeding on higher trophic levels. We tested this experimentally and found that starved animals had higher post-treatment δ15N values compared to animals that were fed. Furthermore, the digestive tracts of field-caught attached males contained three times more sea grass (lower tropic levels have lower δ15N values) than satellite males. These findings mean that the higher δ15N values of field-caught attached males likely result from fasting rather than differences in diet. Taken together, our results indicate that a period of nutritional stress caused by reduced food consumption is a novel cost of the attached tactic. This study provides a key piece of information to explain why ARTs in horseshoe crabs take the form they do and provides a novel method for studying costs associated with ARTs in other species. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Low birthweight, a marker of an adverse in utero environment, is associated with cardiometabolic disease and brain disorders in adulthood. The adaptive changes made by the fetus in response to the intra-uterine environment result in permanent changes in physiology, structure and metabolism, a phenomenon termed early life programming. One of the key hypotheses to explain programming, namely over exposure of the developing fetus to glucocorticoids, was proposed nearly two decades ago, following the observation that the fetus was protected from high glucocorticoid levels in the mother by the actions of the placental barrier enzyme, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts active glucocorticoids into inactive products. Numerous mechanistic studies in animal models have been carried out to test this hypothesis using manipulations to increase maternal glucocorticoids. Overall, these have resulted in offspring of lower birthweight, with an activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and an adverse metabolic profile and behavioural phenotype in adulthood. Altered glucocorticoid activity or action is a good candidate mechanism in humans to link low birthweight with cardiometabolic and brain disorders. We have carried out detailed studies in men and women showing that high levels of endogenous glucocorticoids, or treatment with exogenous glucocorticoids, is associated with an adverse metabolic profile, increased cardiovascular disease and altered mood and cognitive decline. Our laboratory carried out the first translational studies in humans to test the glucocorticoid hypothesis, firstly demonstrating in studies of adult men and women, that low birthweight was associated with high fasting cortisol levels. We went on to dissect the mechanisms underlying the high fasting cortisol, demonstrating activation of the HPA axis, with increased cortisol responses to stimulation with exogenous adrenocorticotrophin hormone, lack of habituation to the stress of venepuncture, and increased cortisol responses to psychosocial stress. We have developed new dynamic tests to dissect the mechanisms regulating HPA axis central negative feedback sensitivity in humans, and demonstrated that this may be altered in obesity, one component of the metabolic syndrome. There are now studies in humans demonstrating that high circulating levels of maternal cortisol during pregnancy correlate negatively with birthweight, suggesting that excess glucocorticoids can by-pass the placental barrier. Deficiencies in the barrier enzyme, potentially increasing fetal glucocorticoid exposure, can also arise in association with maternal stress, malnutrition and disease, and can be inhibited by consumption of liquorice, which contains glycyrrhizin, an HSD inhibitor. Importantly, studies in humans have now demonstrated that high maternal cortisol in pregnancy and/or inhibition of HSD2 are associated with programmed outcomes in childhood including higher blood pressure, behavioural disorders as well as altered brain structure. We are investigating this further, using novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques to study the developing fetal brain in utero. The translational studies in support of the glucocorticoid hypothesis, and demonstrating that glucocorticoids are both mediators and targets of programming, are exciting and raise the question of whether this information can be used to identify those individuals most at risk of later life disease. In a recent study we showed that alterations in DNA methylation at genes important in regulating cortisol levels, tissue glucocorticoid action, blood pressure and fetal growth, are present in adulthood in association with both early life parameters and cardiometabolic risk factors. These preliminary data add to the limited literature in humans indicating a persisting epigenetic link between early life events and subsequent disease risk. Such findings open novel avenues for further exploration of the contribution of glucocorticoids to later life disease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: Obesity often clusters with other major cardiovascular disease risk factors, yet a subset of the obese appears to be protected from these risks. Two obesity phenotypes are described, (i) "metabolically healthy" obese, broadly defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 and favorable levels of blood pressure, lipids, and glucose; and (ii) "at risk" obese, BMI ≥ 30 with unfavorable levels of these risk factors. More than 30% of obese American adults are metabolically healthy. Diet and activity determinants of obesity phenotypes are unclear. We hypothesized that metabolically healthy obese have more favorable behavioral factors, including less adverse diet composition and higher activity levels than at risk obese in the multi-ethnic group of 775 obese American adults ages 40-59 years from the International Population Study on Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP) cohort. Design and Methods: In gender-stratified analyses, mean values for diet composition and activity behavior variables, adjusted for age, race, and education, were compared between metabolically healthy and at risk obese. Results: Nearly one in five (149/775 or 19%) of obese American INTERMAP participants were classified as metabolically healthy obese. Diet composition and most activity behaviors were similar between obesity phenotypes, although metabolically healthy obese women reported higher sleep duration than at risk obese women. Conclusions: These results do not support hypotheses that diet composition and/or physical activity account for the absence of cardiometabolic abnormalities in metabolically healthy obese.

abstract={Background: A preference for sweet tastes has been repeatedly shown to be associated with alcohol preference in both animals and humans. In this study, we tested the extent to which recent drinking is related to blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation from an intensely sweet solution in orbitofrontal areas known to respond to primary rewards. Methods: Sixteen right-handed, non-treatment-seeking, healthy volunteers (mean age: 26 years; 75% male) were recruited from the community. All underwent a taste test using a range of sucrose concentrations, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during pseudorandom, event-driven stimulation with water and a 0.83 M concentration of sucrose in water. Results: [Sucrose > water] provoked a significant BOLD activation in primary gustatory cortex and amygdala, as well as in the right ventral striatum and in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Drinks/drinking day correlated significantly with the activation as extracted from the left orbital area (r = 0.52, p = 0.04 after correcting for a bilateral comparison). Using stepwise multiple regression, the addition of rated sucrose liking accounted for significantly more variance in drinks/drinking day than did left orbital activation alone (multiple R = 0.79, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Both the orbitofrontal response to an intensely sweet taste and rated liking of that taste accounted for significant variance in drinking behavior. The brain response to sweet tastes may be an important phenotype of alcoholism risk. © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

abstract={Competition is ubiquitous among social animals. Vying against a conspecific to achieve a particular outcome often requires one to act aggressively, but this is a costly and inherently risky behavior. So why do we aggressively compete, or at the extreme, fight against others? Early work suggested that competitive aggression might stem from an innate aggressive tendency, emanating from subcortical structures. Later work highlighted key cortical regions that contribute toward an instrumental aggression network, one that is recruited or suppressed as needed to achieve a goal. Recent neuroimaging work hints that competitive aggression is upmost a cost-benefit decision, in that it appears to recruit many components of traditional, non-social decision-making networks. This review provides a historical glimpse into the neuroscience of competitive aggression, and proposes a conceptual advancement for studying competitive behavior by outlining how utility calculations of contested-for resources are skewed, pre- and post-competition. A basic multi-factorial model of utility assessment is proposed to account for competitive endowment effects that stem from the presence of peers, peer salience and disposition, and the tactical effort required for victory. In part, competitive aggression is a learned behavior that should only be repeated if positive outcomes are achieved. However, due to skewed utility assessments, deviations of associative learning occur. Hence truly careful cost-benefit analysis is warranted before choosing to vie against another. A critical consideration in social decision-making is whether or not to compete against a conspecific. Competitive action can take many forms, for example it could involve a quick, direct, physical fight between two individuals, or long, covert, strategic manoeuvres between groups. In all of its forms, competitive engagement carries the implicit goal of outperforming conspecifics in order to achieve resources or other outcomes that facilitate self-preservation. Direct competitive aggression is one of the most observable forms of competitive engagement amongst social animals. This specific form of competitive action is frequently required to obtain or protect a resource, but it is energetically costly and inherently risky. So how do we know when (or when not) to put up a fight? Early investigations in psychoanalysis, ethology and neuroscience suggested that animals have an innate aggressive drive, stemming from basally active subcortical networks. While this idea might explain the behavior of certain characters from the 1990's media phenomenon Fight Club, it does not fit well with common patterns of animal behavior. Socially, constant aggressive tendencies would create a tense and nihilistic world. Physiologically, subcortical circuits that were basally active would require an inordinate amount of cortical energy to suppress. It would be more evolutionarily advantageous for animals to have an instrumental aggression network (IAN), one that can be recruited for competitive action only when it's worthwhile to compete. Determining whether competitive aggression is worthwhile represents a cost-benefit decision, largely reliant on the same neural networks that process non-social decision variables. There is an outcome at stake that you want. How much do you want it and what costs will be incurred in obtainment? Reward valuation and cost assessment are paramount. The presence of others who also want that same outcome simply makes for multi-factorial cost-benefit analysis. Peer interest should enhance the utility of the outcome, providing an endowment effect that can be modulated by the composition of the peer group, and the expected ferocity of their competitive tactics. Expended competitive effort can discount the utility of the outcome, but can also provide an immediate endowment effect of deservingness for the victor. Multi-factorial cost-benefit analysis thus structures competitive aggression, informing us when and when not to put up a fight. © 2013 Hillman.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To describe parental vaccine decision making behaviors and characterize trust in physician advice among parents with varying childhood vaccination behaviors. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2011, a mixed methods study was conducted with parents of children aged <4 years who were members of Kaiser Permanente Colorado health plan. Seven focus groups were conducted with vaccine-hesitant parents. On the basis of findings from the focus groups, a survey was developed, pilot tested, and mailed to a stratified sample of 854 parents who accepted (n = 500), delayed (n = 227), or refused (n = 127) vaccinations for one of their children. Survey results were analyzed by chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Several themes emerged from the focus groups, including: 1) the vaccine decision-making process begins prenatally, 2) vaccine decision making is an evolving process, and 3) there is overall trust in the pediatrician but a lack of trust in the information they provided about vaccines. The survey response rate was 52% (n = 443). Parents who refused or delayed vaccines were 2 times more likely to report that they began thinking about vaccines before their child was born and 8 times more likely to report that they constantly reevaluate their vaccine decisions than parents who accepted all vaccines. Although parents tended to report trusting their pediatrician's advice on nutrition, behavior, and the physical examination, they did not believe their pediatrician provided "balanced" information on both the benefits and risks of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for future interventions to address parental vaccination concerns. Such interventions may be more effective if they are applied early (during pregnancy) and often (pregnancy through infancy), and cover both the risks and benefits of vaccination.

abstract={Pediatric obesity is a serious medical condition associated with significant comorbidities during childhood and adulthood. Lifestyle modifications are essential for treating children with obesity, yet many have insufficient response to improve health with behavioral approaches alone. This review summarizes the relatively sparse data on pharmacotherapy for pediatric obesity and presents information on obesity medications in development. Most previously studied medications demonstrated, at best, modest effects on body weight and obesity-related conditions. It is to be hoped that the future will bring new drugs targeting specific obesity phenotypes that will allow clinicians to use etiology-specific, and therefore more effective, anti-obesity therapies. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={The core defining features of bulimia nervosa (BN) are repeated binge eating episodes and inappropriate compensatory (e.g., purging) behavior. Previous studies suggest an abnormal post-prandial response in the satiety-signaling peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) in persons with BN. It is unknown whether this altered response persists following remission or if it may be a potential target for the development of clinical treatment strategies. To examine the nature of this altered response, this study assessed whether CCK normalizes following remission from BN (RBN). This study prospectively evaluated the plasma CCK response and corresponding eating behavior-related ratings (e.g., satiety, fullness, hunger, urge to binge and vomit) in individuals with BN-purging subtype (n=10), RBN-purging subtype (n=14), and healthy controls (CON, n=13) at baseline, +. 15, +. 30, and +. 60. min following the ingestion of a standardized liquid test meal.Subject groups did not significantly differ in CCK response to the test meal. A significant relationship between CCK response and satiety ratings was observed in the RBN group (r=.59, p<.05 two-tailed). A new and unanticipated finding in the BN group was a significant relationship between CCK response and ratings of "urge to vomit" (r=.86, p<.01, two-tailed).Unlike previous investigations, CCK response did not differ in BN and CON groups. Thus the role of symptom severity remains an area of further investigation. Additionally, findings suggest that in this sample, CCK functioning following remission from BN-purging subtype is not different from controls. It remains unknown whether or not CCK functioning may be a protective or liability factor in the stabilization and recovery process. Replication studies utilizing a larger sample size are needed to further elucidate the role of CCK in recovery from BN and its potential target of related novel treatment strategies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Obese individuals tend to behave more impulsively than healthy weight individuals across a variety of measures, but it is unclear whether this pattern can be altered. The present study examined the effects of a mindful eating behavioral strategy on impulsive and risky choice patterns for hypothetical food and money. In Experiment 1, 304 participants completed computerized delay and probability discounting tasks for food-related and monetary outcomes. High percent body fat (PBF) predicted more impulsive choice for food, but not small-value money, replicating previous work. In Experiment 2, 102 randomly selected participants from Experiment 1 were assigned to participate in a 50-minworkshop on mindful eating or to watch an educational video. They then completed the discounting tasks again. Participants who completed the mindful eating session showed more self-controlled and less risk-averse discounting patterns for food compared to baseline; those in the control condition discounted similarly to baseline rates. There were no changes in discounting for money for either group, suggesting stimulus specificity for food for the mindful eating condition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent health conditions, and a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the globe. Once thought of primarily as a disease of men, COPD is now known to be increasingly prevalent among women. Although increasing tobacco consumption among women during the past several decades might explain some of this increase, the relationship may be more complex, including factors such as differential susceptibility to tobacco, anatomic and hormonal differences, behavioral differences, and differences in response to available therapeutic modalities. Moreover, women with COPD may present differently, may have a different pattern of comorbidities, and may have a better survival after acute exacerbations. Care providers continue to have a gender bias that may affect both diagnosis and treatment. Future work should focus on factors that lead to gender differences in COPD as well as gender-specific treatment strategies. © 2013 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Although consumption of drinking water contaminated with inorganic arsenic is usually considered the primary exposure route, aggregate exposure to arsenic depends on direct consumption of water, use of water in food preparation, and the presence in arsenicals in foods. To gain insight into the effects of biological and behavioral factors on arsenic exposure, we determined arsenic concentrations in urine and toenails in a U.S. population that uses public or private water supplies containing inorganic arsenic. Study participants were 904 adult residents of Churchill County, Nevada, whose home tap water supplies contained <3 to about 1200 μg of arsenic per liter. Biomarkers of exposure for this study were summed urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites (speciated arsenical), of all urinary arsenicals (total arsenical), and of all toenail arsenicals (total arsenical). Increased tap water arsenic concentration and consumption were associated with significant upward trends for urinary speciated and total and toenail total arsenical concentrations. Significant gender differences in concentrations of speciated and total arsenicals in urine and toenails reflected male-female difference in water intake. Both recent and higher habitual seafood consumption significantly increased urinary total but not speciated arsenical concentration. In a stepwise general linear model, seafood consumption significantly predicted urinary total arsenical but not urinary speciated or toenail total arsenical concentrations. Smoking behavior significantly predicted urinary speciated or total arsenical concentration. Gender, tap water arsenic concentration, and primary drinking water source significantly predicted urinary speciated and total concentrations and toenail total arsenical concentrations. These findings confirm the primacy of home tap water as a determinant of arsenic concentration in urine and toenails. However, biological and behavioral factors can modify exposure-response relations for these biomarkers. Refining estimates of the influence of these factors will permit better models of dose-response relations for this important environmental contaminant. © 2013.},

abstract={Neurodevelopmental changes in mesolimbic regions are associated with adolescent risk-taking behavior. Numerous studies have shown exaggerated activation in the striatum in adolescents compared with children and adults during reward processing. However, striatal sensitivity to aversion remains elusive. Given the important role of the striatum in tracking both appetitive and aversive events, addressing this question is critical to understanding adolescent decision-making, as both positive and negative factors contribute to this behavior. In this study, human adult and adolescent participants performed a task in which they received squirts of appetitive or aversive liquid while undergoing fMRI, a novel approach in human adolescents. Compared with adults, adolescents showed greater behavioral and striatal sensitivity to both appetitive and aversive stimuli, an effect that was exaggerated in response to delivery of the aversive stimulus. Collectively, these findings contribute to understanding how neural responses to positive and negative outcomes differ between adolescents and adults and how they may influence adolescent behavior. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={The life history of tropical birds differs from that of their temperate counterparts by late start of reproduction, small clutch sizes, and high rates of adult survival. Thus, tropical species should have greater residual reproductive value than temperate species. Therefore, tropical birds can be predicted to take smaller risks than closely related temperate birds in order not to jeopardize their prospects of survival, which is the single most important component of fitness, and which is greater in tropical than in temperate species. We estimated flight distances as a measure of risk-taking behavior of common species of birds for populations living in tropical areas in China (mainly Hainan) and in temperate Europe (mainly Denmark and France), predicting that flight distances should be longer in tropical than in temperate populations, and that the difference in flight distance between these 2 environments should be positively correlated with the difference in clutch size. Mean flight distance was more than twice as large in tropical compared with temperate populations for 25 pairs of taxa. The difference in flight distance between tropical and temperate taxa decreased with the difference in clutch size between the 2 environments. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tropical birds take smaller risks than closely related temperate taxa to minimize the risk of early death due to predation. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={Activity rhythms are ubiquitous in nature, and generally synchronized with the day-night cycle. Several taxa have been shown to switch between nocturnal and diurnal activity in response to environmental variability, and these relatively uncommon switches provide a basis for greater understanding of the mechanisms and adaptive significance of circadian (approx. 24 h) rhythms. Plasticity of activity rhythms has been identified in association with a variety of factors, from changes in predation pressure to an altered nutritional or social status. Here, we report a switch in activity rhythm that is associated with rainfall. Outside periods of rain, the estuarine-associated teleost Acanthopagrus australis was most active and in shallower depths during the day, but this activity and depth pattern was reversed in the days following rain, with diurnality restored as estuarine conductivity and turbidity levels returned to pre-rain levels. Although representing the first example of a rain-induced reversal of activity rhythm in an aquatic animal of which we are aware, our results are consistent with established models on the trade-offs between predation risk and foraging efficiency. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Evolutionary and life history perspectives allow a fuller understanding of both patterns of growth and development and variations in disease risk. Evolutionary processes act to ensure successful reproduction and not the preservation of health and longevity, and this entails trade-offs both between traits and across the life course. Developmental plasticity adjusts the developmental trajectory so that the phenotype in childhood and through peak reproduction will suit predicted environmental conditions-a capacity that may become maladaptive should early-life predictions be inaccurate. Bipedalism and consequent pelvic narrowing in humans have led to the evolution of secondary altricialism. Shorter inter-birth intervals enabled by appropriate social support structures have allowed increased fecundity/fitness. The age at puberty has fallen over the past two centuries, perhaps resulting from changes in maternal and infant health and nutrition. The timing of puberty is also advanced by conditions of high extrinsic mortality in hunter-gatherers and is reflected in developed countries where a poor or disadvantaged start to life may also accelerate maturation. The postpubertal individual is physically and psychosexually mature, but neural executive function only reaches full maturity in the third decade of life; this mismatch may account for increased adolescent morbidity and mortality in those with earlier pubertal onset.

abstract={Seasonal polyphenisms are widespread in nature, yet the selective pressures responsible for their evolution remain poorly understood. Previous work has largely focussed either on the developmental regulation of seasonal polyphenisms or putative 'top-down' selective pressures such as predation that may have acted to drive phenotypic divergence. Much less is known about the influence of seasonal variation in resource availability or seasonal selection on optimal resource allocation. We studied seasonal variation in resource availability, uptake and allocation in Araschnia levana L., a butterfly species that exhibits a striking seasonal colour polyphenism consisting of predominantly orange 'spring form' adults and black-and-white 'summer form' adults. 'Spring form' individuals develop as larvae in the late summer, enter a pupal diapause in the fall and emerge in the spring, whereas 'summer form' individuals develop directly during the summer months. We find evidence for seasonal declines in host plant quality, and we identify similar reductions in resource uptake in late summer, 'spring form' larvae. Further, we report shifts in the body composition of diapausing 'spring form' pupae consistent with a physiological cost to overwintering. However, these differences do not translate into detectable differences in adult body composition. Instead, we find minor seasonal differences in adult body composition consistent with augmented flight capacity in 'summer form' adults. In comparison, we find much stronger signatures of sex-specific selection on patterns of resource uptake and allocation. Our results indicate that resource dynamics in A. levana are shaped by seasonal fluctuations in host plant nutrition, climatic conditions and intraspecific interactions. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, are psychiatric disorders with physical complications. Several factors may contribute to the onset of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, including a familial predisposition to these disorders as well as individual personality characteristics. Dissatisfaction with body shape and an overwhelming desire to be thin are considered as risk factors for the development of eating disorders. Skin signs are the expression of the medical consequences of starvation, vomiting, abuse of drugs, such as laxatives and diuretics, and psychiatric morbidity. They include xerosis, lanugolike body hair, telogen effluvium, carotenoderma, acne, hyperpigmentation, seborrheic dermatitis, acrocyanosis, perniosis, petechiae, livedo reticularis, interdigital intertrigo, paronychia, acquired striae distensae, and acral coldness. The most characteristic cutaneous sign of vomiting is Russell sign (knuckle calluses). Symptoms due to laxative or diuretic abuse include adverse reactions to drugs. Symptoms due to psychiatric morbidity (artefacta) include the consequences of self-induced trauma. The role of the dermatologist in the management of eating disorders is to make an early diagnosis of the "hidden"signs of eating disorders in patients who tend to minimize or deny their disorder. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Only little is known about behaviour and stress responses in horses with gastric ulceration, despite the high prevalence of this condition. Our objectives in the present study was to (i) describe the severity of gastric ulceration in horses, housed under relatively standardised conditions, and (ii) to investigate whether horses with severe glandular gastric ulceration have increased baseline and response concentration of stress hormones and behave differently than control horses. We investigated stomachs of 96 horses at one stud, and compared an ulcer group (n=30; with severe lesions in the glandular mucosa) to paired controls (n=30; free from gastric ulcers). Baseline and response concentrations of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM), heart rate and behaviour were measured in a novel object test (NOT, Day 1) and behaviour during postponed feeding (PF, Day 2). Glandular lesions occurred in 55.2% and non-glandular lesions in 40.6% of the horses. The amount of starch in the feed (P=0.006) and paternal stallion (P=0.031) influenced ulceration in the non-glandular region only; it should be noted that our study does not allow for separating hereditary from environmental influences, as offspring may be e.g. trained differently dependent on breeding line. Ulcer horses pawed more (P<0.001) and ate quicker (P=0.050) during PF. Although displayed by ulcers horses only during PF, we failed to demonstrate a significant association between glandular gastric ulceration and crib-biting/weaving; the total number of horses with these types of abnormal behaviour was low (n=5). Behaviour and heart rate did not differ between groups in the NOT. Baseline concentration of FCM was similar (P=0.79), however, ulcer horses responded stronger to novelty than controls (26% higher FCM; P=0.018). We conclude that the prevalence of gastric ulcers was high, and our results suggest different factors affecting ulceration in the glandular versus the non-glandular region of the horse stomach. Obvious external signs (e.g. poor body condition) identifying ulcer horses were absent. Horses with severe glandular ulcers had a higher stress hormone response to novelty, thus they were more stress sensitive. Consequently, management evoking stress in horses should be reduced to dampen the development of glandular ulceration, or to protect horses with this condition. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Prenatal or embryonic learning, behavioral change following experience made prior to birth, may have significant consequences for postnatal foraging behavior in a wide variety of animals, including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and molluscs. However, prenatal learning has not been previously shown in arthropods such as insects, spiders and mites. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined prenatal chemosensory learning in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus. We exposed these predators in the embryonic stage to two flavors (vanillin or anisaldehyde) or no flavor (neutral) by feeding their mothers on spider mite prey enriched with these flavors or not enriched with any flavor (neutral). After the predators reached the protonymphal stage, we assessed their prey choice through residence and feeding preferences in experiments, in which they were offered spider mites matching the maternal diet (neutral, vanillin or anisaldehyde spider mites) and non-matching spider mites. Predator protonymphs preferentially resided in the vicinity of spider mites matching the maternal diet irrespective of the type of maternal diet and choice situation. Across treatments, the protonymphs preferentially fed on spider mites matching the maternal diet. Prey and predator sizes did not differ among neutral, vanillin and anisaldehyde treatments, excluding the hypothesis that size-assortative predation influenced the outcome of the experiments. Conclusions/Significance: Our study reports the first example of prenatal learning in arthropods. © 2012 Peralta Quesada and Schausberger.},

The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) Public Policy Leadership Group reviewed the CMS decision and has issued a position statement. SBM is in support of the CMS decision to cover intensive behavior therapy for obesity but expresses significant concern that aspects of the decision will severely limit the impact of the decision. Concerns focus on the degree to which this care can be feasibly implemented in its current form given the limitations in providers who are covered and the short length of counseling visits relative to evidence-based protocols. SBM is in strong support of modifications that would include providers who have expertise in weight control (e. g., psychologists and dietitians) and to expand the treatment time to better match protocols with confirmed efficacy. © 2012 Society of Behavioral Medicine.},

abstract={Previously, we have shown that a maternal low protein diet, fed exclusively during the preimplantation period of mouse development (Emb-LPD), is sufficient to induce by the blastocyst stage a compensatory growth phenotype in late gestation and postnatally, correlating with increased risk of adult onset cardiovascular disease and behavioural dysfunction. Here, we examine mechanisms of induction of maternal Emb-LPD programming and early compensatory responses by the embryo. Emb-LPD induced changes in maternal serum metabolites at the time of blastocyst formation (E3.5), notably reduced insulin and increased glucose, together with reduced levels of free amino acids (AAs) including branched chain AAs leucine, isoleucine and valine. Emb-LPD also caused reduction in the branched chain AAs within uterine fluid at the blastocyst stage. These maternal changes coincided with an altered content of blastocyst AAs and reduced mTORC1 signalling within blastocysts evident in reduced phosphorylation of effector S6 ribosomal protein and its ratio to total S6 protein but no change in effector 4E-BP1 phosphorylated and total pools. These changes were accompanied by increased proliferation of blastocyst trophectoderm and total cells and subsequent increased spreading of trophoblast cells in blastocyst outgrowths. We propose that induction of metabolic programming following Emb-LPD is achieved through mTORC1signalling which acts as a sensor for preimplantation embryos to detect maternal nutrient levels via branched chain AAs and/or insulin availability. Moreover, this induction step associates with changes in extra-embryonic trophectoderm behaviour occurring as early compensatory responses leading to later nutrient recovery. © 2012 Fleming et al.},

abstract={During the reproductive season, sea turtles use a restricted area in the vicinity of their nesting beaches, making them vulnerable to predation. At Raine Island (Australia), the highest density green turtle Chelonia mydas rookery in the world, tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier have been observed to feed on green turtles, and it has been suggested that they may specialise on such air-breathing prey. However there is little information with which to examine this hypothesis. We compared the spatial and temporal components of movement behaviour of these two potentially interacting species in order to provide insight into the predator-prey relationship. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that tiger shark movements are more concentrated at Raine Island during the green turtle nesting season than outside the turtle nesting season when turtles are not concentrated at Raine Island. Turtles showed area-restricted search behaviour around Raine Island for ~3-4 months during the nesting period (November-February). This was followed by direct movement (transit) to putative foraging grounds mostly in the Torres Straight where they switched to area-restricted search mode again, and remained resident for the remainder of the deployment (53-304 days). In contrast, tiger sharks displayed high spatial and temporal variation in movement behaviour which was not closely linked to the movement behaviour of green turtles or recognised turtle foraging grounds. On average, tiger sharks were concentrated around Raine Island throughout the year. While information on diet is required to determine whether tiger sharks are turtle specialists our results support the hypothesis that they target this predictable and plentiful prey during turtle nesting season, but they might not focus on this less predictable food source outside the nesting season. © 2012 Fitzpatrick et al.},

abstract={Background: Effective methods of secondary prevention after stroke or TIA are available but adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is often poor. The study aimed to determine the quality of secondary prevention in usual care and to develop a stepwise modeled support program. Methods: Two consecutive cohorts of patients with acute minor stroke or TIA undergoing usual outpatient care versus a secondary prevention program were compared. Risk factor control and medication adherence were assessed in 6-month follow-ups (6M-FU). Usual care consisted of detailed information concerning vascular risk factor targets given at discharge and regular outpatient care by primary care physicians. The stepwise modeled support program additionally employed up to four outpatient appointments. A combination of educational and behavioral strategies was employed. Results: 168 patients in the observational cohort who stated their openness to participate in a prevention program (mean age 64.7 y, admission blood pressure (BP): 155/84 mmHg) and 173 patients participating in the support program (mean age 67.6 y, BP: 161/84 mmHg) were assessed at 6 months. Proportions of patients with BP according to guidelines were 50% in usual-care and 77% in the support program (p<0.01). LDL<100 mg/dl was measured in 62 versus 71% (p = 0.12). Proportions of patients who stopped smoking were 50 versus 79% (p<0.01). 72 versus 89% of patients with atrial fibrillation were on oral anticoagulation (p = 0.09). Conclusions: Risk factor control remains unsatisfactory in usual care. Targets of secondary prevention were met more often within the supported cohort. Effects on (cerebro-)vascular recurrence rates are going to be assessed in a multicenter randomized trial. © 2012 Leistner et al.},

abstract={Laboratory rats display pronounced defensive behaviors when confronted with a range of cat-derived stimuli, including collars worn by a cat, cloths rubbed on a cat, and cat fur. One possible explanation of this phenomenon (the "kairomone hypothesis") is that rats derive a survival advantage by eavesdropping on signals used by cats to communicate with each other. Cats are known to rub their bodies on objects at strategic environmental locations to signal their identity and mating potential to other cats. The current study assessed the sensitivity of laboratory rats to these body rubbings. In Experiment 1, food deprived Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to consume food pellets in one arm of a Y maze. On test day a damp cloth was placed near the food pellets that had been rubbed on a location (wall) where a cat had recently engaged in body rubbing. A control cloth and a collar worn by the cat were also tested. The presence of both the body rubbing residue and the cat collar increased latency to eat and decreased amount of food eaten. The disruption of consummatory behavior in the test environment was still evident 24. h later in the absence of odor stimuli. Experiment 2 tested the reaction of naïve Wistar rats to body rubbings using a paradigm in which rats were given the opportunity to hide. Relative to a control condition, rats exposed to a cotton pad wiped on a cat body rubbing location showed increased hiding behavior, decreased exploration and reduced stimulus approach and investigation. These defensive responses persisted for up to 4. days following a single stimulus exposure. These results suggest that rats eavesdrop readily on body rubbings cats use for identification purposes, providing further support for a kairomone hypothesis of predator odor avoidance. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Individual variations in child weight can be explained by genetic and behavioural susceptibility to obesity. Behavioural susceptibility can be expressed in appetite-related traits, e.g. food responsiveness. Research into such behavioural factors is important, as it can provide starting points for (preventive) interventions. Objectives: To examine associations of children's appetitive traits with weight and with fruit, snack and sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and to examine whether parenting style interacts with appetite in determining child weight/intake. Methods: Data were used from 1275 children participating in the INPACT study in 2009-2010, with a mean age of 9 years in 2009. Their height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). Parents completed a questionnaire to measure children's appetitive traits, children's dietary intake and parenting style. Child BMI z-scores, fruit, snack and sugar-sweetened beverage intake were regressed on appetitive traits. Moderation by parenting style was tested by adding interaction terms to the regression analyses. Results: Food-approaching appetitive traits were positively, and food-avoidant appetitive traits were negatively related to child BMI z-scores and to child fruit intake. There were no or less consistent associations for snack and sugar-sweetened beverage intake. Authoritative parenting voided the negative association between food fussiness and fruit intake, while neglecting parenting strengthened the positive association between food-approaching appetitive traits and weight. Conclusions: Early assessment of appetitive traits could be used to identify children at risk for overweight. As parenting style can moderate the associations between appetitive traits and weight/intake in a favourable way, parents are a promising target group for preventive interventions aimed at influencing the effect of appetitive traits on children. © 2012 Rodenburg et al.},

abstract={Background: Nearly one in five 4-year-old children in the United States are obese, with low-income children almost twice as likely to be obese as their middle/upper-income peers. Few obesity prevention programs for low-income preschoolers and their parents have been rigorously tested, and effects are modest. We are testing a novel obesity prevention program for low-income preschoolers built on the premise that children who are better able to self-regulate in the face of psychosocial stressors may be less likely to eat impulsively in response to stress. Enhancing behavioral self-regulation skills in low-income children may be a unique and important intervention approach to prevent childhood obesity. Methods/design. The Growing Healthy study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating two obesity prevention interventions in 600 low-income preschoolers attending Head Start, a federally-funded preschool program for low-income children. Interventions are delivered by community-based, nutrition-education staff partnering with Head Start. The first intervention (n = 200), Preschool Obesity Prevention Series (POPS), addresses evidence-based obesity prevention behaviors for preschool-aged children and their parents. The second intervention (n = 200) comprises POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an evidence-based approach to improving self-regulation among preschool-aged children. The comparison condition (n = 200) is Usual Head Start Exposure. We hypothesize that POPS will yield positive effects compared to Usual Head Start, and that the combined intervention (POPS + IYS) addressing behaviors well-known to be associated with obesity risk, as well as self-regulatory capacity, will be most effective in preventing excessive increases in child adiposity indices (body mass index, skinfold thickness). We will evaluate additional child outcomes using parent and teacher reports and direct assessments of food-related self-regulation. We will also gather process data on intervention implementation, including fidelity, attendance, engagement, and satisfaction. Discussion. The Growing Healthy study will shed light on associations between self-regulation skills and obesity risk in low-income preschoolers. If the project is effective in preventing obesity, results can also provide critical insights into how best to deliver obesity prevention programming to parents and children in a community-based setting like Head Start in order to promote better health among at-risk children. © 2012 Miller et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Basic research in animals represents a fruitful approach to study the neurobiological basis of brain and behavioral disturbances relevant to neuropsychiatric disease and to establish and evaluate novel pharmacological therapies for their treatment. In the context of schizophrenia, there are models employing specific experimental manipulations developed according to specific pathophysiological or etiological hypotheses. The use of selective lesions in adult animals and the acute administration of psychotomimetic agents are indispensable tools in the elucidation of the contribution of specific brain regions or neurotransmitters to the genesis of a specific symptom or collection of symptoms and enjoy some degrees of predictive validity. However, they may be inaccurate, if not inadequate, in capturing the etiological mechanisms or ontology of the disease needed for a complete understanding of the disease and may be limited in the discovery of novel compounds for the treatment of negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Under the prevailing consensus of schizophrenia as a disease of neurodevelopmental origin, we have seen the establishment of neurodevelopmental animal models which aim to identify the etiological processes whereby the brain, following specific triggering events, develops into a schizophrenia-like brain over time. Many neurodevelopmental models such as the neonatal ventral hippocampus (vHPC) lesion, methylazoxymethanol (MAM), and prenatal immune activation models can mimic a broad spectrum of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacological abnormalities directly implicated in schizophrenic disease. These models allow pharmacological screens against multiple and coexisting schizophrenia-related dysfunctions while incorporating the disease-relevant concept of abnormal brain development. The multiplicity of existing models is testimonial to the multifactorial nature of schizophrenia, and there are ample opportunities for their integration. Indeed, one ultimate goal must be to incorporate the successes of distinct models into one unitary account of the complex disorder of schizophrenia and to use such unitary approaches in the further development and evaluation of novel antipsychotic treatment strategies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Abstract. Background: Maternal effects are environmental influences on the phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in its mother, and are expected to evolve whenever females are better capable of assessing the environmental conditions that their offspring will experience than the offspring themselves. In the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, conditional male dimorphism is associated with alternative reproductive tactics: majors fight and guard females whereas minors sneak copulations. Furthermore, variation in dung beetle population density has different fitness consequences for each male morph, and theory predicts that higher population density might select for a higher frequency of minors and/or greater expenditure on weaponry in majors. Because adult dung beetles provide offspring with all the nutritional resources for their development, maternal effects strongly influence male phenotype. Results: Here we tested whether female O. taurus are capable of perceiving population density, and responding by changing the phenotype of their offspring. We found that mothers who were reared with other conspecifics in their pre-mating period produced major offspring that had longer horns across a wider range of body sizes than the major offspring of females that were reared in isolation in their pre-mating period. Moreover, our results indicate that this maternal effect on male weaponry does not operate through the amount of dung provided by females to their offspring, but is rather transmitted through egg or brood mass composition. Finally, although theory predicts that females experiencing higher density might produce more minor males, we found no support for this, rather the best fitting models were equivocal as to whether fewer or the same proportions of minors were produced. Conclusions: Our study describes a new type of maternal effect in dung beetles, which probably allows females to respond to population density adaptively, preparing at least their major offspring for the sexual competition they will face in the future. This new type of maternal effect in dung beetles represents a novel transgenerational response of alternative reproductive tactics to population density. © 2012 Buzatto et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Behavioral analysis is a high-end read-out of aging impact on an organism, and here, we have analyzed behaviors in 4-, 22-, and 28-month-old male C57BL/6J with a broad range of tests. For comparison, a group of 28-month-old males maintained on dietary restriction (DR) was included. The most conspicuous alteration was the decline in exploration activity with advancing age. Aging also affected other behaviors such as motor skill acquisition and grip strength, in contrast to latency to thermal stimuli and visual placement which were unchanged. Object recognition tests revealed intact working memory at 28 months while memory recollection was impaired already at 22 months. Comparison with female C57BL/6J (Fahlström et al., Neurobiol Aging 32:1868-1880, 2011) revealed that alterations in aged males and females are similar and that several of the behavioral indices correlate with age in both sexes. Moreover, we examined if behavioral indices in 22-month-old males could predict remaining life span as suggested in the study by Ingram and Reynolds (Exp Aging Res 12(3):155-162, 1986) and found that exploratory activity and motor skills accounted for up to 65% of the variance. Consistent with that a high level of exploratory activity and preserved motor capacity indicated a long post-test survival, 28-month-old males maintained on DR were more successful in such tests than ad libitum fed age-matched males. In summary, aged C57BL/6J males are marked by a reduced exploratory activity, an alteration that DR impedes. In light of recently published data, we discuss if a diminishing drive to explore may associate with aging-related impairment of central aminergic pathways. © 2011 American Aging Association.},

abstract={Agonistic behavior may influence the dispersal of species and spatial distribution of individuals within a population. The Mediterranean gecko Hemidactylus turcicus was used to test 2 hypotheses: 1) adult behavior differs in responses to conspecifics and resource limitations; and 2) juvenile behavior is affected by visual, chemical, and tactile adult male cues. I quantified behavioral responses of males to different levels of food quality, availability of retreat sites, and the presence of a resident male. Aggression was significantly more prevalent in the presence of a conspecific male regardless of resource availability. To test the 2nd hypothesis, I observed juvenile responses to chemosensory cues of either a confined or non-confined adult male. Both visual and chemosensory cues combined, rather than chemical cues alone influenced juvenile responses. Juveniles also exhibited sensory behavior (tongue-flicking) upon entering a novel environment, indicating that chemical mediation may be sufficient to impact behavior. Results of these contests illustrate the importance of chemical communication in providing information which influences behavioral responses and suggests a role for self and mutual assessments during intraspecific encounters. The outcome of competitive encounters may heavily rely on information collected via chemical cues and may ultimately regulate aggression by informing individuals about whether or not to fight and thus adhere to the confines of social dominance within the species.},

abstract={Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia, bulimia nervosa belong to the behavioural and psychiatric disorders especially common in adolescents during the puberty period. The girls aged 14-18 years old constitute the risk group for anorexia nervosa with the tendency to affect even the younger girls. Eating disorders are characterized by body dissatisfaction related to the overvaluation of the thin body ideal associated with dysfunctional patterns of cognition and weight control behaviours that results in significant medical, psychological and social complication. The important factor for initiating the onset of eating disorders is dysfunctional family background: controlling and with high expectations and demands mother and the certain personality traits of the adolescent such as low esteem, high ambition, perfectionism, perseverance, determination. The first symptoms of anorexia nervosa are often unnoticeable. They began with gradual elimination of the chosen food products e.g. sweets, bread, meat and introduction of "healthy" or "fit" eating patterns to the daily diet routine. During the initial phase of the disease the food restriction plays the corroborant role giving the anorectic patient the feeling of full control, satisfaction and even sense of the success. Patient with bulimia nervosa are often undiagnosed because there is no spectacular and evident reduction of the body mass. The half of the patients with anorexia demonstrate the suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts. The majority of them shows the self-destructive behaviours. The treatment of eating disorders comprise the permanent and complex psychiatric therapy including the individual and family psychotherapy together with nutritional treatment. There is clear correlation between the duration of the disorder and the prognosis. The earlier diagnose is established, the better prognosis for the effective treatment is achieved.

abstract={Contemporary descriptions of human intelligence hold that this trait influences a broad range of cognitive abilities, including learning, attention, and reasoning. Like humans, individual genetically heterogeneous mice express a "general" cognitive trait that influences performance across a diverse array of learning and attentional tasks, and it has been suggested that this trait is qualitatively and structurally analogous to general intelligence in humans. However, the hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to use various forms of "reasoning" to support solutions to novel problems. Here, we find that genetically heterogeneous mice are capable of solving problems that are nominally indicative of inductive and deductive forms of reasoning, and that individuals' capacity for reasoning covaries with more general learning abilities. Mice were characterized for their general learning ability as determined by their aggregate performance (derived from principal component analysis) across a battery of five diverse learning tasks. These animals were then assessed on prototypic tests indicative of deductive reasoning (inferring the meaning of a novel item by exclusion, i.e., "fast mapping") and inductive reasoning (execution of an efficient search strategy in a binary decision tree). The animals exhibited systematic abilities on each of these nominal reasoning tasks that were predicted by their aggregate performance on the battery of learning tasks. These results suggest that the coregulation of reasoning and general learning performance in genetically heterogeneous mice form a core cognitive trait that is analogous to human intelligence. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={The spatial distribution of foraging animals at a given time simultaneously depends on (1) exogenous environmental variables such as resource availability and abiotic habitat characteristics, and (2) the endogenous variable social aggregation made up of the opposing mechanisms of conspecific attraction and repulsion. We developed an exogenous environment-social aggregation model to analyse the spatial distributions of six abundant shorebird species in the Dutch Wadden Sea at resolutions of 150×150, 200×200 and 250×250m. We used these resolutions to check the robustness of the estimates to the modifiable areal unit problem. We estimated the model parameters by spatial autoregression. This approach enables, among others, estimation of the direct and indirect effects of an exogenous environmental variable on animal density. The former is given by the regression coefficient and the latter, which is due to the amplification of the direct effect by social aggregation, by the spatial multiplier. At all resolution levels and for all species, the explanatory power of social aggregation, measured by Nagelkerke R2, was larger than the combined contribution of the exogenous environmental variables food availability, silt content and mudflat elevation. Social aggregation was stronger for dunlin, Calidris alpina, red knot, Calidris canutus, and curlew, Numenius arquata, than for oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, grey plover, Pluvialis squatarola, and bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica. The total impacts (that is, direct effect plus all indirect impacts) of the exogenous environmental predictors tended to exceed substantially the direct effects (which tend to be the only ones examined in studies on foraging distributions). © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Neotropical monkeys of the genera Cacajao, Chiropotes, and Pithecia (Pitheciidae) are considered to be highly arboreal, spending most of their time feeding and traveling in the upper canopy. Until now, the use of terrestrial substrates has not been analyzed in detail in this group. Here, we review the frequency of terrestrial use among pitheciin taxa to determine the ecological and social conditions that might lead to such behavior. We collated published and unpublished data from 14 taxa in the three genera. Data were gleaned from 53 published studies (including five on multiple pitheciin genera) and personal communications of unpublished data distributed across 31 localities. Terrestrial activity was reported in 61% of Pithecia field studies (11 of 18), in 34% of Chiropotes studies (10 of 29), and 36% of Cacajao studies (4 of 11). Within Pithecia, terrestrial behavior was more frequently reported in smaller species (e.g. P. pithecia) that are vertical clingers and leapers and make extensive use of the understory than in in the larger bodied canopy dwellers of the western Amazon (e.g. P. irrorata). Terrestrial behavior in Pithecia also occurred more frequently and lasted longer than in Cacajao or Chiropotes. An apparent association was found between flooded habitats and terrestrial activity and there is evidence of the development of a "local pattern" of terrestrial use in some populations. Seasonal fruit availability also may stimulate terrestrial behavior. Individuals also descended to the ground when visiting mineral licks, escaping predators, and responding to accidents such as a dropped infant. Overall, the results of this review emphasize that terrestrial use is rare among the pitheciins in general and is usually associated with the exploitation of specific resources or habitat types. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Environmental differences among populations are expected to lead to local adaptation, while spatial or temporal environmental variation within a population will favour evolution of phenotypic plasticity. As plasticity itself can be under selection, locally adapted populations can vary in levels of plasticity. Nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) originating from isolated ponds (low piscine predation risk, high competition) vs. lake and marine populations (high piscine predation risk, low competition) are known to be morphologically adapted to their respective environments. However, nothing is known about their ability to express phenotypic plasticity in morphology in response to perceived predation risk or food availability/competition. We studied predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in body shape and armour of marine and pond nine-spined stickleback in a factorial common garden experiment with two predator treatments (present vs. absent) and two feeding regimes (low vs. high). The predation treatment did not induce any morphological shifts in fish from either habitat or food regime. However, strong habitat-dependent differences between populations as well as strong sexual dimorphism in both body shape and armour were found. The lack of predator-induced plasticity in development of the defence traits (viz. body armour and body depth) suggests that morphological anti-predator traits in nine-spined stickleback are strictly constitutive, rather than inducible. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={This chapter focuses on understanding how the hypothalamic "behavior control column" integrates the three basic classes of motivated behavior required for the survival of all animals. The hypothalamus is responsible for integrating various endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses that guarantee the survival of both the individual and the species. These responses are involved in regulating metabolism, providing an adequate supply of nutrients and water from the environment, allowing for the generation and care of offspring, and defending the animal from predators and other threats. Before reviewing the structural organization of the hypothalamus, it is important to consider the evidence supporting the idea that this part of the brain controls the three basic classes of behavior required for the survival of all animals: ingestive, defensive, and reproductive. Chronic midbrain animals display no spontaneous locomotor behavior when they are left undisturbed, cannot reproduce, and do not show spontaneous integrated defensive behaviors. These animals are generally aphagic and adipsic, but still can chew and swallow if food or water is placed in their mouth. Moreover, midbrain animals still reject unpalatable food and show responses involving short-term comparisons of gustatory stimuli, but they fail to generate compensatory responses to challenges requiring longer term processing. In contrast, hypothalamic animals can regulate their body weight and body water by ingesting appropriate amounts of food and water, if they are readily available, can reproduce, and can display complete defensive responses, even to normally innocuous stimuli. Therefore, this evidence suggests that controllers for ingestive, reproductive, and defensive behaviors are found in the hypothalamus. Distinct nuclei in the hypothalamus respond to certain aspects of the internal environment and to certain types of external stimuli. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: There are few weight gain prevention interventions aimed at new immigrants. Live Well, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) study, was designed to address this gap. Objective: The goal of this paper is to describe the development of the Live Well nutrition and physical activity curriculum. Methods: The curriculum draws on behavioral theory and popular education and was co-created, implemented, and will be evaluated by community partners and academic researchers. Results: The time it took to develop the curriculum exceeded initial estimates. However, the extra time taken was spent engaging in needed dialogue to create a better product, fully co-created by academic and community partners. Additionally, working with an outside expert created the opportunity for all partners to train together, build capacity, and increase cohesion. Our approach developed relationships and trust, and resulted in a unique curriculum. Conclusions: The commitment to partnership resulted in a curriculum to empower immigrant women to improve health decisions and behaviors. This will inform future research and programming targeting other at-risk and new immigrant communities. © 2012 The Johns Hopkins University Press.},

abstract={N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) cannot be synthesized de novo in mammals and need to be provided by dietary means. In the brain, the main n-3 PUFA is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is a key component of neuronal membranes. A low dietary level of DHA has been associated with increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric diseases; however, the mechanisms involved remain to be determined. In this study, we found that long-term exposure to an n-3 deficient diet decreases the level of DHA in the brain and impairs the cannabinoid receptor signaling pathway in mood-controlling structures. In n-3 deficient mice, the effect of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 in an anxiety-like behavior test was abolished. In addition, the cannabinoid receptor signaling pathways were altered in the prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus. Consequently, our data suggest that behavioral changes linked to an n-3 dietary deficiency are due to an alteration in the endocannabinoid system in specific brain areas. © University of Navarra 2012.},

abstract={Social learning, whereby animals learn from others, mediates the spread of information through social networks. To make this process adaptive, animals should be selective with respect to when and whom to copy. The cost of decision making can be curbed by cognitive biases favouring particular categories of individuals. Such model biases are well documented, but few, if any, experimental studies have addressed potential developmental causes of this variation. We therefore tested whether and how the postnatal environment affected social-learning preferences in a known social learner the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Birds from experimentally manipulated brood sizes, a treatment known to affect adult phenotypic quality in this species, were tested in an established observer-demonstrator paradigm. Naïve observers could watch unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics feed from differently coloured novel feeders. When subsequently allowed to choose between identical feeders, postnatal conditions (=rearing brood size) had strong effects on who copied whom in adulthood: males preferred the feeders of demonstrators from large brood sizes, females those of demonstrators from brood sizes matching their own, suggesting stratified information transfer within foraging groups. Our results demonstrate how individuals' developmental history can explain substantial interindividual variation in model biases and ensuing structured information transfer within groups. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) is an effective treatment for morbid obesity. Increased alcohol abuse after RYGB resulted in recommendations to exclude patients with alcohol abuse histories from RYGB. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of a RYGB on ethanol intake in diet-induced obese rats (high-fat diet). Methods: The animals underwent RYGB and were habituated along with their sham-operated obese controls and with lean rats to increasing concentrations of ethanol in a two-bottle choice paradigm. Results: RYGB rats' daily consumption of ethanol averaged 2 g/kg at 2 % habituation and 3.8 g/kg at 4 % habituation, twice as much as sham-operated obese controls and 50 % more than normal-diet lean controls. Obese controls drank on average 1 g/kg of ethanol (2 and 4 %), significantly less (50 %) than lean controls did. RYGB rats when given higher ethanol concentrations (6 and 8 %) or no ethanol drank significantly more water than lean and obese controls did (66 and 100 %, respectively), and their enhanced total fluid intake was associated with increased food intake, which was significantly higher than in lean (66 % more calories; food + alcohol) and obese controls (44 % more calories). The lower alcohol intake in the obese controls than in the lean rats suggests that obesity may interfere with alcohol's rewarding effects and RYGB may remove this protective effect. Conclusions: The overall enhancement of consummatory behaviors (both ethanol and water) suggests that RYGB may facilitate alcohol consumption, which in vulnerable individuals could lead to abuse and addiction. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).},

abstract={Tryptophan is the precursor for several neurotransmitters and metabolic regulators, which, although quantitatively of little importance in determining the dietary requirement, have major importance for interpreting symptoms of dietary tryptophan deficiency and excess. The quantitative dietary tryptophan requirement appears to vary widely across species, so intakes relative to requirementsare more appropriate expressions for comparison of adverse effects across species than daily intakeor diet concentration. Symptoms of tryptophan deficiency may occur at intakes as little as 25% below the requirement. Symptoms include reduced feed intake and reduced growth rate but also impaired skeletal development and aberrant behavior. Older animals appear less susceptible than younger animals to tryptophan deficiency and females less than males. Symptoms of excess tryptophan intake include reduced food intake and growth rate. In growing animals, it appears that tryptophan intakes of > 10 times the requirement are necessary before there are detrimental effects on growth performance. At still greater intakes, fatty liver and fibrotic changes in muscles, lung, and pancreas and the serotonin syndrome may develop. In pigs, tryptophan intake of 60 times the daily requirement did notcause mortality. The maximal tryptophan oxidation rate, measured in vivo using 13Cuniversally labeled tryptophan, may be a possible marker of the intake above which increasing intake increases the risk of adverse effects. The advantage of the oxidation technique is that it does not necessarily rely on but still allows the identification and measurement of amino acid metabolites and is therefore simpler and more universally applicable. © 2012 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common worldwide and cause considerable social and economic burden. The aims of SEPAHAN project were to 1) assess the prevalence of different FGIDs within an Iranian population, 2) investigate the relationship of FGIDs and their symptoms with lifestyle and nutritional factors, and 3) investigate the relationship of FGIDs and their symptoms with psychological factors. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study among staff of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Health Sciences (Isfahan, Iran) and consisted of two main phases. In the first phase, a detailed dietary questionnaire was used to assess dietary habits and usual dietary intakes. Other lifestyle factors were investigated using appropriate questionnaires. In the second phase, the epidemiology of different FGIDs was determined using Rome III criteria. In addition, different psychological assessment tools were used to screen for anxiety, depression, psychological distress, coping styles, stressful life events, personality trait, and level of social support. Self-administered questionnaires were used in this study. RESULTS: In the first and second phases of the study, 8691 and 6239 adults were recruited, respectively. The complete information of 4763 subjects has been provided after linking the questionnaires from both phases. CONCLUSIONS: SEPAHAN project is a novel study that provides the opportunity of investigating epidemiological aspects of FGIDs and their relationship with different lifestyle and psychological factors.},

abstract={The concept of epigenetics refers nowadays to the long-lasting and inheritable gene expression states that are established in the absence of a change in the DNA sequence itself. The fast progress of the field in later times has provided scientists with novel understanding on how the environment in the wide sense, including nutrition, exercise, even behavior of the organisms, participates in the regulation of gene expression. The molecular mechanisms that mediate epigenetic regulation are principally DNA methylation, the post-translational modifications of the histones and the regulation by non-coding RNAs. They are intimately related to cell differentiation and developmental plasticity and relay environmental influences to the cell nucleus, thus bridging the gap between lifestyle and the genome. In this introductory chapter we offer a general vision of the well-documented effects of lifestyle choices and environmental impact on gene expression and present the reader with a general overview of the better known epigenetic mechanisms and the techniques most often used to study them. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

abstract={Objective: To assess the safety of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4) in females following routine administration. Design: In a cohort of vaccinated females, we compared the risk of emergency department visits and hospitalizations during the interval soon after vaccination with risk during a comparison interval more remote from vaccination. Setting: Kaiser Permanente in California. Participants: All females who received the HPV4 vaccine. Main Exposure: One or more doses of HPV4 between August 2006 and March 2008. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes were emergency department visits and hospitalizations, grouped into predefined diagnostic categories. Within diagnostic groups, we used odds ratios (ORs) to estimate whether each subject had any outcome in postvaccination risk intervals (days 1-60, days 1-14, and day 0), compared with a control interval distant in time from vaccination. Results: One hundred eighty-nine thousand six hundred twenty-nine females received at least 1 dose and 44 001 received 3 HPV4 doses. Fifty categories had significantly elevated ORs during at least 1 risk interval. Medical record review revealed that most diagnoses were present before vaccination or diagnostic workups were initiated at the vaccine visit. Only skin infections during days 1 to 14 (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4) and syncope on day of vaccination (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.9-9.2) were noted by an independent Safety Review Committee as likely associations with HPV4. Conclusions: The quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine was associated with same-day syncope and skin infections in the 2 weeks after vaccination. This study did not detect evidence of new safety concerns among females 9 to 26 years of age secondary to vaccination with HPV4. ©2012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Animal studies are very useful in detection of early disease indicators and in unravelling the pathophysiological processes underlying core psychiatric disorder phenotypes. Early indicators are critical for preventive and efficient treatment of progressive psychiatric disorders like anorexia nervosa. Comparable to physical hyperactivity observed in anorexia nervosa patients, in the activity-based anorexia rodent model, mice and rats express paradoxical high voluntary wheel running activity levels when food restricted. Eleven inbred mouse strains and outbred Wistar WU rats were exposed to the activity-based anorexia model in search of identifying susceptibility predictors. Body weight, food intake and wheel running activity levels of each individual mouse and rat were measured. Mouse strains and rats with high wheel running activity levels during food restriction exhibited accelerated body weight loss. Linear mixed models for repeated measures analysis showed that baseline wheel running activity levels preceding the scheduled food restriction phase strongly predicted activity-based anorexia susceptibility (mice: Beta = -0.0158 (±0.003 SE), P<0.0001; rats: Beta = -0.0242 (±0.004 SE), P<0.0001) compared to other baseline parameters. These results suggest that physical activity levels play an important role in activity-based anorexia susceptibility in different rodent species with genetically diverse background. These findings support previous retrospective studies on physical activity levels in anorexia nervosa patients and indicate that pre-morbid physical activity levels could reflect an early indicator for disease severity. © 2012 Pjetri et al.},

abstract={The dorsolateral column of the periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) integrates aversive emotional experiences and represents an important site responding to life threatening situations, such as hypoxia, cardiac pain and predator threats. Previous studies have shown that the dorsal PAG also supports fear learning; and we have currently explored how the dlPAG influences associative learning. We have first shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 100 pmol injection in the dlPAG works as a valuable unconditioned stimulus (US) for the acquisition of olfactory fear conditioning (OFC) using amyl acetate odor as conditioned stimulus (CS). Next, we revisited the ascending projections of the dlPAG to the thalamus and hypothalamus to reveal potential paths that could mediate associative learning during OFC. Accordingly, the most important ascending target of the dlPAG is the hypothalamic defensive circuit, and we were able to show that pharmacological inactivation using β-adrenoceptor blockade of the dorsal premammillary nucleus, the main exit way for the hypothalamic defensive circuit to thalamo-cortical circuits involved in fear learning, impaired the acquisition of the OFC promoted by NMDA stimulation of the dlPAG. Moreover, our tracing study revealed multiple parallel paths from the dlPAG to several thalamic targets linked to cortical-hippocampal-amygdalar circuits involved in fear learning. Overall, the results point to a major role of the dlPAG in the mediation of aversive associative learning via ascending projections to the medial hypothalamic defensive circuit, and perhaps, to other thalamic targets, as well. These results provide interesting perspectives to understand how life threatening events impact on fear learning, and should be useful to understand pathological fear memory encoding in anxiety disorders. © 2012 Kincheski et al.},

abstract={Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) may provide the scientific basis for personalized and systems medicine. The exploration of the extensive interactions among psychological and behavioral factors, the nervous system, the immune system, and the endocrine system may help understand the mechanisms underlying health, wellness, and diseases. PNI theories based on systems biology methodologies may contribute to the identification of patient patterns for establishing psychological and physiological profiles for personalized medicine. A biopsychosocial model will help elucidate the systemic interrelationships between psychosocial and bio-physiological factors for the development of systems medicine. Many evidences have supported the close relationships between stress, depression, inflammation, and disorders including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, skin diseases, infectious diseases, and sleep disorders. As inflammation is a critical connection among different diseases, the elucidation of the associations may contribute to the findings of systemic therapeutic targets. With the understanding of the translational implications of PNI, integrative interventions in multiple dimensions can be applied to modulate stress responses and promote healthier behaviors. These interventions include combination drug therapies, diets, nutritional supplements, meditation, and other behavioral and mind-body strategies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Animals live in complex environments in which predation risk and food availability change over time. To deal with this variability and maximize their survival, animals should take into account how long current conditions may persist and the possible future conditions they may encounter. This should affect their foraging activity, and with it their vulnerability to predation across periods of good and bad conditions. Here we develop a comprehensive theory of optimal risk allocation that allows for environmental persistence and for fluctuations in food availability as well as predation risk. We show that it is the duration of good and bad periods, independent of each other, rather than the overall proportion of time exposed to each that is the most important factor affecting behavior. Risk allocation is most pronounced when conditions change frequently, and optimal foraging activity can either increase or decrease with increasing exposure to bad conditions. When food availability fluctuates rapidly, animals should forage more when food is abundant, whereas when food availability fluctuates slowly, they should forage more when food is scarce. We also show that survival can increase as variability in predation risk increases. Our work reveals that environmental persistence should profoundly influence behavior. Empirical studies of risk allocation should therefore carefully control the duration of both good and bad periods and consider manipulating food availability as well as predation risk. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={1.In seasonal environments, optimal onset of breeding and survival plays major roles in individual fitness. Many physiological and behavioural factors related to breeding increase the risk of predation; thus, breeding decisions should be based on current risks and benefits. According to life-history theory, if current predation risk is high and breeding itself increases the risk, it may be beneficial to postpone breeding. 2.During winter in northern hemispheres, food availability is limited and is at its lowest just prior to the onset of breeding in spring. Food constraint may lead to poor condition and reduced ability to start breeding. 3.We studied the effects of food and predation risk on winter survival and onset of breeding in a common boreal rodent, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). In a 2×2 factorial experiment, we manipulated food availability (food supplemented or not) and predation risk (presence/absence of predator odour) in 20 large outdoor enclosures in central Finland. 4.Survival probabilities were highest in no predation risk treatments, whereas they were lowest in the predator risk treatment. The same trend was observed in vole densities and the weight change in individuals. Voles with food addition bred earlier than in the other treatments. 5.We conclude that during energy constrained harsh conditions in winter, predation risk causes behavioural changes throughout the winter and has significant negative survival and fitness effects for small mammals, reflected as delay in the start of breeding. © 2012 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Possible links between lower birth weight, childhood diet, and learning in Taiwan are evaluated. The population representative Elementary School Children's Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan 2001-2002 and the national birth registry were used to examine school and social performance using the modified Scale for Assessing Emotional Disturbance questionnaires in relation to diet quality by the Youth Healthy Eating Index-Taiwan and birth weight of children aged 6-13 years (n=2283). Lower birth weight (≤15th percentile: ≤2850. g for boys and ≤2700. g for girls) children were mostly from mountainous areas and of indigenous descent. Compared to normal birth weight, lower birth weight girls experienced greater inability to learn and weaker overall competence. Better diet quality predicted more favorable emotional and behavioral outcomes in lower birth weight girls, and this persisted with adjustment for covariates. None of these findings were evident among boys. Girls' cognitive and social development appears to be susceptible to diet quality and birth weight, such that the adverse risk of lower birth weight on school performance may be offset by improved diet. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Reversible changes in how readily animals fight can be explained in terms of adaptive responses to differences in the costs and benefits of fighting. In contrast, long-term differences in aggressiveness raise a number of questions, including why animals are consistent with respect to this trait, why aggressiveness is often linked to general risk taking, and why aggressive and nonaggressive animals often coexist within a population. In fish, different levels of aggressiveness bring several direct fitness-related consequences, such as when aggressive individuals monopolize a limited food supply and grow fast. They also bring indirect consequences, such as when aggressive fish are more susceptible to predation and when they require a larger respiratory surface to service a higher metabolic rate. Fitness consequences of aggressiveness are often context dependent, with aggressive fish tending to do well in simple, predictable conditions but not in complex, less predictable conditions. The diverse, context-dependent consequences of aggression mean that aggressive and nonaggressive fish flourish in different conditions and explain in general terms why these behavioral phe-notypes often coexist. There are a number of candidate evolutionary frameworks for explaining why individual differences in aggressiveness are often, but not always, consistent over time and often, but not always, linked to differences in general risk taking. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Individual variation in natal dispersal behaviors has extensive ecological and evolutionary consequences. Traits such as offspring sex, age, and body condition may influence dispersal, resulting in a potentially complex suite of associations in traits that can affect fitness. Conceivably, individuals with particular phenotypes may breed in different habitats, thus potentiating the development of geographic variation. Moreover, studies typically underestimate dispersal distance owing to sampling issues and rarely consider the direction of movement, limiting understanding of this important life history stage. I examined the influence of phenotypic and social traits on dispersal distance and direction in a family living bird, the western slaty antshrike (Thamnophilus atrinucha). When accounting for detection probability, juveniles dispersed 1-14 territories and 46-1268 m. The age at dispersal and body mass upon leaving the nest influenced dispersal distance and direction. Older and heavier individuals dispersed shorter distances. Younger individuals dispersed towards comparatively younger forest with a higher density of antshrike territories. Older and heavier offspring may be more competitive and/or have increased experience with the local habitat, increasing their probability of acquiring nearby territories. Contrary to other studies, sex-biased dispersal distance was not observed. Instead, the sexes dispersed in different directions, potentially to reduce the risk of inbreeding. This study revealed the importance of age at dispersal and body mass on variation in dispersal behaviors and highlighted the need to investigate sex biases in dispersal direction. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between individuals of different personality types. We tested whether individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment, we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites. During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk. Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using optimality approaches. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Background: The aim of the study was to investigate whether patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) could be subdivided into clinically meaningful groups reflecting the complex patterns of eating disorder symptoms and personality characteristics that face the clinician. Methods: Seventy patients diagnosed with BN using the Eating Disorder Examination were assessed with measures of negative affect, attachment patterns, and interpersonal problems. An exploratory hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. Results: The study found two main subtypes differing primarily in terms of symptom severity and level of negative affect, but these subtypes were further subdivided into four clinically relevant subtypes: A dietary restraint/negative affect/high symptomatic group, an emotionally overcontrolled group, a low dietary restraint/emotionally underregulated group, and a high functioning/securely attached group. Conclusions: The study indicates that cluster-analytic studies, including a broad range of instruments measuring eating disorder symptoms as well as negative affect, relational patterns, and other personality characteristics, may contribute to an integration of previously suggested models of subtypes in BN. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Decision making is vital to the fitness of all animals, with many social species making consensus decisions that require efficient communication. Chemical signals are the most important tools for many animals, and are used notably by social insects in a wide variety of contexts, from foraging for food to recognition of nestmates. However, chemical cues may be biosynthetically limited and costly to produce, making their use in multiple contexts potentially beneficial. In this study we examined the role of foraging pheromones during nest migrations in the Pharaoh's ant, Monomorium pharaonis. Using a Y-shaped bridge apparatus, we tested whether ants would prefer migrating to a novel nest site along branches coated with attractive foraging pheromones rather than to a nest site reached via a control branch. We found that ants preferred to migrate to nest sites reached via branches with attractive foraging pheromones, and that there were more queens and workers in those nests at the end of the migration than in nests at the end of control branches. The results show that attractive foraging pheromones are utilized during nest migrations in the Pharaoh's ant, highlighting the evolutionary pressure to use signals in a parsimonious manner to improve communication during decision making. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Taxonomic investigations of the Delias mysis (Fabricius, 1775) complex from northern Australia indicate two additional species in the Australian fauna: Delias aestiva Butler, 1897 stat. rev. and Delias lara (Boisduval, 1836). The latter species, which is illustrated from Australia for the first time, was until recently known under the name Delias mysis onca Fruhstorfer, 1910. Evidence from adult morphology (male genitalia), colour pattern of the adult and immature stages, behaviour, and ecology indicates substantial phenotypic divergence between D.aestiva and D.mysis. Within Australian limits, all three taxa are allopatric: D aestiva is endemic to the Top End, Northen Territory, D.mysis mysis is restricted to northern and north-eastern Queensland, whereas Deliaslara lara is known only from three specimens from the Torres Strait islands, Queensland. Delias aestiva is perhaps the most remarkable member of the complex and indeed the genus, breeding in tropical mangrove habitats in coastal estuarine areas where the larvae specialize on mature foliage of the tree Excoecaria ovalis Endl. (Euphorbiaceae). This host preference is novel given the general tendency of Delias to feed on hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales (Loranthaceae, Santalaceae and Viscaceae). Under laboratory conditions, however, larvae successfully completed development on the mistletoe genera Amyema, Dendrophthoe and Decaisnina (all Loranthaceae) with no significant reduction in larval survival. These findings, together with phylogenetic hypotheses of the Aporiina and Delias, indicate a recent evolutionary host shift from Loranthaceae to Euphorbiaceae. The foliage of Excoecaria produces toxic latex, which is composed of a variety of secondary plant compounds, including diterpenoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids and phorbol esters. The mechanism of detoxification has not been established, although the larvae of D.aestiva are gregarious, regurgitate fluid as part of their chemical defence, and the adults are highly aposematic. Adults are seasonal, being chiefly on the wing during the cooler dry season; during the wet season, the larval food plant is seasonally deciduous and it is suspected that the butterfly undergoes pupal diapause. The cryptically coloured green pupa and tendency to pupate singly in concealed situations of D.aestiva are highly unusual traits among Delias and are hypothesized to be adaptive responses associated with pupal diapause during the wet season. The unique habitat association, novel food plant specialization, and restricted distribution of D.aestiva emphasizess the biogeographical peculiarities of northern Australia, especially patterns of historical (vicariant) differentiation between the Top End and Cape York Peninsula within the Australian Monsoon Tropics. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Objective: To investigate whether temperament in 1.5 year olds predicts their consumption of potentially obesogenic foods and drinks at 3 and 7 years of age. Methods: Participants were 6997 mothers and infants from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Questionnaires were collected during pregnancy, at birth, and at 6 months and 1.5, 3, and 7 years of age. Predictor variables included children's temperament at 1.5 years of age (internalizing, externalizing, surgent) and mothers' negative affectivity. Outcome variables included children's consumption of sweet foods, sweet drinks, and fruits/vegetables at 3 and 7 years of age (dichotomized at the 85th percentile). Results: Controlling for covariates, internalizing 1.5 year olds (anxious, dependent) were 77% and 63% more likely to consume sweet drinks daily at 3 and 7 years of age, respectively; they were 55% and 43% more likely to consume sweet foods daily at 3 and 7 years, respectively. Externalizing 1.5 year olds (hyperactive, aggressive) were 34% more likely to consume sweet drinks daily at 7 years of age; they were 39% and 44% more likely to consume sweet foods daily at 3 and 7 years, respectively, and they were 47% and 33% less likely to consume fruits/vegetables daily at 3 and 7 years of age, respectively. Surgent 1.5 year olds (active, sociable) were 197% and 78% more likely to consume 2 portions of fruits/vegetables daily at 3 and 7 years, respectively. The association of maternal negative affectivity was limited to the child's consumption of sweet foods at 3 and 7 years. Conclusion: Early child temperament is a risk factor for obesogenic diet in later childhood. Mechanisms explaining this association need to be explored. © 2012 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

abstract={Dropping off is considered an anti-predator behavior for aphids since previous studies have shown that it reduces the risk of predation. However, little attention is paid to dropping behavior triggered by other external stresses such as daytime high temperatures which are predicted to become more frequent in the context of climate warming. Here we defined a new parameter, drop-off temperature (DOT), to describe the critical temperature at which an aphid drops off its host plant when the ambient temperature increases gradually and slowly. Detailed studies were conducted to reveal effects of short-term acclimation (temperature, exposure time at high-temperature and starvation) on DOT of an aphid species, Sitobion avenae. Our objectives were to test if the aphids dropped off host plant to avoid high temperatures and how short-term acclimation affected the aphids' dropping behavior in response to heat stress. We suggest that dropping is a behavioral thermoregulation to avoid heat stress, since aphids started to move before they dropped off and the dropped aphids were still able to control their muscles prior to knockdown. The adults starved for 12 h had higher DOT values than those that were unstarved or starved for 6 h, and there was a trade-off between behavioral thermoregulation and energy acquisition. Higher temperatures and longer exposure times at high temperatures significantly lowered the aphids' DOT, suggested that the aphids avoid heat stress by dropping when exposed to high temperatures. Climate warming may therefore increase the aphids' dropping probabilities and consequently affect the aphids' individual development and population growth. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Mercury in the Arctic is an important environmental and human health issue. The reliance of Northern Peoples on traditional foods, such as marine mammals, for subsistence means that they are particularly at risk from mercury exposure. The cycling of mercury in Arctic marine systems is reviewed here, with emphasis placed on the key sources, pathways and processes which regulate mercury levels in marine food webs and ultimately the exposure of human populations to this contaminant. While many knowledge gaps exist limiting our ability to make strong conclusions, it appears that the long-range transport of mercury from Asian emissions is an important source of atmospheric Hg to the Arctic and that mercury methylation resulting in monomethylmercury production (an organic form of mercury which is both toxic and bioaccumulated) in Arctic marine waters is the principal source of mercury incorporated into food webs. Mercury concentrations in biological organisms have increased since the onset of the industrial age and are controlled by a combination of abiotic factors (e.g., monomethylmercury supply), food web dynamics and structure, and animal behavior (e.g., habitat selection and feeding behavior). Finally, although some Northern Peoples have high mercury concentrations of mercury in their blood and hair, harvesting and consuming traditional foods have many nutritional, social, cultural and physical health benefits which must be considered in risk management and communication. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Myxobacteria exhibit complex social traits during which large populations of cells coordinate their behaviors. An iconic example is their response to starvation: thousands of cells move by gliding motility to build a fruiting body in which vegetative cells differentiate into spores. Here we review mechanisms that the model species Myxococcus xanthus uses for cell-cell interactions, with a focus on developmental signaling and social gliding motility. We also discuss a newly discovered cell-cell interaction whereby myxobacteria exchange their outer membrane (OM) proteins and lipids. The mechanism of OM transfer requires physical contact between aligned cells on a hard surface and is apparently mediated by OM fusion. The TraA and TraB proteins are required in both donor and recipient cells for transfer, suggesting bidirectional exchange, and TraA is thought to serve as a cell surface adhesin. OM exchange results in phenotypic changes that can alter gliding motility and development and is proposed to represent a novel microbial interacting platform to coordinate multicellular activities. © 2012.},

While the mechanisms underlying these observations remain unresolved, the DOHaD model assumes a developmental plasticity that allows adaptive regulation of the embryonic, fetal, and/or early postnatal metabolism in response to nutritional and environmental perturbations. Establishment of the epigenome coincides with vulnerable phases in development and provides one potential mechanism for long-lasting responses to transient environmental stimuli. Future studies in epigenetic epidemiology will seek to understand the role of various epigenetic mechanisms in DOHaD. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Behavioral flexibility that requires behavioral inhibition has important fitness consequences. One task commonly used to assess behavioral inhibition is the reverse-reward task in which the subject is rewarded by the non selected items. Lemurs were tested for their ability to solve the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task with the choice between identical quantities of different food items instead of different quantities of the same food. Two of four subjects mastered the task without a correction procedure and were able to generalize the acquired rule to novel combinations of food. One of the two subjects competent on the quality version of the task could transfer this ability to different quantities of the same food. Our results are compared to lemurs' performances when tested under the quantitative version in a previous study and those of capuchin monkeys tested under a similar paradigm. The whole results suggest that the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task may be easier to master than its quantitative counterpart and that lemurs perform better than capuchin monkeys as they were able to later transfer the learning rule to the quantitative version of the task. © 2012 Glady et al.},

abstract={Early life adversity has known impacts on adult health and behavior, yet little is known about the gene-environment interactions (GEIs) that underlie these consequences. We used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to show that chronic early nutritional adversity interacts with rover and sitter allelic variants of foraging (for) to affect adult exploratory behavior, a phenotype that is critical for foraging, and reproductive fitness. Chronic nutritional adversity during adulthood did not affect rover or sitter adult exploratory behavior; however, early nutritional adversity in the larval period increased sitter but not rover adult exploratory behavior. Increasing for gene expression in the mushroom bodies, an important center of integration in the fly brain, changed the amount of exploratory behavior exhibited by sitter adults when they did not experience early nutritional adversity but had no effect in sitters that experienced early nutritional adversity. Manipulation of the larval nutritional environment also affected adult reproductive output of sitters but not rovers, indicating GEIs on fitness itself. The natural for variants are an excellent model to examine how GEIs underlie the biological embedding of early experience.},

abstract={Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs has created a human health concern for anglers who consume fish. Variability in sport fish Hg concentration adds to the uncertainty of the amount of fish an angler can safely consume, so predicting where variability arises is useful. We evaluated the relative influence of diet (prey Hg concentration and energy density) and sex on sport fish Hg concentrations using a bioenergetics approach. Our results indicated that sport fish diets (prey Hg concentration followed by energy density) were the most important factors for determining sport fish Hg concentration followed by sex. Although physiological and behavioral differences based on sex may lead to differences in gross growth efficiency, resulting in different Hg concentrations in male and female sport fish, evaluating the relative importance of these differences will require sex-specific parameterization of bioenergetics models. Our results support previous findings that knowledge of sport fish diets (prey Hg concentration followed by energy density) and sex could aid in the prediction of sport fish Hg concentrations. Thus, basic knowledge of system-specific food web structure could provide valuable information for developing sport fish consumption advisories to better protect anglers and their families from Hg contamination. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={High-fat diet is a major causative factor of overweight and obesity, which are associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as anxiety and depression. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of bamboo extract (BEX) on anxiety-and depression-like neurobehaviours in mice treated with a high-fat diet. Male mice with CD-1 genetic background were treated for 2 months with either a standard or a high-fat diet (10 or 45 % energy from fat, respectively), with or without the BEX supplement (11 g dry mass per 17 MJ). The anxiety levels of mice were evaluated using open-field and hole-board tests, and depression was measured using the force-swimming test. The anxiety responses of the animals were found significantly increased after the high-fat diet treatment, and this elevation was effectively abolished by the BEX supplement. The high-fat diet seemed to have an anti-depressive effect in mice at the tested time point, but the effect of the BEX supplement on the depression level of the animals was not conclusive. The high-fat diet significantly decreased total glutathione content in the blood while the BEX supplement increased glutathione oxidation. In summary, the present study shows that decreased total glutathione concentration in the blood co-occurred with a high-fat treatment, high anxiety level and low depression level in mice, and when supplemented in a high-fat diet, BEX had an anxiolytic effect in mice. © The Authors 2012.},

abstract={The Drosophila melanogaster gustatory system consists of several neuronal pathways representing diverse taste modalities. The two predominant modalities are a sweet-sensing pathway that mediates attraction, and a bitter-sensing pathway that mediates avoidance. A central question is how flies integrate stimuli from these pathways and generate the appropriate behavioral response. We have developed a novel assay for induction of taste memories. We demonstrate that the gustatory response to fructose is suppressed when followed by the presence of bitter quinine. We employ optogenetic neural activation using infrared laser in combination with heat-sensitive channel - TRPA1 to precisely activate gustatory neurons. This optogenetic system allows for spatially and temporally controlled activation of distinct neural classes in the gustatory circuit. We directly activated bitter-sensing neurons together with presentation of fructose for remote induction of aversive taste memories. Here we report that activation of bitter-sensing neurons in the proboscis suffices as a conditioning stimulus. Spatially restricted stimulation indicates that the conditioning stimulus is indeed a signal from the bitter neurons in the proboscis and it is independent of postingestive feedback. The coincidence of temporally specific activation of bitter-sensing neurons with fructose presentation is crucial for memory formation, establishing aversive taste learning in Drosophila as associative learning. Taken together, this optogenetic system provides a powerful new tool for interrogation of the central brain circuits that mediate memory formation. © 2012 IBRO.},

abstract={Exclusive paternal care is the rarest form of parental investment in nature and theory predicts that the maintenance of this behavior depends on the balance between costs and benefits to males. Our goal was to assess costs of paternal care in the harvestman Iporangaia pustulosa, for which the benefits of this behavior in terms of egg survival have already been demonstrated. We evaluated energetic costs and mortality risks associated to paternal egg-guarding in the field. We quantified foraging activity of males and estimated how their body condition is influenced by the duration of the caring period. Additionally, we conducted a one-year capture-mark-recapture study and estimated apparent survival probabilities of caring and non-caring males to assess potential survival costs of paternal care. Our results indicate that caring males forage less frequently than non-caring individuals (males and females) and that their body condition deteriorates over the course of the caring period. Thus, males willing to guard eggs may provide to females a fitness-enhancing gift of cost-free care of their offspring. Caring males, however, did not show lower survival probabilities when compared to both non-caring males and females. Reduction in mortality risks as a result of remaining stationary, combined with the benefits of improving egg survival, may have played an important and previously unsuspected role favoring the evolution of paternal care. Moreover, males exhibiting paternal care could also provide an honest signal of their quality as offspring defenders, and thus female preference for caring males could be responsible for maintaining the trait. © 2012 Requena et al.},

abstract={In view of the importance of the nursing process in evidence-based practice, we attempt to identify validated and reliable instruments to collect data from patients. An integrative review was carried out in the databases CINAHL, BVS and PUBMED, using the words "nursing" and "validated clinical assessment tools", as well as "validation studies", "reproducibility of results" and "nursing assessment". Full articles available in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included, excluding reviews that did not follow the methodological steps described and did not address the theme. In the 40 analyzed studies, instruments were identified that are applicable to different areas, such as geriatrics and gerontology, intensive care, oncology, psychiatry, nutrition, infectology, occupational health, palliative care, cardiology, among others. Instruments were found to evaluate the following areas: risk of falls, patient satisfaction, quality of life, sleep, depression, mental confusion, dementia, pain,behavior, nutritional status, violence, personality, psychosis, breastfeeding, nausea and vomit, fatigue, end of life needs, sedation and agitation, abstinence from opioid use, pressure ulcers, capacity of workers with musculoskeletal problems to restart activities, immunological status of patients with HIV/AIDS, and patients' degree of knowledge about their disease. There was an increase in the number of publications from 1990 to 2006. Most of the instruments, 47.5%, were applicable to elderly populations. Nursing, when using validated instruments in its practice, provides more qualified care. Several behaviors and clinical manifestations exist, however, without validated instruments for their assessment. © Servicio de Publicaciones - Universidad de Murcia.},

abstract={Predation may drive differential selection among personality types, but the mechanism linking personality with predation risk is poorly understood. One such mechanism may be provided by stress hormones (corticosterone in birds), which are linked to boldness towards predators. However, because of feedbacks between boldness and future fitness expectations, the relationship between boldness and stress physiology may be modulated by individual quality. We investigated flight initiation distances (FIDs) of incubating eider, Somateria mollissima, females in relation to handling-induced corticosterone concentrations and individual quality (female breeding experience, body condition). We investigated whether FIDs were repeatable, and whether stress responsiveness and individual quality attributes, either independently or interactively, affected FIDs. We also analysed whether incubation duration, a period of peak predation pressure on females, would depend on female boldness towards predators (FID), controlling for individual quality. FIDs were repeatable within and between seasons, and females with higher handling-induced corticosterone concentrations generally had longer FIDs. However, this relationship was modulated by interactions between stress responsiveness and individual quality. High stress responsiveness was associated with longer FIDs in younger females, while the opposite was found for the oldest females. Furthermore, the FIDs of females in good body condition increased less strongly with increasing stress-induced circulating corticosterone. Shy females (long FIDs) and those in poor body condition had shorter incubation periods. Boldness is thus linked to stress responsiveness, helping to explain why stress responses may be correlated with survival. However, physiological stress effects on boldness cannot be understood in isolation from effects of individual quality. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Feeding decisions under predation risk can be a key in the life of scavenger organisms, and tuned recognition of predation alarm cues and flexibility in the response are fundamental. The effect of injured conspecifics on the response behavior of the whelk Buccinanops globulosum to feeding opportunities was experimentally evaluated in a Patagonian Bay (40°45′S, 64°56′W, Argentina) in September 2010. The effect of sex, size, body condition, or starvation on anti-predatory behavior was assessed. The number of B. globulosum feeding on carrion was reduced by half when damaged conspecifics were present. Smaller, lighter, and starved individuals responded less to the presence of damaged conspecifics. These results indicate that, under natural conditions, feeding avoidance after detecting damaged conspecifics is a common and important anti-predatory strategy of B. globulosum and show that morphology and starvation are significant factors in the context of the trade-off between feeding and avoiding predation risk. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The escape of fish from aquaculture is a persistent economic problem for farmers as well as an environmental problem that threatens wild fish population as a consequence of potential negative ecological and genetic interactions. Farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) cause significant damage by biting the net and creating holes through which they escape. We determined the role of food, cage enrichment, net damage, and individual temperament on net biting behavior. During four separate trials, net interactions by fish were observed in relation to combinations of the above treatments. Fish with no access to food and in plain (not enriched) cages interacted the most with the net wall, with 7.5 and 12.6 more interactions per h, respectively, than fish with food that were in enriched cages (food P=0.01; enrichment P<0.01). Of the stimulating objects used to enrich cages, 97% of interactions were with the tubes that provided refuge (P<0.01). Cod were attracted to damaged areas of net, interacting 0.12 more times per h than at undamaged areas (P<0.01). Individuals showed consistent behavior over time, but there was no relationship between temperament and net interactions (P=0.17). The results indicate that appropriate feeding levels and cage enrichment may lead to reduced net interactions and thus fewer holes, reducing the potential for fish to escape. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Many environmental conditions show rhythmic changes across the 24-h day; these include changes in light intensity, ambient temperature, food availability, and presence or absence of predators. Consequently, many organisms have developed corresponding adaptations, which ensure that specific physiological and behavioral events occur at an appropriate time of the day. In mammals, the underlying mechanism responsible for synchronizing internal biochemical processes with circadian environmental cues has been well studied and is thought to comprise three major components: (1) photoreception by the retina and transmission of neural signals along the retinohypothalamic tract, (2) integration of photoperiodic information with an internal reference circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and (3) dissemination of circadian information to target organs, via the autonomic nervous system and through humoral pathways. Given the importance that neuroendocrine rhythms play in coordinating normal circadian physiology and behavior, it is plausible that their perturbation during aging contributes to the etiology of age-related pathologies. This mini-review highlights some of the most dramatic rhythmic neuroendocrine changes that occur in primates during aging, focusing primarily on data from the male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition to the age-associated attenuation of hormone levels and reduction of humoral circadian signaling, there are also significant age-related changes in intracrine processing enzymes and hormone receptors which may further affect the functional efficacy of these hormones. Rhesus macaques, like humans, are large diurnal primates and show many of the same physiological and behavioral circadian changes during aging. Consequently, they represent an ideal translational animal model in which to study the causes and consequences of age-associated internal circadian disruption and in which to evaluate novel therapies. © American Aging Association 2011.},

abstract={Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been shown to cause adverse effects on a number of biomarkers of health in birds. POPs may impair immune function and alter the stress response, defined as a suite of behavioral and physiological responses to environmental perturbations. Recent studies have also proposed that POPs can induce oxidative stress. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies simultaneously assessing the potential damaging effects of POPs on the latter biomarkers. In this study, we examined the contribution of legacy (organochlorines; (OCs)) and emerging (flame retardants; PBDEs) POPs to individual variations in stress levels (feather corticosterone), humoral immunity (plasma immunoglobulin Y levels) and oxidative stress occurring in three breeding colonies of a top predator seabird, the Great skua (Stercorarius skua), distributed from temperate regions to the high Arctic: Shetland (60 oN), Iceland (63°N) and Bjørnøya (74°N). Our results demonstrated that plasma concentrations of OCs in Great skuas from Bjørnøya are among the highest in North Atlantic seabirds, with up to 7900μg/kg (ww) ∑OCs. Yet, a latitudinal gradient in POP levels was observed with all compounds being significantly higher in Bjørnøya than in Iceland and Shetland (on average 4-7 fold higher for OCs and 2.5-4.5 for PBDEs, respectively). Contrary to our predictions, skuas breeding at the least contaminated site (i.e., Shetland) experienced the poorest physiological condition; i.e., the highest levels of stress hormones (25% higher) and oxidative stress (50% higher) and the lowest immunoglobulin levels (15% lower) compared to the two other colonies. Finally, our results failed to point out consistent within-colony relationships between biomarkers of health and POPs. Overall, it is suggested that other ecological factors such as food availability could constrain physiological indicators more than anthropogenic contaminants. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Adolescence is an ontogenetic period characterized by numerous hormonal, neural, and behavioral changes. In animal models, adolescents exhibit greater levels of novelty-seeking behavior and risk-taking relative to adults, behaviors associated in humans with increases in impulsivity and elevated propensities to engage in drug and alcohol seeking behaviors. The current series of experiments sought to explore possible age-related differences in impulsivity when indexed using delay discounting in adolescent (postnatal day [P] 25-27) and adult (P68-71) female (Experiment 1) and male (Experiment 2) Sprague-Dawley rats. In both experiments, adolescents exhibited significantly greater levels of impulsive-like behavior in this test relative to adults-even when data were adjusted to account for baseline differences in activity levels (i.e., general nose-poking behavior) across age. Taken together, these results extend to both sexes previous findings of adolescent-associated elevations in impulsivity observed among male mice using delay discounting, as well as among male rats using other procedures to index impulsivity. That these age differences were observed among both male and female rats suggests that impulsivity may be a pervasive feature of adolescence, and contributes to the expression of risky behaviors during this ontogenetic period. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Rationale Prenatal exposure to nicotine has been linked to accelerated risk for different psychiatric disorders, including conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and drug abuse. We examine a potential link between prenatal nicotine exposure, hyperactivity, anxiety, nicotine consumption, and cognitive performance in rats. Methods Adolescent offspring of females exposed during pregnancy to 0.06 mg/ml nicotine solution as the only source of water and of a group of pair-fed females, used as a control for anorexic effects of nicotine, were evaluated in a battery of tests, including locomotor activity, the elevated plus maze, two-bottle free-choice nicotine solution consumption, the five-choice serial reaction time test (5-CSRTT) and a delay-discounting test. All tests were conducted between postnatal day (PND) 25 and PND 50. Results Nicotine-exposed animals expressed hyperactivity, increased number of open arms entries in the elevated plus maze and increased numbers of anticipatory responses in the 5-CSRTT. Decreased aversion for nicotine solution in the free-choice test and decreased numbers of omission errors in the 5-CSRTT were observed both in nicotine-exposed and pair-fed offspring. Neither nicotine exposure nor pairfeeding had an effect on impulsive choice in a delaydiscounting test. Conclusions Our study confirms deleterious effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on important aspects of behaviour and inhibitory control in adolescent rats and supports epidemiological findings that show increased levels of symptoms of ADHD and related disorders among those whose mothers smoked during their pregnancy. It also suggests a link between food restriction during pregnancy and addiction-related behaviours in offspring. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={Divergent diet menus could cause sympatric divergence of risk sensitivity; however, evidence is not yet available for the functional link between diet menu and risk sensitivity. We investigated risk sensitivity (measured as the discount intensity for probabilistic rewards) and diet menu (insectivory and granivory) among three sympatric species of tits (family Paridae): varied tits, Poecile varius, marsh tits, Poecile palustris, and great tits, Parus major, which form mixed-species foraging flocks in Japan. Binary choice tests, offering rewards of differing amount and probability, were conducted in the laboratory. Great tits and marsh tits were found to be risk prone (and more insectivorous), whereas varied tits were risk averse (and more granivorous). Diet menus were examined in the laboratory using behavioural titration tests between sunflower seeds and mealworms. The results of these tests were similar to patterns of food exploitation determined using stable isotope analysis (δ 13C and δ 15N contents) of blood samples from birds collected in the wild. Possibly, the dominant varied tits drove the other two species of tits towards different diet menus and unusually high risk proneness. In future, we should examine whether different interspecies interactions cause different risk sensitivity in other geographical environments. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The current understanding of methylmercury (MeHg) toxicity to avian species has improved considerably in recent years and indicates that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of MeHg through the diet can adversely affect various aspects of avian health, reproduction, and survival. Because fish-eating birds are at particular risk for elevated MeHg exposure, the authors surveyed the available primary and secondary literature to summarize the effects of dietary MeHg on the common loon (Gavia immer) and to derive ecologically relevant toxic thresholds for dietary exposure to MeHg in fish prey. After considering the available data, the authors propose three screening benchmarks of 0.1, 0.18, and 0.4μgg-1 wet weight MeHg in prey fish. The lowest benchmark (0.1μgg-1 wet wt) is the threshold for adverse behavioral impacts in adult loons and is close to the empirically determined no observed adverse effects level for subclinical effects observed in captive loon chicks. The remaining benchmarks (0.18 and 0.4μgg-1 wet wt) correspond to MeHg levels in prey fish associated with significant reproductive impairment and reproductive failure in wild adult loons. Overall, these benchmarks incorporate recent findings and reviews of MeHg toxicity in aquatic fish-eating birds and provide the basis for a national ecological risk assessment for Hg and loons in Canada. © 2012 SETAC.},

abstract={A husbandry advisory tool (HAT) was devised to help pig producers and their advisors identify and minimise possible risk factors for tail biting in finishing pigs. The prevalence of 83 risk factors identified from the literature and expert opinion was recorded on 65 commercial pig farms in England between May 2007 and July 2009. Those considered most important were associated with atmosphere/environment, environmental enrichment, the provision of food/drink and animal health factors. Forty-six farms received advice on minimising these risks and, of these, 27 also received a financial incentive to encourage the uptake of advice.A reduction in risk factors was observed on 42/57 farms visited at the end of the study, with the greatest reduction occurring on the farms that had been incentivised. However, farms not receiving advice also had reduced risk factors associated with atmosphere/environment and stocking density over the course of the study. In conclusion, while some risk factors are structural and require substantial capital investment to change, a significant reduction in the risk of tail biting can be achieved on many farms through the systematic evaluation and modification of management practices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Food is important to any animal, and a large part of the behavioral repertoire is concerned with ensuring adequate nutrition. Two main nutritional sensations, hunger and satiety, produce opposite behaviors. Hungry animals seek food, increase exploratory behavior and continue feeding once they encounter food. Satiated animals decrease exploratory behavior, take rest, and stop feeding. The signals of hunger or satiety and their effects on physiology and behavior will depend not only on the animal's current nutritional status, but also on its experience and the environment in which the animal evolved. In our novel, nutritionally rich environment, improper control of appetite contributes to diseases from anorexia to the current epidemic of obesity. Despite extraordinary recent advances, genetic contribution to appetite control is still poorly understood partly due to lack of simple genetic model systems. In this review, we will discuss current understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms by which animals regulate food intake depending on their nutritional status. Then, focusing on relatively less known muscarinic and cGMP signals, we will discuss how the molecular and behavioral aspects of hunger and satiety are conserved in a simple invertebrate model system, Caenorhabditis elegans so as for us to use it to understand the genetics of appetite control. © 2012 Copyright Korean Society for Integrative Biology.},

abstract={Introduction: The impact of health behaviors on the leading causes of death across the USA has been well demonstrated. However, limited focus has been placed on the leading health risk behaviors of rural Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) patients, a particularly underserved group. The current study was undertaken to examine the most common risk-taking behaviors of rural FQHC patients and to examine if risk-taking behaviors vary between insured and uninsured patients. Methods: A convenience sample of 199 patients was recruited at an FQHC in the rural US South. Participants completed a battery of demographic and health risk behavior assessments. Results: The most common risk behaviors were eating fried foods, not eating five servings of vegetables per day, not eating three servings of fruit per day, drinking caloric beverages, not exercising regularly, not wearing a seatbelt, having sex without a condom and smoking. Uninsured patients were more likely to talk on their cell phones while driving (p<0.001), more likely to text while driving (p=0.007), more likely to have unprotected sex (p=0.004), more likely to drink alcohol (p=0.043) and more likely to not seek medical care when needed (p=0.005). Conclusions: Rural FQHC patients demonstrated high levels of behavioral and health risk-taking, including dietary-, exercise- and traffic-related risks, in a context where traditional prevention methods have failed to penetrate. Differences exist between insured and uninsured patients, indicating that the reasons behind behavioral risk-taking may be context-specific and need to be explored further to help identify intervention targets that are culturally and situationally appropriate for diverse rural groups. © KB Smalley, JC Warren, J Klibert, 2012.},

abstract={Previous studies have reported an association between suicide and interpersonal dependency (IPD), but no study has examined whether IPD constitutes a state-dependent phenomenon or an enduring personality trait in this association. The aims of the present study were, firstly, to evaluate both the absolute and the relative stability of IPD as well as depression in suicide attempters and, secondly, to examine whether the relative stability of IPD was related to the depressive level rated on admission and/or at follow-up. The sample consisted of 41 suicide attempters evaluated on admission and 1 month later. The subjects filled in the Interpersonal Dependency Inventory (IDI) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The absolute and the relative stability of depression and IPD were analyzed using paired t-tests and Pearson's or intraclass correlation coefficients, respectively. The relative stability of IPD, taking into account the changes of the depressive level, was tested by two regression analyses. In the first regression analysis follow-up, the IDI scores were the dependent variable and the baseline IDI scores and BDI-II scores were the predictors. In the second regression analysis, the IDI change scores were the dependent variable and the BDI-II change scores were the predictors. Absolute and relative stability were demonstrated for IPD, whereas depression presented only relative stability. The IPD scores on admission were also significant predictors of the follow-up IPD scores after controlling for depression level. The 1-month duration of follow-up may be too brief to detect any decrease in the level of IPD. In conclusion, in contrast with the depression scores, the IPD scores presented short-term absolute and relative stability, and these results support the view that IPD is a stable personality trait in suicide attempters. The stability of IPD in suicide attempters suggests the interest of specific therapeutic approaches of this personality trait. Copyright © 2001 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have amassed showing that the risk of developing disease in later life is dependent upon early life conditions. In particular, altered maternal nutrition, including undernutrition and overnutrition, can lead to metabolic disorders in offspring characterised by obesity and leptin resistance. The adipokine leptin has received significant interest as a potential programming factor; alterations in the profile of leptin in early life are associated with altered susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders in adulthood. Maintenance of a critical leptin level during early development facilitates the normal maturation of tissues and signalling pathways involved in metabolic homeostasis. A period of relative hypo- or hyperleptinemia during this window of development will induce some of the metabolic adaptations which underlie developmental programming. However, it remains unclear whether leptin alone is a critical factor for the programming of obesity. At least in animal experimental studies, developmental programming is potentially reversible by manipulating the concentration of circulating leptin during a critical window of developmental plasticity and offers an exciting new approach for therapeutic intervention. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={According to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis intrauterine or postnatal adaptations to the environment causes morphologic, physiologic or metabolic changes that influence health later in life. These adaptations seem to be carried out through structural, functional and epigenetic modifications. Multiple animal models of cardiovascular programming have been developed, and a brief overview of well-known models and mechanisms is presented. However, developmental programming also offers a novel approach to prevent cardiovascular and related diseases through so-called Reprogramming: administration of appropriate or inhibition of deleterious perinatal factors in induced or genetic models ameliorated undesirable development that otherwise would inevitably have lead to more severe hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease. A comprehensive overview of these studies suggests that, in analogy to what has been previously recognised in programming, many quite different reprogramming interventions all have similar protective effects. Whether this is due to common final epigenetic pathways remains to be shown. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Obesity and the metabolic syndrome have reached epidemic proportions worldwide with far-reaching health care and economic implications. The rapid increase in the prevalence of these disorders suggests that environmental and behavioral influences, rather than genetic causes, are fueling the epidemic. The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis has highlighted the link between the periconceptual, fetal, and early infant phases of life and the subsequent development of metabolic disorders in later life. In particular, the impact of poor maternal nutrition on susceptibility to later life metabolic disease in offspring is now well documented. Several studies have now shown, at least in experimental animal models, that some components of the metabolic syndrome, induced as a consequence of developmental programming, are potentially reversible by nutritional or targeted therapeutic interventions during windows of developmental plasticity. This review will focus on critical windows of development and possible therapeutic avenues that may reduce metabolic and obesogenic risk following an adverse early life environment. © 2012 Vickers and Sloboda.},

abstract={Dopamine is widely associated with reward, motivation, and reinforcement learning. Research on dopamine has emphasized its contribution to compulsive behaviors, such as addiction and overeating, with less examination of its potential role in behavioral flexibility in normal, non-pathological states. In the study reviewed here, we investigated the effect of increased tonic dopamine in a two-lever homecage operant paradigm where the relative value of the levers was dynamic, requiring the mice to constantly monitor reward outcome and adapt their behavior. The data were fit to a temporal difference learning model that showed that mice with elevated dopamine exhibited less coupling between reward history and behavioral choice. This work suggests a way to integrate motivational and learning theories of dopamine into a single formal model where tonic dopamine regulates the expression of prior reward learning by controlling the degree to which learned reward values bias behavioral choice. Here I place these results in a broader context of dopamine's role in instrumental learning and suggest a novel hypothesis that tonic dopamine regulates thrift, the degree to which an animal needs to exploit its prior reward learning to maximize return on energy expenditure. Our data suggest that increased dopamine decreases thriftiness, facilitating energy expenditure, and permitting greater exploration. Conversely, this implies that decreased dopamine increases thriftiness, favoring the exploitation of prior reward learning, and diminishing exploration. This perspective provides a different window onto the role dopamine may play in behavioral flexibility and its failure, compulsive behavior. © 2012 Beeler.},

Various paths of parental influence are offered based on the literature on parental influences on children's emotion self-regulation. The parental paths include modeling, responses to children's behavior, assistance in helping children self-regulate, and motivating children through rewards and punishments. Additionally, sources of variation in parental influences on regulation are examined, including parenting style, child temperament, and child-parent attachment security. Parallels in the nature of parents' role in socializing children's regulation of emotions and energy intake are examined. Implications for future research are discussed. © 2012 Leslie A.

abstract={Background: Badgers are involved in the transmission to cattle of bovine tuberculosis (TB), a serious problem for the UK farming industry. Cross-sectional studies have shown an association between bite wounds and TB infection in badgers which may have implications for M. bovis transmission and control, although the sequence of these two events is unclear. Transmission during aggressive encounters could potentially reduce the effectiveness of policies which increase the average range of a badger and thus its opportunities for interaction with other social groups. Methods: Data were obtained on badgers captured during a long term study at Woodchester Park, UK (1998-2006). Many badgers had multiple observations. At each observation, the badger was assigned a "state" depending on presence of bite wounds and/or TB infection. Hence each badger had a "transition" from the previous state to the current state. We calculated the numbers of each type of transition and the time spent in each state. Transition rates were calculated for each transition category, dividing the number of such transitions by the total time at risk. We compared the rate of bite wound acquisition in infected badgers with that for uninfected badgers and the rate of positive M.bovis test results in bitten badgers with that in unbitten badgers. Results: The rate of bite wound acquisition in infected badgers (0.291 per year) was 2.09 (95% CI: 1.41, 3.08) times that in uninfected badgers (0.139 per year). The rate of positive M.bovis test results in bitten badgers (0.097 per year) was 2.45 (95% CI: 1.29, 4.65) times that in unbitten badgers (0.040 per year). Conclusions: We found strong evidence of both potential sequences of events consistent with transmission via bite wounds and distinctive behaviour in infected badgers. The complex relationship between behaviour and infection must be considered when planning TB control strategies. © 2012 Jenkins et al.},

abstract={Introduction: The phenomenon of sexual conflict has been well documented, and in populations with biased operational sex ratios the consequences for the rarer sex can be severe. Females are typically a limited resource and males often evolve aggressive mating behaviors, which can improve individual fitness for the male while negatively impacting female condition and fitness. In response, females can adjust their behavior to minimize exposure to aggressive mating tactics or minimize the costs of mating harassment. While male-male competition is common in amphibian mating systems, little is known about the consequences or responses of females. The red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) is a common pond-breeding amphibian with a complex, well-studied mating system where males aggressively court females. Breeding populations across much of its range have male-biased sex ratios and we predicted that female newts would have behavioral mechanisms to mitigate mating pressure from males. We conducted four experiments examining the costs and behavioral responses of female N. viridescens exposed to a male-biased environment.Results: In field enclosures, we found that female newts exposed to a male-biased environment during the five-month breeding season ended with lower body condition compared to those in a female-biased environment. Shorter-term exposure to a male-biased environment for five weeks caused a decrease in circulating total leukocyte and lymphocyte abundance in blood, which suggests females experienced physiological stress. In behavioral experiments, we found that females were more agitated in the presence of male chemical cues and females in a male-biased environment spent more time in refuge than those in a female-biased environment.Conclusions: Our results indicate that male-biased conditions can incur costs to females of decreased condition and potentially increased risk of infection. However, we found that females can also alter their behavior and microhabitat use under a male-biased sex ratio. Consistent with surveys showing reduced detection probabilities for females, our research suggests that females avoid male encounters using edge and substrate habitat. Our work illustrates the integrated suite of impacts that sexual conflict can have on the structure and ecology of a population. © 2012 Grayson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Sensory limitation plays an important role in the evolution of animal behaviour. Animals have to find objects of interest (e.g. food, shelters, predators). When sensory abilities are strongly limited, animals adjust their behaviour to maximize chances for success. Bats are nocturnal, live in complex environments, are capable of flight and must confront numerous perceptual challenges (e.g. limited sensory range, interfering clutter echoes). This makes them an excellent model for studying the role of compensating behaviours to decrease costs of finding resources. Cavity roosting bats are especially interesting because the availability of tree cavities is often limited, and their quality is vital for bats during the breeding season. From a bat's sensory point of view, cavities are difficult to detect and finding them requires time and energy. However, tree cavities are also long lasting, allowing information transfer among conspecifics. Here, we use a simple simulation model to explore the benefits of tree selection, memory and eavesdropping (compensation behaviours) to searches for tree cavities by bats with short and long perception range. Our model suggests that memory and correct discrimination of tree suitability are the basic strategies decreasing the cost of roost finding, whereas perceptual range plays a minor role in this process. Additionally, eavesdropping constitutes a buffer that reduces the costs of finding new resources (such as roosts), especially when they occur in low density. We conclude that natural selection may promote different strategies of roost finding in relation to habitat conditions and cognitive skills of animals. © 2012 Ruczynski, Bartoń.},

abstract={Background: Transitions in habitats and feeding behaviors were fundamental to the diversification of life on Earth. There is ongoing debate regarding the typical directionality of transitions between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and the mechanisms responsible for the preponderance of terrestrial to aquatic transitions. Snail-killing flies (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) represent an excellent model system to study such transitions because their larvae display a range of feeding behaviors, being predators, parasitoids or saprophages of a variety of mollusks in freshwater, shoreline and dry terrestrial habitats. The remarkable genus Tetanocera (Tetanocerini) occupies five larval feeding groups and all of the habitat types mentioned above. This study has four principal objectives: (i) construct a robust estimate of phylogeny for Tetanocera and Tetanocerini, (ii) estimate the evolutionary transitions in larval feeding behaviors and habitats, (iii) test the monophyly of feeding groups and (iv) identify mechanisms underlying sciomyzid habitat and feeding behavior evolution. Results: Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of molecular data provided strong support that the Sciomyzini, Tetanocerini and Tetanocera are monophyletic. However, the monophyly of many behavioral groupings was rejected via phylogenetic constraint analyses. We determined that (i) the ancestral sciomyzid lineage was terrestrial, (ii) there was a single terrestrial to aquatic habitat transition early in the evolution of the Tetanocerini and (iii) there were at least 10 independent aquatic to terrestrial habitat transitions and at least 15 feeding behavior transitions during tetanocerine phylogenesis. The ancestor of Tetanocera was aquatic with five lineages making independent transitions to terrestrial habitats and seven making independent transitions in feeding behaviors. Conclusions: The preponderance of aquatic to terrestrial transitions in sciomyzids goes against the trend generally observed across eukaryotes. Damp shoreline habitats are likely transitional where larvae can change habitat but still have similar prey available. Transitioning from aquatic to terrestrial habitats is likely easier than the reverse for sciomyzids because morphological characters associated with air-breathing while under the water's surface are lost rather than gained, and sciomyzids originated and diversified during a general drying period in Earth's history. Our results imply that any animal lineage having aquatic and terrestrial members, respiring the same way in both habitats and having the same type of food available in both habitats could show a similar pattern of multiple independent habitat transitions coincident with changes in behavioral and morphological traits. © 2012 Chapman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Previous studies have shown that housing mice with toys and running wheels increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis and enhances performance on the water maze. However, the relative contribution of running versus enrichment to the neurogenic and pro-cognitive effects is not clear. Recently, it was demonstrated that enrichment devoid of running wheels does not significantly enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis in female C57BL/6J mice. However, novel toys were not rotated into the cages, and dietary enrichment was not included, so it could be argued that the environment was not enriched enough. In addition, only females were studied, and animals were group-housed, making it impossible to record individual running behavior or to determine the time spent running versus exploring the toys. Therefore, we repeated the study in singly housed male C57BL/6J mice and enhanced enrichment by rotating novel tactile, visual, dietary, auditory, and vestibular stimuli into the cages. Mice were housed for 32. days in one of four groups: running-only, enrichment-only, running plus enrichment, and standard cage. The first 10. days bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to label dividing cells. The last 5. days mice were tested on the water maze, and then euthanized to measure number of BrdU cells co-labeled with neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) in the dentate gyrus. Mice in the running-only group ran, on average, equivalent distances as animals in the running plus enrichment group. The combination of enrichment and running did not significantly increase hippocampal neurogenesis any more than running alone did. Animals in the running-only condition were the only group to show enhanced acquisition on water maze relative to standard cage controls. We confirm and extend the conclusion that environmental enrichment alone does not significantly increase hippocampal neurogenesis or bestow spatial learning benefits in male C57BL/6J mice, even when the modalities of enrichment are very broad. © 2012 IBRO.},

abstract={Antlion larvae are typically considered as trap-building predators, but some species of antlions always forage without using pits or only sometimes use pits to capture prey; they can ambush prey without pits. This study examined a species that switches its strategy between pit-trapping and ambushing and asked the mechanism behind the switching behaviour. A dynamic optimization model incorporating tradeoffs between the two strategies was built. The tradeoffs were prey capture success and predation risk (both are higher when pit-trapping). The model predicted that antlions should use the trap-building strategy when their energy status is low and should use the ambush strategy when their energy status is high. These predictions as well as an assumption (i.e., predation risk associated with pit-trapping is higher than that associated with ambushing) of the model were empirically confirmed. The results suggest that antlions flexibly switch between pit-trapping and ambushing to maximize their fitness by balancing the costs and benefits of the two strategies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Boldness in animal personality studies is measured using a range of different behavioural assays, including responses to novel objects, novel environments and threatening stimuli. These assays should be correlated if they all reflect boldness, but this assumption has rarely been tested. We investigated experimentally whether presentation of threatening stimuli (a taxidermic puff adder, Bitis arietans arietans) and novel object (an unfamiliar food item) both assayed the same personality trait in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We recorded individual responses to both the snake model and novel foods for 57 baboons encompassing all age-sex classes in two study troops over 3 years. Surprisingly, those individuals that showed the greatest alarm responses to the model snake, that is, the least bold responses, also inspected it for longer. Furthermore, individuals' threat responses did not correlate with their response to the novel food. Thus, boldness according to one definition was not related to boldness using another definition. We suggest that threat-directed behaviours did not reflect individual boldness, but instead were indicative of another personality dimension: anxiety. These findings highlight that current boldness assays may not be interchangeable, and in some cases may not measure boldness at all. We stress the value of using multiple assays to measure the personality trait of interest. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Precopulatory sexual cannibalism may represent the most extreme form of sexual conflict because it necessarily truncates the reproductive potential of the victim. Three of the most prominent mechanisms invoked to explain incidence of precopulatory sexual cannibalism are the 'adaptive foraging', 'aggressive spillover' and 'mate choice' hypotheses. These hypotheses argue that sexual cannibalism is either (1) the result of female choice, where females gauge the benefits of suitors as perspective mates versus prey, (2) a neutral (or deleterious) by-product of selection on aggressiveness in nonreproductive contexts, or (3) a mechanism by which females express their mating preferences, respectively. We tested the predictions of these hypotheses in the funnel-web spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica using staged laboratory encounters. We then tracked numerous fitness proxies of cannibalistic versus noncannibalistic females to determine whether cannibalism was associated with increased female performance. We found that more aggressive females and those deprived of food were more likely to engage in precopulatory cannibalism. Cannibalism was not associated with male condition, male body size or female body size, nor with the mass of females' egg cases, the number of eggs therein, or the mass of individual eggs. In contrast, there was a positive association between the mass of the egg case and the number of offspring that emerged in cannibalistic females, but not in noncannibalistic females. Thus, offspring of cannibalistic mothers appear to have increased hatching success in heavier egg cases. This may represent a novel advantage associated with sexual cannibalism. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={An understanding of how animals alter their behaviour in relation to environmental conditions is a key element in the study of animal movement, foraging ecology and habitat use, and can provide valuable information for practical conservation and management applications. To exploit resources in heterogeneous landscapes optimally, foragers should intensively search in profitable patches while minimizing foraging activities in low-quality areas. We used first-passage time (FPT) analysis to identify and characterize area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour along the nightly movement paths of racoons. While FPT analysis has been successfully applied to a variety of pelagic species, our goal was to determine the ability of FPT to detect habitat characteristics associated with changes in searching behaviour for a terrestrial predator. Racoons, Procyon lotor, were tracked via radiotelemetry during their nightly movements. We found evidence of ARS behaviour in 55 of 58 paths, with racoons concentrating intensive searching bouts in areas with an average radius of 42.6 m (range 20-100 m). To test whether our detection of ARS represented an actual change in behaviour, we tracked five racoons in relation to an artificial food patch. We detected ARS behaviour during 9 of 10 occasions in which a tracked animal encountered the food patch. Racoons showed ARS behaviour in areas with abundant shallow water, and they moved quickly through openings and dry areas with sparse ground-level vegetation. Application of this method should prove useful for studies of habitat use and foraging ecology of terrestrial predators by providing links between animal movements and the environment. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Cryptic colour patterns in prey are classical examples of adaptations to avoid predation, but we still know little about behaviours that reinforce the match between animal body and the background. For example, moths avoid predators by matching their colour patterns with the background. Active choice of a species-specific body orientation has been suggested as an important function of body positioning behaviour performed by moths after landing on the bark. However, the contribution of this behaviour to moths' crypticity has not been directly measured. From observations of geometrid moths, Hypomecis roboraria and Jankowskia fuscaria, we determined that the positioning behaviour, which consists of walking and turning the body while repeatedly lifting and lowering the wings, resulted in new resting spots and body orientations in J. fuscaria and in new resting spots in H. roboraria. The body positioning behaviour of the two species significantly decreased the probability of visual detection by humans, who viewed photographs of the moths taken before and after the positioning behaviour. This implies that body positioning significantly increases the camouflage effect provided by moth's cryptic colour pattern regardless of whether the behaviour involves a new body orientation or not. Our study demonstrates that the evolution of morphological adaptations, such as colour pattern of moths, cannot be fully understood without taking into account a behavioural phenotype that coevolved with the morphology for increasing the adaptive value of the morphological trait. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Maintenance of health and the production of offspring are competing processes that can result in trade-offs. As vertebrates invest substantial resources in their immune system, it is crucial to understand the interactions between immunity and reproductive strategies. In the lizard Zootoca vivipara, females have condition- and context-dependent mating strategies. We predicted that, if the risk of infection is higher for polyandrous females, then polyandrous females should invest more in immune system while monandrous females should invest more in reproduction. In order to test our prediction, we captured 62 gravid females of known age in a natural population; we kept them until parturition to access to their offspring. Then, using microsatellite marker-based paternity analyses within litters, we determine the mating strategy of females (monandrous or polyandrous). Females were also challenged with PHA to estimate their inflammatory response. Our results show that polyandrous females have a higher PHA response than the monandrous females, and that monandrous females produce more males and more juveniles of better body condition than polyandrous females. The relationship between mating behaviour and immune function may have consequences for females and may shape the evolution of mating systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Aims:The pathogenesis of obesity remains incompletely understood and the exploration of the role of novel proteins in obesity may provide important insights into its causes and treatments. Here, we report a previously unidentified role for synphilin-1 in the control of food intake and body weight. Synphilin-1, a cytoplasmic protein, was initially identified as an interaction partner of alpha-synuclein, and has implications in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis related to protein aggregation.Subjects and methods:To study the in vivo role of synphilin-1, we characterized a human synphilin-1 transgenic mouse (SP1) by assessing synphilin-1 expression, plasma parameters, food intake and spontaneous activity to determine the major behavioral changes and their consequences in the development of the obesity phenotype.Results:Expression of human synphilin-1 in brain neurons in SP1 mice resulted in increased food intake, body weight and body fat. SP1 mice also displayed hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Pair-feeding SP1 mice to amounts consumed by non-transgenic mice prevented the increased body weight, adiposity, hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia demonstrating that these were all the consequences of increased food intake. Transgenic expression of synphilin-1 was enriched in hypothalamic nuclei involved in feeding control, and fasting-induced elevated endogenous synphilin-1 levels at these sites, suggesting that synphilin-1 is an important player in the hypothalamic energy balance regulatory system.Conclusion:These studies identify a novel function of synphilin-1 in controlling food intake and body weight, and may provide a unique obesity model for future studies of obesity pathogenesis and therapeutics. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={As the pace and extent of urbanization increase, an understanding of the mechanisms that shape wildlife communities in cities will be essential to their effective management. Predation could be an important determinant of the structure of these communities, but the research to date suggests a predation paradox: Vertebrate predator numbers increase with urbanization, whereas predation rates decline. We reviewed studies on predator abundance and the survival of terrestrial vertebrates in urban and nonurban contexts to evaluate whether the predation paradox is a widespread phenomenon. We conclude that there is substantial support for it. We discuss hypotheses to explain the paradox and suggest that urbanization has fundamentally altered trophic dynamics by reducing top-down control through multiple mechanisms and by increasing bottom-up forcing through the greater availability of anthropogenic foods. The hypotheses are summarized in a conceptual model that generates testable predictions designed to advance our understanding of trophic dynamics in metropolitan areas. © 2012 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

abstract={Background Parenting behaviours are influenced by a range of factors, including parental functioning. Although common, the influence of parental fatigue on parenting practices is not known. The first aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and parenting practices. The second aim was to identify parental psychosocial factors significantly associated with fatigue. Methods A sample of 1276 Australian parents, of at least one child aged 0-5 years, completed a survey. Demographic, psychosocial (social support, coping responses) and parental sleep and self-care information was collected. Hierarchical regression was performed to assess the contribution of fatigue (modified Fatigue Assessment Scale) to parental practices (warmth, irritability and involvement), and parenting experiences (Parenting Stress Index, Parenting Sense of Competence Scale). Hierarchical multiple regression assessed the contribution of a range of parental sleep, psychosocial (social support, coping responses) and self-care variables to fatigue when demographic characteristics were held constant. Results Higher fatigue was significantly associated with lower parental competence (β=-0.17, P < 0.005), greater parenting stress (β= 0.21, P < 0.005) and more irritability in parent-child interactions (β= 0.11, P < 0.005). Several psychosocial characteristics were associated with higher parental fatigue, including inadequate social support, poorer diet, poorer sleep quality and ineffective coping styles including self-blame and behaviour disengagement. Conclusions Fatigue is common, and results suggest that fatigue contributes to adverse parental practices and experiences. However, possible risk factors for higher fatigue were identified in this study, indicating opportunities for intervention, management and support for parents. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={To better predict effects of climate change and predation risk on prey animals and ecosystems, we need studies documenting not only latitudinal patterns in growth rate but also growth plasticity to temperature and predation risk and the underlying proximate mechanisms: behaviour (food intake) and digestive physiology (growth efficiency). The mechanistic underpinnings of predator-induced growth increases remain especially poorly understood. We reared larvae from replicated northern and southern populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common garden experiment manipulating temperature and predation risk and quantified growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency. The predator-induced and temperature-induced growth accelerations were the same at both latitudes, despite considerably faster growth rates in the southern populations. While the higher growth rates in the southern populations and the high rearing temperature were driven by both an increased food intake and a higher growth efficiency, the higher growth rates under predation risk were completely driven by a higher growth efficiency, despite a lowered food intake. The emerging pattern that higher growth rates associated with latitude, temperature and predation risk were all (partly or completely) mediated by a higher growth efficiency has two major implications. First, it indicates that energy allocation trade-offs and the associated physiological costs play a major role both in shaping large-scale geographic variation in growth rates and in shaping the extent and direction of growth rate plasticity. Secondly, it suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food chains, where damselfly larvae are important intermediate predators, will be higher in southern populations, at higher temperatures and under predation risk. This may eventually contribute to the lengthening of food chains under these conditions and highlights that the prey identity may determine the influence of predation risk on food chain length. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Natural selection eliminates phenotypic variation from populations, generation after generation-an observation that haunted Darwin. So, how does new phenotypic variation arise, and is it always random with respect to fitness? Repeated behavioral responses to a novel environment-particularly those that are learned-are typically advantageous. If those behaviors yield more extreme or novel morphological variants via developmental plasticity, then previously cryptic genetic variation may be exposed to natural selection. Significantly, because the mean phenotypic effect of "use and disuse" is also typically favorable, previously cryptic genetic variation can be transformed into phenotypic variation that is both visible to selection and biased in an adaptive direction. Therefore, use-induced developmental plasticity in a very real sense "creates" new phenotypic variation that is nonrandom with respect to fitness, in contrast to the random phenotypic effects of mutation, recombination, and "direct effects" of environment (stress, nutrition). I offer here (a) a brief review of the immense literature on the effects of "use and disuse" on morphology, (b) a simple yet general model illustrating how cryptic genetic variation may be exposed to selection by developmentally plastic responses that alter trait performance in response to "use and disuse," and (c) a more detailed model of a positive feedback loop between learning (handed behavior) and morphological plasticity (use-induced morphological asymmetry) that may rapidly generate novel phenotypic variation and facilitate the evolution of conspicuous morphological asymmetries. Evidence from several sources suggests that handed behaviors played an important role both in the origin of novel forms (asymmetries) and in their subsequent evolution. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.},

abstract={Predation threat-associated behavioral response was studied in Rana temporalis tadpoles to discover the importance of predators' visual and chemical cues (kairomones and diet-derived metabolites of consumed prey) in evoking antipredator behavior. The caged predators (dragonfly larvae) fed on prey tadpoles or insects (Notonecta spp.) and water conditioned with the predators provided the threat stimuli to the tadpole prey. The predators' visual cues were ineffective in evoking antipredator behaviors in the tadpole prey. However, exposure to caged tadpole-fed predators or water conditioned with tadpole-fed predators elicited predator avoidance behavior in the tadpoles; they stayed away from the predators, significantly reduced swimming activity (swimming time and distance traveled), and increased burst speed. Interestingly, exposure to water conditioned with starved predators did not elicit any antipredator behavior in the prey. Further, the antipredator responses of predator-experienced tadpoles were significantly greater than those exhibited by predator-naïve tadpoles. The study shows that R. temporalis tadpoles assess predation threat based exclusively on chemical cues emanating from the predators' dietary metabolites and that the inclusion of conspecific prey items in the diet of the predators is perceived as a threat. The study also shows that antipredator behavior in these tadpoles is innate and is enhanced during subsequent encounters with the predators. © 2012 Japan Ethological Society and Springer.},

abstract={Predation is a complex behavioural process and it is only through identifying the different factors influencing each stage that is it possible to understand the evolutionary processes driving the arms race between predators and prey. Using a long-term data set from Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, we investigated the importance of demographic, environmental, and prey-based factors in influencing the success of hunt stages of a stalking predator, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. The chase and overall hunting success were influenced by the age of the cheetah and prey size, while the effect of habitat features could only be seen in the stalk. Whether a stalk turned into a chase was dependent on prey size, and in the dry season on proximity to rivers. Contrary to expectation, the hunger level of the cheetah, the presence of cubs, and the type of habitat where the hunt took place had no effect on hunting success. Different factors thus affect the success of individual hunt stages, and the predation risk of prey is influenced not only by its size, the habitat it is in, and the age of the its predator, but also by hunt stage. This reveals an increased complexity of predation risk that has implications for predator and prey dynamics, especially in systems with multiple predator and prey species. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={For centuries, entire male pigs have been castrated to reduce the risk of boar taint. However, physical castration of pig is increasingly being questioned with regard to animal welfare considerations. Immunization against gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) provides an alternative to physical castration. Using the currently available commercial product (Improvac®; Pfizer Animal Health), a two-dose regimen of a GnRH vaccine is administered. After the second vaccination, a substantial increase in feed consumption has been reported, which may be associated with increased body fatness and decreased feed efficiency when compared with unvaccinated entire male pigs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a feed restriction on these traits and on the behaviour of 120 group-housed entire males (five pigs/pen) vaccinated against GnRH. The first vaccination was performed at 62 days of age and the second (V2) at 130 days of age. Pigs were slaughtered in two batches 4 to 5 weeks after V2. They were either offered feed ad libitum over the 22 to 114 kg BW range (AL treatment) or ad libitum up to a maximum of 2.50 (R2.50 treatment) or 2.75 kg/day per pig (R2.75 treatment). Behavioural observations and skin lesion scoring were conducted 1 week before V2, and 1 and 3 weeks after V2. At slaughter, the volumetric lean meat content was measured using an X-ray computed tomography scanner. Between V2 and slaughter, the average feed intakes for the R2.75 and R2.50 treatments were 15% and 22% lower than the average AL feed intake (3.20 kg/day), respectively. Feed restriction was associated with a reduced average daily gain after V2 (846, 932 and 1061 g/day in the R2.50, R2.75 and AL groups, P < 0.01) but had no effect on the feed conversion ratio (3.00 kg feed/kg BW gain on average, P = 0.62). No difference was observed in the lean meat content (71.8%, 70.7% and 70.4% in the R2.50, R2.75 and AL groups, P = 0.14), despite a reduced backfat thickness measured in restrictively fed pigs (12.0, 13.0 and 13.6 mm in the R2.50, R2.75 and AL groups, P < 0.01). Higher skin lesion scores were observed 3 weeks after V2 in R2.50 and R2.75 pigs than in the AL ones (scores 33.4, 27.7 and 25.5, respectively, P = 0.04). These results, combined with an unimproved feed efficiency and no marked change in carcass characteristics, suggest that immunologically castrated pigs should not be restrictively fed during the late finishing period. © The Animal Consortium 2011.},

abstract={Extreme developmental plasticity within the eusocial insects defines the separation between the queen and worker castes. The switch between these 2 developmental pathways is thought to be under tight social control. Although a large emphasis has been placed on the effect of larval nutrition on caste determination, workers of many species have no direct control over larval feeding. This may be particularly relevant to the early evolution of ants, when behaviors that allow fine control over larval nutrition, such as mouth-to-mouth food exchange between larvae and workers, were probably not yet present. We investigated larval-directed aggression as an alternative means to regulate queen development in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, a species that retains ancestral characteristics. We tested worker response toward natural queen-destined larvae and larvae induced to develop as queens using a juvenile hormone analog (JHA). Workers from colonies that were not rearing queens bit queen-destined larvae, whereas worker-destined larvae were not attacked. When colonies were naturally rearing queens, workers did not bite JHA-treated larvae, and a larger proportion of these larvae developed into queens compared with larvae that received biting. This supports the hypothesis that workers of H. saltator use biting to inhibit queen development during periods when the conditions for queen rearing are not met. We propose that mechanical stress, in addition to nutrition, could serve as a mechanism to regulate queen development in species that lack fine control over larval food consumption, and this may have played a role during the early evolution of eusociality in ants. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={Suicide is a complex behaviour contributing to a significant number of unnecessary deaths worldwide. Accordingly, the quest for suicide risk factors is one of the most intensively developing issues of psychiatric research. In the last few decades a number of interesting results have been published about associations between season of birth (SOB) and several physiological and pathological aspects of human life, while, in regard to neuroscience, several investigations confirmed that SOB is associated with the risk of several major neuropsychiatric disorders and suicide as well. Research concerning the possible causative factors behind these associations were also performed suggesting that SOB-associated factors (including day length; seasonal changes in maternal nutritional status and vitamin D levels; seasonal alterations in incidence of some common infective disorders) contribute to neurochemical and consequentially temperament/personality trait alterations which may mediate the associations between SOB and psychiatric disorders. Other results indicate an uneven distribution of monoamine metabolism-related genotypes in different birth season cohorts possibly underpinning the effects of SOB. In our narrative review we summarize and discuss the available literature on the relevance of the most important findings concerning the above fields.},

Self-neglect has a number of serious consequences. It is an independent risk factor for early mortality among the aged. It commonly causes malnutrition, frailty and the deterioration of physical ability, therefore, increasing the risk of falls and fractures. Untreated medical conditions result in emergency visits and acute hospitalization. The neglect of housekeeping and financial affairs seriously affects the domestic environment. Diagnosis and treatment of self-neglect should be based on the medical and psychosocial assessment of a patient. Patients require multidisciplinary support at home or in hospital, and sometimes long-term care is inevitable. There is no sufficient scientific evidence to support the benefits of early intervention in self-neglect. Controlled studies are needed, especially to show whether early diagnosis followed by increased social support and tailored health care services have an effect on the outcome. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.},

abstract={Diets high in methionine lead to elevation of plasma homocysteine levels which are possibly linked to neurodegenerative diseases and oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated the effects of methionine-enriched diet on antioxidant defences, on rat spontaneous behaviour and on the ability to sustain long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG). Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a standard laboratory diet or a methionine enriched-diet (1% or 5% methionine in drinking water) for 8 weeks. After the 8 weeks, the animals were tested for spontaneous motor activity and habituation in an open field maze, for anxiety-like behaviour in an elevated plus maze and for the ability to sustain long-term potentiation (LTP) induced in the dentate gyrus under urethane anaesthesia. The brains were then removed and histochemically stained for superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Rats fed on 5% methionine significantly reduced total distance travelled during the open field test and exhibited no habituation with respect to the other two groups. Rats fed on 5% methionine also showed a significant increase of the anxiety level. Moreover, in this group, the ability to induce LTP in DG was impaired. SOD activity was significantly increased in the cerebral cortex of the rats fed on 1% and 5% methionine with respect to the control group. In conclusion, 5% methionine in drinking water led to evident impairment of locomotor skills and of synaptic plasticity. SOD activity in the cortex was increased in both the groups fed on 1% and 5% methionine, thus suggesting that metabolic adjustments, triggered by the methionine-enriched diet, are likely mediated by reactive oxygen species. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Studies on leadership have focused either on physiological state as the key predictor (i.e. "leading according to need"), or else on temperamental asymmetries among group members (i.e. intrinsic leadership). In this paper, we explore how both factors interact in determining the emergence of leaders. We observed pairs of sticklebacks with varying degrees of temperamental difference, and recorded their movements back and forth between a safe covered area and a risky foraging area, both before and after satiating one of the two pair members (but not the other). Before satiation, when the fish had similar hunger levels, temperament was a good predictor of social roles, with the bolder member of a pair leading and the shyer member following. The effect of satiation depended on which fish received the additional food. When the shyer member of a pair was fed, and consequently became less active, the bolder fish did not change its behaviour but continued to lead. By contrast, when the bolder member of a pair was fed, and consequently initiated fewer trips out of cover, the shyer partner compensated by initiating trips more frequently itself. In pairs that differed only a little in temperament, feeding the bolder fish actually led to a role reversal, with the shyer fish emerging as a leader in the majority of joint trips out of cover. Our results show that leadership emerges as the consequence of multiple factors, and that their interaction can be complex. © 2012 Nakayama et al.},

abstract={Clinical reports suggest a positive association between fat consumption and the incidence of hyperactivity, impulsivity and cognitive abnormalities. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying these disturbances under short-term conditions, we examined in Sprague-Dawley rats the influence of 7-day consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) compared to chow on anxiety, novelty-seeking and exploratory behaviors and also on acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmission that may mediate these behaviors. The HFD consumption, which elevated circulating fatty acids but produced no change in caloric intake or body weight, stimulated novelty-seeking and exploration in an open field, while reducing anxiety in an elevated plus maze. Using the Ellman assay to measure ACh esterase (AChE) activity that breaks down ACh, the second experiment showed HFD consumption to significantly reduce AChE activity in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus and midbrain. With measurements of [125I]-epibatidine or [125I]-bungarotoxin binding to nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) containing β2 or α7 subunits, respectively, the results also showed HFD consumption to increase both β2-nAChR binding in the medial prefrontal cortex and substantia nigra and α7-nAChR binding in the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus. When treated with an acute dose of the nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine (0.5 mg/kg, sc), the HFD animals responded with significantly reduced exploratory and novelty-seeking behaviors, whereas the chow-consuming rats exhibited no response. These findings suggest that the exploratory and novelty-seeking behaviors induced by dietary fat may be mediated by enhanced nicotinic cholinergic activity, which is accompanied by increased density of β2-nAChRs in cortical and midbrain regions associated with impulsivity and locomotor activity and of α7-nAChRs in hypothalamic regions associated with arousal and energy balance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies-the addition of energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries-can affect consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs, with longer overall food chain length.},

abstract={Oviposition behaviour is recognized as an ecologically significant trait in insects. Since herbivorous insect females have a potential to lay eggs on unsuitable host species, it is hypothesized that this behaviour may be the first step in host-range expansion. The most intriguing phenomenon, found in some insect species, is the ability of females to lay eggs on unsuitable places if hosts are unavailable; this behaviour is termed 'egg-dumping'. Egg-dumping can be adaptive plastic response in environments where hosts, either preferred or less suitable, may eventually become available. Transgenerational effects of this behaviour presume changes in larval feeding experience on different host species. Also, diverse larval experience may induce alterations in oviposition behaviour. To test whether egg laying behaviour of adult females can be modified by larval experience, we performed the experiment on two laboratory populations of Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say). First population (P) is housed in the laboratory on the common bean for 200 generations, whereas the second population (C) is derived from the first but has been raised for 197 generations on chickpea, a novel and less suitable host for larval development. In order to analyze differences between short-term and long-term effects of larval experience on eggdumping, both populations have been exposed to each host seed for one generation. The results of the study show that females from P population lay eggs more frequently in the absence of seeds when developed on chickpeas, compared with P females reared on beans. By contrast to P females, in C population, larval experience has no significant effects either on the number of dumped eggs or on the frequency of dumper females. These results demonstrate a significant inter-population diversification of phenotypic plasticity in egg-dumping behaviour depending on larval host experience. In other words, modification of oviposition behaviour, as a consequence of a long-term larval nutritional stress, can evoke previously unrecognized transgenerational effects.},

abstract={Inter-individual variation in diet within generalist animal populations is thought to be a widespread phenomenon but its potential causes are poorly known. Inter-individual variation can be amplified by the availability and use of allochthonous resources, i.e., resources coming from spatially distinct ecosystems. Using a wild population of arctic fox as a study model, we tested hypotheses that could explain variation in both population and individual isotopic niches, used here as proxy for the trophic niche. The arctic fox is an opportunistic forager, dwelling in terrestrial and marine environments characterized by strong spatial (arctic-nesting birds) and temporal (cyclic lemmings) fluctuations in resource abundance. First, we tested the hypothesis that generalist foraging habits, in association with temporal variation in prey accessibility, should induce temporal changes in isotopic niche width and diet. Second, we investigated whether within-population variation in the isotopic niche could be explained by individual characteristics (sex and breeding status) and environmental factors (spatiotemporal variation in prey availability). We addressed these questions using isotopic analysis and Bayesian mixing models in conjunction with linear mixed-effects models. We found that: i) arctic fox populations can simultaneously undergo short-term (i.e., within a few months) reduction in both isotopic niche width and inter-individual variability in isotopic ratios, ii) individual isotopic ratios were higher and more representative of a marine-based diet for non-breeding than breeding foxes early in spring, and iii) lemming population cycles did not appear to directly influence the diet of individual foxes after taking their breeding status into account. However, lemming abundance was correlated to proportion of breeding foxes, and could thus indirectly affect the diet at the population scale. © 2012 Tarroux et al.},

abstract={Central to theoretical studies of trophic interactions is the formulation of the consumer response to varying food availability. Response functions, however, are only rarely derived in mechanistic ways. As a consequence, the uncertainty in the functional representation of feeding remains large, as, e. g., evident from the ongoing debate on the usage of Ivlev, or Holling type I, II, and III functions in aquatic ecosystem models. Here, I refer to the work of Sjöberg in Ecol Model 10:215-225 (1980) who proposed to apply elements of the queuing theory developed in operational research to plankton-plankton interactions. Within this frame, food item processing is subdivided into two major stages which may operate with variable synchronicity. Asynchronous phasing of the two stages enhances the probability of long total processing times. This phenomenon is here termed feeding intermittency. Intermittency is assumed to determine the functional form of grazing kinetics, for which a novel grazing function containing a "shape" parameter is derived. Using this function, I evaluate the hypotheses that intermittency is influenced by (1) patchiness in the prey field (e. g., related to turbulence), and (2) the ratio of actual prey size to optimal prey size. Evidence for the first hypothesis arises from explaining reported variations in clearance rates of Acartia tonsa under different turbulence regimes. Further model applications to ingestion data for rotifers, copepods, and ciliates support the view that an increasing food size enhances intermittency and, this way, affects functional grazing responses. In the application to ciliate grazing, a possible prey density effect appears, possibly due to an intermittent activation of a feeding sub-stage. Queueing theory offers mechanistic explanations for transitions between Holling I-, II-, and Ivlev-type grazing. In doing so for variable prey size ratios, it may also refine size-based ecosystem models which are increasingly emerging in plankton ecology. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Invasive species present a global threat to natural ecosystems and native biodiversity. Previous studies have shown that invasive range expansion is often related to the invader's life histories and dispersal behavior. Among behavioral traits, boldness is a key trait that may aid species in performing well in novel environments. Thus, along a species' invaded range, individuals from the invasion front should be bolder, better dispersers, and have life histories that maximize population growth relative to established populations. We tested these hypotheses with the invasion of the African jewelfish Hemichromis letourneuxi in Everglades National Park (ENP). Jewelfish entered ENP in 2000, and since then they have expanded their range rapidly but traceably. Our study examined variation in reproductive investment, body condition, gut fullness, boldness, and dispersal behavior across six wild-caught populations of African jewelfish. Boldness and dispersal were tested using an emergence-activity test and an emergence-dispersal test in large, outdoor experimental setups. We dissected fish from the six populations to assess life histories. Populations from the invasion front (western ENP) had higher reproductive investment, higher gut fullness, and better body condition, but they were not relatively bolder nor better dispersers than inner populations (eastern ENP). As the invasion progressed, lower intraspecific density at the invasion front may have relaxed competition and allowed for higher fitness and reproductive investment. Understanding underlying behavioral and life-history mechanisms of an invasion is key for the development of management strategies that aim to contain current invaders and prevent the spread of future ones. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Nematomorph parasites manipulate crickets to enter streams where the parasites reproduce. These manipulated crickets become a substantial food subsidy for stream fishes. We used a field experiment to investigate how this subsidy affects the stream community and ecosystem function. When crickets were available, predatory fish ate fewer benthic invertebrates. The resulting release of the benthic invertebrate community from fish predation indirectly decreased the biomass of benthic algae and slightly increased leaf break-down rate. This is the first experimental demonstration that host manipulation by a parasite can reorganise a community and alter ecosystem function. Nematomorphs are common, and many other parasites have dramatic effects on host phenotypes, suggesting that similar effects of parasites on ecosystems might be widespread. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections and autoimmunity are associated with the onset of a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders in children, with the prototypical disorder being Sydenham chorea (SC). Our aim was to develop an animal model that resembled the behavioral, pharmacological, and immunological abnormalities of SC and other streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Male Lewis rats exposed to GAS antigen exhibited motor symptoms (impaired food manipulation and beam walking) and compulsive behavior (increased induced-grooming). These symptoms were alleviated by the D2 blocker haloperidol and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, respectively, drugs that are used to treat motor symptoms and compulsions in streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Streptococcal exposure resulted in antibody deposition in the striatum, thalamus, and frontal cortex, and concomitant alterations in dopamine and glutamate levels in cortex and basal ganglia, consistent with the known pathophysiology of SC and related neuropsychiatric disorders. Autoantibodies (IgG) of GAS rats reacted with tubulin and caused elevated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling in SK-N-SH neuronal cells, as previously found with sera from SC and related neuropsychiatric disorders. Our new animal model translates directly to human disease and led us to discover autoantibodies targeted against dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the rat model as well as in SC and other streptococcal-related neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

abstract={Opportunity for parasites to manipulate host behavioral phenotype may be influenced by several factors, including the host ecology and the presence of cohabiting parasites in the same host. Metacercariae of Ornithodiplostomum ptychocheilus and ''black spot'' Crassiphiala bulboglossa have similar life cycles. Each parasite uses a littoral snail as a first intermediate host, fathead minnows as a second intermediate host, and a piscivorous bird as a final host. Metacercariae of black spot encyst in the dermal and epidermal tissues, while metacercariae of O. ptychocheilus encyst on the brain over a region that coordinates optomotor responses. Because of site differences within the host, we predicted that O. ptychocheilus metacercariae might manipulate the behavioral phenotype of minnows to facilitate transmission to the final host, but metacercariae of black spot would not. In our study population, prevalence was 100% for O. ptychocheilus, with an overall median intensity of 105 metacercariae per minnow. Prevalence of black spot was 60%, with a median abundance and intensity of 12 and 20 metacercariae per minnow for the overall sample and for infected fish, respectively. Minnows accumulated both parasites over time, producing significant correlations between intensity and minnow body length and between intensities of the 2 parasites. Minnows infected with black spot had on average twice as many O. ptychocheilus metacercariae as similar-sized minnows without any black spot cercariae. We found no correlation between body condition of minnows and intensity for either parasite. We measured 2 aspects of anti-predator competence to test for effects linked to parasite intensity. We found no correlation between intensity of either species of parasite and latency to behavioral response to attack from a mechanical model heron, nor was there any effect of parasite intensity on a measure of shoaling affinity. The absence of any detectable effect of metacercariae on anti-predator competence in minnows may reflect selection against parasite pathology from predation by non-hosts of the parasites and overwinter mortality due to low dissolved oxygen. © 2012 American Society of Parasitologists.},

abstract={The trophic interactions of sea urchins are known to be the agents of phase shifts in benthic marine habitats such as tropical and temperate reefs. In temperate reefs, the grazing activity of sea urchins has been responsible for the destruction of kelp forests and the formation of 'urchin barrens', a rocky habitat dominated by crustose algae and encrusting invertebrates. Once formed, these urchin barrens can persist for decades. Trophic plasticity in the sea urchin may contribute to the stability and resilience of this alternate stable state by increasing diet breadth in sea urchins. This plasticity promotes ecological connectivity and weakens species interactions and so increases ecosystem stability. We test the hypothesis that sea urchins exhibit trophic plasticity using an approach that controls for other typically confounding environmental and genetic factors. To do this, we exposed a genetically homogenous population of sea urchins to two very different trophic environments over a period of two years. The sea urchins exhibited a wide degree of phenotypic trophic plasticity when exposed to contrasting trophic environments. The two populations developed differences in their gross morphology and the test microstructure. In addition, when challenged with unfamiliar prey, the response of each group was different. We show that sea urchins exhibit significant morphological and behavioural phenotypic plasticity independent of their environment or their nutritional status. © 2012 Hughes et al.},

abstract={The maternal environment has a significant role in the normal development of the fetus and may have long-term impact on brain development including critical central pathways such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonergic and the neurotrophin systems. For example, maternal malnutrition plays an important role in programming many aspects of physiology and behavior including predisposition to mental-health related disorders such as anxiety. Here we investigated the effects of maternal high-fat diet or control diet for nine weeks (prior to gestation, gestation and lactation) on the adult offspring with respect to anxiety related behaviors as well as exploration and conditioned fear response. We found that offspring born to high-fat diet mothers showed increased anxiety-like behaviors, but intact conditioned fear response and exploratory behavior. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was significantly increased in the dorsal hippocampus, while GABAA alpha2 receptor subunit and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor showed increased levels in the ventral hippocampus. In summary, these findings suggest that maternal high-fat diet consumption during critical periods in the development of the fetus, might increase the risk of abnormal behaviors in adulthood related to anxiety. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons are the major principal cell types of the hippocampus proper. The strongly recurrent collateral system of CA3 cells and the largely parallel-organized CA1 neurons suggest that these regions perform distinct computations. However, a comprehensive comparison between CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells in terms of firing properties, network dynamics, and behavioral correlations is sparse in the intact animal. We performed large-scale recordings in the dorsal hippocampus of rats to quantify the similarities and differences between CA1 (n > 3,600) and CA3 (n > 2,200) pyramidal cells during sleep and exploration in multiple environments. CA1 and CA3 neurons differed significantly in firing rates, spike burst propensity, spike entrainment by the theta rhythm, and other aspects of spiking dynamics in a brain state-dependent manner. A smaller proportion of CA3 than CA1 cells displayed prominent place fields, but place fields of CA3 neurons were more compact, more stable, and carried more spatial information per spike than those of CA1 pyramidal cells. Several other features of the two cell types were specific to the testing environment. CA3 neurons showed less pronounced phase precession and a weaker position versus spike-phase relationship than CA1 cells. Our findings suggest that these distinct activity dynamics of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells support their distinct computational roles. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..},

abstract={Understanding how animals partition effort between vigilance for predators and other conflicting activities has been a mainstay of animal behaviour research. Classical theories implicitly assume that animals alternate between high and low vigilance states over short timescales, but that average effort invested in vigilance is constant over an extended bout of such alternations. However, one recent model suggests that vigilance should be adjusted dynamically to short-term changes in the perception of predation risk and would tend to decrease with time. Indeed, as time passes by without disturbances, perception of the need for vigilance should decrease and prey animals may allocate more time to competing activities. Here, we examined how the proportion of sleeping gulls (Larus spp.) in loafing groups changed over time. Sleeping gulls can only maintain low levels of vigilance against external threats (compared to alert individuals), and we predicted that the proportion of sleeping gulls at loafing sites should increase over time when no disturbances occur. Statistically significant changes in the proportion of sleeping gulls as a function of time occurred in the majority of sequences and an increase was observed significantly more often than predicted by chance alone. This temporal pattern cannot be caused by reduction in hunger levels because gulls are not feeding at loafing sites. The results indicate that vigilance can be adjusted dynamically in response to short-term temporal changes in the perception of predation risk. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Objective: Poor prenatal nutrition has been associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the Netherlands and China, and it has been suggested that perinatal and postnatal nutritional factors lead to the development of schizophrenia and the exhibition of schizotypal traits later in life. There appears to be no prior research on the existence of possible factors that may mediate the relationship between malnutrition and schizophrenia spectrum disorders or whether this association is a direct one. The authors tested the hypothesis that low IQ mediates the relationship between early childhood malnutrition and adult schizotypal personality. Method: Participants were drawn from a birth cohort of 1,795 boys and girls who were followed prospectively. Objective indicators of malnutrition (anemia and stunting) were assessed at age 3. Verbal and performance intelligence were assessed at age 11, and schizotypal personality was assessed at age 23. Results: Both stunting and anemia at age 3 were associated with low IQ at age 11. Low performance IQ at age 11 was associated with increased interpersonal and disorganized features of schizotypal personality at age 23. Poor performance IQ was found to mediate the relationship between poor nutrition at age 3 and interpersonal and disorganized features of schizotypy at age 23. Findings in female participants were replicated in male participants. Conclusions: Given that poor nutrition is an alterable risk factor, these findings suggest that nutritional enhancements may improve brain functioning and possibly reduce some features of schizotypal personality disorder.},

abstract={Objective: To summarize the advantages and limitations of general population, high-risk and "natural experiment" longitudinal studies for studying psychological change. The English and Romanian Adoptees study is used as an example of a "natural experiment," and detailed findings are provided. Method: What is new is a focus on the young people who spent the whole of their life in institutional care up to the time of adoption and who did not show subnutrition. The results were compared with a composite comparison group who had not experienced institutional care or who were adopted before the age of 6 months. The outcomes were assessed in terms of previously established deprivation-specific patterns (DSPs). Results: "Pure" psychosocial deprivation was associated with a substantial increase in the rate of DSPs. It was not associated with significantly impaired head growth if institutional care lasted less than 6 months, whereas thereafter there was a 2.5 standard deviation reduction. Subnutrition differed in being accompanied by impaired head and body growth even with institutional care lasting less than 6 months. In the pure psychosocial deprivation group, 45.5% showed a DSP at 15 years compared with 1.3% in the comparison group. Conclusion: "Pure" psychosocial deprivation (in the absence of subnutrition) had a profound effect on psychological functioning in the form of DSPs. Subnutrition had a surprisingly small effect on DSPs. © 2012 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},

abstract={This article discusses the behavioral patterns, influencing factors, functions and risks of social play in primates, including information from published references and a study of Rhinopithecus roxellana by the authors. Social play involves the interaction between two or more individuals who often adjust to or influence the others′ behavior. Play behavior is common among immature primates and can affect present individual survival and future reproductive success. The categories of social play in primates include common behaviors such as chasing, wrestling and jumping. Some species have developed novel behaviors such as play panting in chimpanzees (Pan troglodyte), spinning in vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and bridging in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana). Generally, primates play most during late infancy and early juvenility, after which the average frequency of play behavior will gradually decline through adolescence to adulthood. The play behaviors of species which are evolutionarily closest to humans are more complicated and human-like than those of less developed species. Immature males often engage more in social play than females of the same age, but this varies with species, age and other factors, and in some cases the opposite is true. When selecting play partners, young primates appear to have a preference for partners who are kin, of the same sex, of similar age, and of similar dominance status because of the similarity in play motivation, less risk of being hurt, and the opportunity to form social allies. Individuals who prefer playing with partners of high dominance have increased access to food, water resources and opportunities for copulation. The frequency of play behavior of individuals living in high quality habitat is usually higher than that of individuals with low quality habitat. The same is true for individuals in larger groups and with an abundance of food compared to those in smaller groups and with a scarcity of food, respectively. Play behavior is also affected by play area, ambient temperature, familiarity among play partners and other environmental factors. For example, the play frequency of young golden monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) changes with the season. In conclusion, the development of social play in non-human primates is thought to be related not only to environmental parameters such as availability of food, configuration of the play area, group size and season but also to factors related to the community itself such as age, sex, kinship and relative dominance of play partners. While engaging in play behavior, immature primates can develop improved physical fitness and survival skills, establish social relationships, enhance cognitive ability, develop troop culture and adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. These skills facilitate the transition from infant to juvenile to adult and the ability to perform the social responsibilities expected at each stage. However, social play is also risky because individuals may get injured, disabled, or even die during play. Social play, as a kind of behavioral culture in primates, should be further studied, especially in less developed species. We believe future studies on primate play will be more innovative and of higher scientific rigor. What is currently known about social play in primates should be applied to their protection and utilization.},

abstract={Most organisms face the problem of foraging and maintaining growth while avoiding predators. Typical animal responses to predator exposure include reduced feeding, elevated metabolism, and altered development rate, all of which can be beneficial in the presence of predators but detrimental in their absence. How then do animals balance growth and predator avoidance? In a series of field and greenhouse experiments, we document that the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta, reduced feeding by 30-40% owing to the risk of predation by stink bugs, but developed more rapidly and gained the same mass as unthreatened caterpillars. Assimilation efficiency, extraction of nitrogen from food, and percent body lipid content all increased during the initial phase (1-3 d) of predation risk, indicating that enhanced nutritional physiology allows caterpillars to compensate when threatened. However, we report physiological costs of predation risk, including altered body composition (decreased glycogen) and reductions in assimilation efficiency later in development. Our findings indicate that hornworm caterpillars use temporally dynamic compensatory mechanisms that ameliorate the trade-off between predator avoidance and growth in the short term, deferring costs to a period when they are less vulnerable to predation.},

abstract={Introduction: The BeWEL study is aimed at assessing the impact of a personalised lifestyle programme on body weight in people at risk of developing colorectal adenomas. The study is a two-arm multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing the BeWEL lifestyle programme against usual care. Over 12 months, 316 people who have had a colorectal adenoma removed through the national screening programme will be randomised to provide 80% power to detect a weight loss (primary outcome) of 7% over 12 months. Methods: The 12-month intervention will be delivered by lifestyle counsellors via three face-to-face visits followed by nine monthly telephone support calls. Consultant endorsement for the study will be stressed. An individualised caloric prescription based on estimates for weight maintenance -600 kcal will be calculated. Motivational interviewing techniques will be used to identify personal motivations for weight change and ways to improve perceived self-efficacy. The programme will utilise personalised diet and physical activity data from baseline measures to set behavioural goals. A range of behavioural strategies will be employed to support lifestyle change including goal setting, identifying specific implementation intentions, self-monitoring and feedback. Emphasis will be placed on self-monitoring body weight, and weighing scales will be provided. Programme acceptability will be explored postintervention with indepth interviews. Compliance and impact will be assessed by baseline and follow-up measures of diet by self-report, activity by accelerometry and anthropometry. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics. Dissemination of results will focus on publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national/international cancer meetings and NHS groups. In addition, the work will be communicated to the public through forums such at The Scottish Cancer Prevention Network (http://www. cancerpreventionscotland.co.uk/). The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials No: ISRCTN53033856).},

abstract={Background: The trade-off between current and residual reproductive values is central to life history theory, although the possible mechanisms underlying this trade-off are largely unknown. The 'molt constraint' hypothesis suggests that molt and plumage functionality are compromised by the preceding breeding event, yet this candidate mechanism remains insufficiently explored. Methodology/Principal Findings: The seasonal change in photoperiod was manipulated to accelerate the molt rate. This treatment simulates the case of naturally late-breeding birds. House sparrows Passer domesticus experiencing accelerated molt developed shorter flight feathers with more fault bars and body feathers with supposedly lower insulation capacity (i.e. shorter, smaller, with a higher barbule density and fewer plumulaceous barbs). However, the wing, tail and primary feather lengths were shorter in fast-molting birds if they had an inferior body condition, which has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The rachis width of flight feathers was not affected by the treatment, but it was still condition-dependent. Conclusions/Significance: This study shows that sedentary birds might face evolutionary costs because of the molt rate-feather quality conflict. This is the first study to experimentally demonstrate that (1) molt rate affects several aspects of body feathers as well as flight feathers and (2) the costly effects of rapid molt are condition-specific. We conclude that molt rate and its association with feather quality might be a major mediator of life history trade-offs. Our findings also suggest a novel advantage of early breeding, i.e. the facilitation of slower molt and the condition-dependent regulation of feather growth. © 2012 Vágási et al.},

abstract={Background: Higher serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), an indicator of vitamin D synthesis and intake, have been associated with better mental health and cognitive function. Concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (the active vitamin D3 metabolite) have been associated with openness and extrovert behaviour, but 25(OH)D concentrations have not been associated with behavioural problems in humans. Methods: We investigated the prospective association between the different forms of 25(OH)D - 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2- and childhood behavioural problems in Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Serum 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 concentrations were assessed at mean age 9.9 years. Incident behavioural problems were assessed with Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention problems, peer relationship problems and pro-social behaviour subscales and total difficulties score) at mean age 11.7. Sample sizes varied between 2413-2666 depending on the outcome. Results: Higher 25(OH)D3 concentrations were weakly associated with lower risk of prosocial problems (fully adjusted odds ratio: OR (95% confidence interval: CI) 0.85 (0.74, 0.98)). Serum 25(OH)D3 or 25(OH)D2 concentrations were not associated with other subscales of SDQ or total difficulties score after adjusting for concfounders and other measured analytes related to vitamin D. Conclusions: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in childhood has important influences on behavioural traits in humans. © 2012 Tolppanen et al.},

abstract={Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling phenomenon. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour, which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations. Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity, exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age. Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off between current and future reproduction might maintain personality variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this life-history trade-off hypothesis. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Theoretical and empirical studies of life history aim to account for resource allocation to the different components of fitness: survival, growth, and reproduction. The pioneering evolutionary ecologist David Lack [(1968) Ecological Adaptations for Breeding in Birds (Methuen and Co., London)] suggested that reproductive output in birds reflects adaptation to environmental factors such as availability of food and risk of predation, but subsequent studies have not always supported Lack's interpretation. Here using a dataset for 980 bird species (Dataset S1), a phylogeny, and an explicit measure of reproductive productivity, we test predictions for how mass-specific productivity varies with body size, phylogeny, and lifestyle traits. We find that productivity varies negatively with body size and energetic demands of parental care and positively with extrinsic mortality. Specifically: (i) altricial species are 50% less productive than precocial species; (ii) species with female- only care of offspring are about 20% less productive than species with other methods of parental care; (iii) nonmigrants are 14% less productive than migrants; (iv) frugivores and nectarivores are about 20% less productive than those eating other foods; and (v) pelagic foragers are 40% less productive than those feeding in other habitats. A strong signal of phylogeny suggests that syndromes of similar life-history traits tend to be conservative within clades but also to have evolved independently in different clades. Our results generally support both Lack's pioneering studies and subsequent research on avian life history.},

abstract={Low food availability often coincides with pregnancy in grazing animals. This study investigated how chronic reductions in food intake affected feeding motivation, and metabolic and endocrine parameters in pregnant sheep, which might be indicative of compromised welfare. Ewes with an initial Body Condition Score of 2.7 ± 0.3 (BCS; 0 indicates emaciation and 5 obesity) were fed to attain low (LBC 2.0 ± 0.0,), medium (MBC 2.9 ± 0.1) or high BCS (HBC 3.7 ± 0.1) in the first trimester of pregnancy. A feeding motivation test in which sheep were required to walk a set distance for a palatable food reward was conducted in the second trimester. LBC and MBC ewes consumed more rewards (P = 0.001) and displayed a higher expenditure (P = 0.02) than HBC ewes, LBC ewes also tended to consume more rewards than MBC ewes (P = 0.09). Plasma leptin and glucose concentrations were inversely correlated to expenditure (both P < 0.05) and appear to be associated with hunger in sheep. LBC ewes were in negative energy balance, with lower muscle dimensions, plasma glucose, leptin, insulin, cortisol, and insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations and higher free fatty acids concentrations compared to HBC ewes; metabolic and endocrine parameters of the MBC ewes were intermediate. The high feeding motivation and negative energy balance of low BCS ewes suggested an increased risk of compromised welfare. Imposing even a small cost on a food reward reduced motivation substantially in high BCS ewes (despite high intake when food was freely available). Assessment of a willingness to work for rewards, combined with measures of key metabolic and endocrine parameters, may provide sensitive barometers of welfare in energetically-taxed animals. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={1.Individual- and population-level variation in body size and growth often correlates with many fitness traits. Predation and food availability are expected to affect body size and growth as important agents of both natural selection and phenotypic plasticity. How differences in predation and food availability affect body size/growth during ontogeny in populations adapted to different predation and competition regimes is rarely studied. 2.Nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations originating from habitats with varying levels of predation and competition are known to be locally adapted to their respective habitats in terms of body size and growth. Here, we studied how different levels of perceived predation risk and competition during ontogeny affect the reaction norms of body size and growth in (i) marine and pond populations adapted to different levels of predation and competition and (ii) different sexes. We reared nine-spined stickleback in a factorial experiment under two levels of perceived predation risk (present/absent) and competition (high/low food supply). 3.We found divergence in the reaction norms at two levels: (i) predation-adapted marine stickleback had stronger reactions to predatory cues than intraspecific competition-adapted pond stickleback, the latter being more sensitive to available food than the marine fish and (ii) females reacting more strongly to the treatments than males. 4.The repeated, habitat-dependent nature of the differences suggests that natural selection is the agent behind the observed patterns. Our results suggest that genetic adaptation to certain environmental factors also involves an increase in the range of expressible phenotypic plasticity. We found support for this phenomenon at two levels: (i) across populations driven by habitat type and (ii) within populations driven by sex. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={An individual's ability to identify and respond accurately to a predator greatly affects its probability of survival. Chemosensory cues are an important mechanism for predator detection in aquatic environments. Whether fish are aware of the risks posed by distinct fish species, or whether a common chemosensory cue distinguishes predatory fishes, is unknown. One possibility is that fish distinguish predatory fishes based on their diet. To test this, we manipulated the diet of three nominally nonpiscivorous species and examined behavioural responses of juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, to chemical cues of nonpredators fed a diet rich in fish product. In pairwise choice trials, naïve A. percula showed indifference to chemosensory cues from nonpiscivorous fishes fed their usual diet, but significantly avoided chemical cues from piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes fed a diet containing fish product. These results indicate that A. percula larvae innately distinguish between piscivorous and nonpiscivorous fishes based on chemosensory cues in the diet. To test for an effect of piscivorous diet in nature, we constructed patch reefs that emitted scents of dietary cues in natural concentrations. Patches that emitted scent of a piscivorous diet received on average 22% less settlement than control patches or than patches that emitted scent of an herbivore or invertivore. Chemosensory detection of recent prey provides a robust cue to assess predation risk associated with a diverse range of fishes (especially during settlement) and may be reinforced through additional sensory (e.g. visual) and learned recognition of individual species consistently associated with these distinctive chemosensory cues. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Twenty-eight Holstein Friesian dairy heifers were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments after calving. These experimental heifers were introduced to an established group of resident cows either between 0600 and 0800. h (i.e., after morning milking, a.m.) or between 1600 and 1800. h (i.e., after evening milking, p.m.). The size of the resident group remained constant at 18 animals (12 multiparous cows and 6 primiparous cows). There were 5 replicate or resident groups in total, and 2 to 3 nonexperimental primiparous cows in each group were replaced by a.m. and by p.m. heifers as they calved. Fresh total mixed ration was provided daily between 1000 and 1030. h, and concentrate feed was offered in the milking parlor. The behavior of the experimental heifers was assessed over a 2-h period immediately after mixing into the resident group, and also after feed provision during the first month in the group. In addition, time spent lying was assessed each week for 1 mo using data loggers attached over 24-h periods. The lying behavior and location of the entire group was also assessed by direct observations during the 2-h period before evening milking on 2 consecutive days each week for 1 mo. The time spent feeding by experimental heifers was recorded automatically using computerized feeding gates. Milk production, milk cortisol concentrations, and changes in body condition and body weight were also assessed over the first month after calving. Heifers in the a.m. treatment spent longer in receipt of aggressive behaviors such as threats, butts, and chases immediately after mixing compared with those in the p.m. treatment. During the feeding periods, heifers in the a.m. treatment were observed feeding for longer, showed less pen exploration, and also received more butts. No significant treatment effects were shown on overall feed intake levels, milk yield, milk cortisol concentrations, body weight, or body condition score loss. However, feed intakes were higher in the a.m. treatment during the second week after mixing, and automated recordings showed that a.m. animals spent longer average periods of time feeding. No significant treatment differences were shown in overall time spent lying, with heifers in both treatments lying for less than 4. h during the first 24. h in the group. Observations of the entire group showed that p.m. heifers spent less time lying than resident animals or a.m. heifers. In conclusion, the reduction in received aggression and the lack of adverse effects on performance (milk production and weight and condition loss) suggest that heifers should be introduced to the main dairy herd after evening rather than morning milking. Further research to determine the relative importance of time of day and time since feeding on behavior immediately after mixing would be beneficial. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Background: Heightened stress reactivity is associated with hippocampal atrophy, age-related cognitive deficits, and increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. This temperament predisposition may aggravate age-associated brain pathology or be reflective of it. This association may be mediated through repeated activation of the stress hormone axis over time. Dietary interventions, such as calorie restriction (CR), affect stress biology and may moderate the pathogenic relationship between stress reactivity and brain in limbic and prefrontal regions. Methods: Rhesus monkeys (. Macaca mulatta) aged 19-31 years consumed either a standard diet (. N=. 18) or were maintained on 30% CR relative to baseline intake (. N=. 26) for 13-19 years. Behavior was rated in both normative and aversive contexts. Urinary cortisol was collected. Animals underwent magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to acquire volumetric and tissue microstructure data respectively. Voxel-wise statistics regressed a global stress reactivity factor, cortisol, and their interaction on brain indices across and between dietary groups. Results: CR significantly reduced stress reactivity during aversive contexts without affecting activity, orientation, or attention behavior. Stress reactivity was associated with less volume and tissue density in areas important for emotional regulation and the endocrine axis including prefrontal cortices, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. CR reduced these relationships. A Cortisol by Stress Reactivity voxel-wise interaction indicated that only monkeys with high stress reactivity and high basal cortisol demonstrated lower brain volume and tissue density in prefrontal cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala. Conclusions: High stress reactivity predicted lower volume and microstructural tissue density in regions involved in emotional processing and modulation. A CR diet reduced stress reactivity and regional associations with neural modalities. High levels of cortisol appear to mediate some of these relationships. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Threshold concentrations associated with adverse effects of dietary exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) were derived from published results of laboratory studies on a variety of fish species. Adverse effects related to mortality were uncommon, whereas adverse effects related to growth occurred only at dietary MeHg concentrations exceeding 2.5μgg-1 wet weight. Adverse effects on behavior of fish had a wide range of effective dietary concentrations, but generally occurred above 0.5μgg-1 wet weight. In contrast, effects on reproduction and other subclinical endpoints occurred at dietary concentrations that were much lower (&lt;0.2μgg-1 wet wt). Field studies generally lack information on dietary MeHg exposure, yet available data indicate that comparable adverse effects have been observed in wild fish in environments corresponding to high and low MeHg contamination of food webs and are in agreement with the threshold concentrations derived here from laboratory studies. These thresholds indicate that while differences in species sensitivity to MeHg exposure appear considerable, chronic dietary exposure to low concentrations of MeHg may have significant adverse effects on wild fish populations but remain little studied compared to concentrations in mammals or birds. © 2012 SETAC.},

abstract={There is growing evidence that individuals within populations show consistent differences in their behaviour across contexts (personality), and that personality is associated with the extent to which individuals adjust their behaviour as function of changing conditions (behavioural plasticity). We propose an evolutionary explanation for a link between personality and plasticity based upon how individuals manage uncertainty. Individuals can employ three categories of tactics to manage uncertainty. They can 1) gather information (sample) to reduce uncertainty, 2) show strategic (state-dependent) preferences for options that differ in their associated variances in rewards (i.e. variance-sensitivity), or 3) invest in insurance to mitigate the consequences of uncertainty. We explicitly outline how individual differences in the use of any of these tactics can generate personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity. For example, sampling effort is likely to co-vary with individual activity and exploration behaviours, while simultaneously creating population variation in reactions to changes in environmental conditions. Individual differences in the use of insurance may be associated with differences in risk-taking behaviours, such as boldness in the face of predation, thereby influencing the degree of adaptive plasticity across individuals. Population variation in responsiveness to environmental changes may also reflect individual differences in variance-sensitivity, because stochastic change in the environment increases variances in rewards, which may both attract and benefit variance-prone individuals, but not variance-averse individuals. We review the existing evidence that individual variation in strategies for managing uncertainty exist, and describe how positive-feedbacks between sampling, variance-sensitivity and insurance can maintain and exaggerate even small initial differences between individuals in the relative use of these tactics. Given the pervasiveness of the problem of uncertainty, alternative strategies for managing uncertainty may provide a powerful explanation for consistent differences in behaviour and behavioural plasticity for a wide range of traits. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={In the present medical context, the evaluation and the monitoring of factors other than mere physical symptoms are an urgent demand. In particular, the issue of quality of life (QoL) has become a relevant target in the treatment of cancer. However, the approach towards these aspects is not well standardized and the actual applications in a concrete setting are fragmented, left to personal or local initiative. If this is true for QoL in general, it is particularly relevant in the specific field of nutrition. Indeed, though the growing awareness of a correlation between chronic diseases and dietary habits has led to an increased interest in nutrition, both before and after cancer, very little is still known about the methods that measure this important variable of the QoL. Indeed, good nutrition may have a relevant impact on QoL, positively affecting both the physical and psychological well-being. Targeting this issue implies using proper instruments to both monitor and educate the patients. Hence, we argue that it is vital for oncologists to be able to individuate the best tool available in a specified context, so as to achieve an important goal with little effort, also adopting standardized strategies proved to be efficacious. In this framework, we briefly reviewed the tools more frequently reported in the scientific literature. We suggest that through a cognitive approach, it is possible to achieve important clinical targets, initially by understanding the patients' needs, values, and psychosocial factors involved in nutritional behaviour and food-related decisions, in order to develop a personalized approach. Hence, this is the only way to support concrete actions for promoting healthier diets, thus preventing recurrences, monitoring chronic conditions, and supporting a good QoL.

abstract={In this paper, we lay out the theoretical framework for using modeling approaches from behavioral ecology (in particular, state-dependent and game theoretical models) to predict the behavioral responses of central place foragers to changes in their food environment. We develop individual-based models of the state-dependent behavior of individual central place foragers over the course of a breeding season and show how our approach provides a framework for the prediction of trip lengths, foraging location, food delivery, and reproductive success. We formulate a common framework of models for northern fur seals (. Callorhinus ursinus), black-legged kittiwakes (. Rissa tridactyla), and thick-billed murres (. Uria lomvia), and provide worked examples parameterized to represent fur seals and murres. We then develop a game theoretic model at the colony-level for predicting the distribution of multiple individuals across space in the face of potential interference or facilitation, providing a worked example for kittiwakes. We demonstrate how these models can be used to predict near-term aspects of foraging behavior such as diet choice and trip destinations and durations at the individual and colony level. We show how (i) behavioral predictions can be translated into predictions of foraging success, (ii) foraging success can be scaled up to demographically relevant parameters such as survival and reproduction, and (iii) this approach can help predict impacts of environmental change on top-level predators. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Seabirds are central place foragers during the breeding season and, as marine food resources are often patchily distributed, flexibility in foraging behaviour may be important in maintaining prey delivery rates to chicks. We developed a methodological approach using a combination of GPS data loggers and temperature-depth recorders that allowed us to describe the behaviour of surface-feeding seabirds. Specifically, we tested whether differences in foraging behaviour of black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla could be linked with reproductive success by comparing 2 consecutive years at 2 sites. At Rathlin Island (Northern Ireland) during 2010, foraging differed markedly from that during 2009 and from that at Lambay Island (Republic of Ireland) during both years. Birds exhibited foraging trips of greater duration, travelled a greater total distance, spent more time in transit and spent longer recuperating on the surface of the water. This notable shift was associated with a decline in breeding success, with greater loss of eggs to predation and lower prey delivery rates, resulting in the starvation of 15 % of chicks. We suggest that food resources were reduced or geographically less accessible during 2010, with suitable foraging areas located further from the colony. Birds did not invest greater amounts of time attempting to catch prey. Thus, our results indicate that kittiwakes at Rathlin modulated their foraging behaviour not by increasing foraging effort through feeding more intensively within prey patches but by extending their range to increase the probability of encountering more profitable prey patches. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Animals are primarily limited by their capacity to acquire food, yet digestive performance also conditions energy acquisition, and ultimately fitness. Optimal foraging theory predicts that organisms feeding on patchy resources should maximize their food loads within each patch, and should digest these loads quickly to minimize travelling costs between food patches. We tested the prediction of high digestive performance in wandering albatrosses, which can ingest prey of up to 3 kg, and feed on highly dispersed food resources across the southern ocean. GPS-tracking of 40 wandering albatrosses from the Crozet archipelago during the incubation phase confirmed foraging movements of between 475-4705 km, which give birds access to a variety of prey, including fishery wastes. Moreover, using miniaturized, autonomous data recorders placed in the stomach of three birds, we performed the first-ever measurements of gastric pH and temperature in procellariformes. These revealed surprisingly low pH levels (average 1.50±0.13), markedly lower than in other seabirds, and comparable to those of vultures feeding on carrion. Such low stomach pH gives wandering albatrosses a strategic advantage since it allows them a rapid chemical breakdown of ingested food and therefore a rapid digestion. This is useful for feeding on patchy, natural prey, but also on fishery wastes, which might be an important additional food resource for wandering albatrosses. © 2012 Grémillet et al.},

A gradual decline in locomotor activity of the ad libitum fed rats has been determined during aging in the open field test. In the CR groups, 3-month-old rats exhibited lower levels of exploratory behavior, compared to rats on the control diet. 24-25-month-old CR rats exhibited higher levels of exploratory behaviour, compared to ad libitum fed animals of the same age.

abstract={The relationship between food restriction and subsequent dysregulation of food intake is complex, variable and long-lasting. The present study investigated in rats whether repeated cycles of food restriction and binge feeding opportunities may alter regulation of food intake by employing a test for sensory-specific satiety. Rats that experienced repeated food restriction-binge cycles maintained heavier body weights compared to rats that remained on continuous food restriction. In contrast to the control subjects, rats that alternated between food restriction and binge feeding failed to display sensory-specific satiety. During the first meal, there was a gradual decrease in the amount of food intake over a 40. min period. When presented with a second meal of the same food, these rats responded to the familiar food in a manner similar as to a novel food (i.e., comparable quantities of both types of food were consumed). Food restriction-binge feeding cycles may be considered as a form of stress, which in turn is associated with cross-sensitization to numerous behavioral responses. Therefore, we propose that stress-induced disruption of sensory-specific satiety reflects a sensitized response to food, in which the interaction between sensory and satiety factors are no longer the key regulators of food choice and meal cessation. Furthermore, a role for sensory-specific satiety in terminating food intake appeared to decline with the progression of the cycles, thereby contributing to a steady increase in body weight of rats that experienced restriction with bouts of binge feeding opportunities. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aerobic metabolism is fundamental for almost all animal life. Cellular consumption of oxygen (O 2) and production of carbon dioxide (CO 2) signal metabolic states and physiologic stresses. These respiratory gases are also detected as environmental cues that can signal external food quality and the presence of prey, predators and mates. In both contexts, animal nervous systems are endowed with mechanisms for sensing O 2/CO 2 to trigger appropriate behaviors and maintain homeostasis of internal O 2/CO 2. Although different animal species show different behavioral responses to O 2/CO 2, some underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways that function in the detection of respiratory gases are fundamentally similar and evolutionarily conserved. Studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have identified roles for cyclic nucleotide signaling and the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional pathway in mediating behavioral responses to respiratory gases. Understanding how simple invertebrate nervous systems detect respiratory gases to control behavior might reveal general principles common to nematodes, insects and vertebrates that function in the molecular sensing of respiratory gases and the neural control of animal behaviors. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Behavioural innovations may have far-reaching evolutionary and ecological consequences, allowing individuals to obtain new resources and cope with environmental change. However, as innovations are rarely observed in nature, their emergence is poorly understood. What drives individuals to innovate, and what psychological mechanisms allow them to do so? We used three novel food extraction tasks to address these questions in groups of wild meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Innovatory tendencies were unrelated to body condition and foraging success, but were affected by age, rank and sex. Juvenile individuals were most likely to interact with tasks, but seldom solved them, perhaps owing to their small size or lack of dexterity. Instead, adult subordinates made up the bulk of the innovators. In cooperatively breeding societies, the inability of subordinate helpers to compete physically with dominant breeders may drive them to seek out solutions to novel problems. Most innovators were males, which, as the dispersing sex, may be particularly prone to solve novel problems, and innovators virtually always persisted longer than other group members when interacting with tasks. Most successful individuals solved tasks more than once, and learned to inhibit ineffective prepotent responses across successive presentations of the same task. They did not learn to manipulate functional parts of the apparatus more efficiently, however, nor did they extract general rules allowing them to solve novel tasks faster. Contrary to recent suggestions that innovation may be cognitively demanding, these results suggest that simple, conserved learning processes and dogged perseverance may suffice to generate solutions to novel problems. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Prey availability affects many aspects of predators' life history and is considered a primary factor influencing individuals' decisions regarding spatial ecology and behavior, but few experimental data are currently available. Snakes may represent ideal model organisms relative to other animal groups for addressing such resource dependency, due to a presumably more direct link between food resources and many aspects of behavior and natural history. We experimentally investigated the relationship between food intake and spatial behavior in a population of the snake . Bothrops asper in a Costa Rican lowland rainforest. Six adult snakes were allowed to forage naturally while six were offered supplemental food in the field, with both groups monitored using radiotelemetry. Mean home range size did not differ between groups presumably due to small sample size, but supplementally fed snakes demonstrated altered patterns of macro- and microhabitat selection, shorter and less frequent movements, and increased mass acquisition. Fed snakes also devoted less time to foraging efforts, instead more frequently remaining inactive and utilizing shelter. Because snakes were always fed in situ and not at designated feeding stations, observed shifts in habitat selection are not explained by animals simply moving to areas of higher food availability. Rather, . B. asper may have moved to swamps in order to feed on amphibians when necessary, but remained in preferred forest habitat when food was otherwise abundant. The strong behavioral and spatiotemporal responses of snakes in this population may have been influenced by an overall scarcity of mammalian prey during the study period. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

This metabolite was not present in chromatograms of fish that were fed pyrene-spiked food pellets.In addition, the strongly bound tissue residue of L. variegatus, which was nonextractable neither by organic solvents nor by the proteolytic enzyme Proteinase K, was most likely not available for the fish through diet.Altogether, the present study shows that the metabolites of pyrene produced at low levels of the food chain may be potentially available for upper levels through diet, raising a concern about their potential toxicity to predators and supporting their inclusion in the risk assessment of PAHs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In poultry farming, selection for high production, as for growth rate or feed efficiency, may be associated with risks for animal welfare. In this study, we tested whether divergent selection for a new trait linked to feed efficiency, i.e. digestibility, had correlated side effects on the behaviours of broiler chickens. Digestibility was assessed from apparent metabolisable energy values corrected to zero nitrogen balance (AMEn). We tested the behaviours of 80 broiler chickens from a divergent selection experiment for high (D+ line, 40 chicks) or low (D- line, 40 chicks) wheat digestibility. We used tonic immobility (TI), open-field and capture tests to evaluate the emotional reactivity of the birds. Social motivation was assessed with a runway test. Food consumption, food neophobia and exploration for food were also analysed. D+ birds had significantly longer duration of TI and latencies of the first step in the open-field and runway tests than D- birds. Our data thus suggest a higher emotional reactivity in D+ birds than in D- birds. On the other hand, D+ birds showed significantly lower latencies to approach novel food and were more willing to search for food in an open environment than D- birds. In the runway test, D- birds spent significantly more time away from the social stimulus than D+ birds. No significant difference was observed in the capture test results of the two lines. Feed consumption was significantly higher in D- birds than in D+ birds, but weight gain did not differ between the two lines during the first 3 weeks after hatching. Our results showed that selection indirectly affected different behavioural traits and different dimensions of fear behaviour. D+ birds expressed higher inhibition in novel environments (TI, open-field and runway tests) than D- birds. However, in the presence of food (novel food and exploration for food tests), the opposite behaviour was observed. Food rewards might have had a higher positive hedonic value in D+ birds than in D- birds and reduce D+ birds' fear level. Behavioural differences as a result of divergent digestibility could potentially be due to 'co-selection' or genetic drift. Further investigations are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and be able to select animals with genotypes associated with traits beneficial for both the environment and animal welfare. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A model hypothesizing that basic mechanisms of associative learning and generalization underlie object categorization in vertebrates can account for a large body of animal and human data. Here, we report two experiments which implicate error-driven associative learning in pigeons' recognition of objects across changes in viewpoint. Experiment 1 found that object recognition across changes in viewpoint depends on how well each view predicts reward. Analyses of generalization performance, spatial position of pecks to images, and learning curves all showed behavioral patterns analogous to those found in prior studies of relative validity in associative learning. In Experiment 2, pigeons were trained to recognize objects from multiple viewpoints, which usually promotes robust performance at novel views of the trained objects. However, when the objects possessed a salient, informative metric property for solving the task, the pigeons did not show view-invariant recognition of the training objects, a result analogous to the overshadowing effect in associative learning. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Forty of 109 papers covered pain, suffering, injury and disease, compared to 69 across four other themes in the AWA. Twelve papers were identified as focusing on welfare assessment and clinical decision-making.

Those preparations have proved successful in replicating many Pavlovian phenomena. In the present paper we tested a novel associative learning preparation in which visually presented letters were paired with a visual outcome. Reaction times (RTs) were recorded to assess associative strength between specific cues and the outcome. Combining two different dependent variables (RTs and type of response given), we propose a rule for evaluating the associative strength between two events. The preparation and the data transformation rule were successful in producing several Pavlovian phenomena including excitatory acquisition, extinction, overshadowing, and latent inhibition, as well as established summation effects. Advantages and limitations of this new preparation based on the use of RT are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose Overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, in particular carbonated soft drinks, promotes the development of overweight and obesity and is associated with metabolic disturbances, including intrahepatic fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome. One theory proposes that drinks sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup are particularly detrimental to health, as they contain fructose in its 'free' monosaccharide form. This experiment tested whether consuming 'free' fructose had a greater impact on body weight and metabolic abnormalities than when consumed 'bound' within the disaccharide sucrose. Methods Male Hooded Wistar rats were given free access for 56 days to 10% sucrose (Group Suc), 10%, 50/50 fructose/glucose (Group FrucGluc) or water control drinks (Group Control), plus chow. Caloric intake and body weights were measured throughout the protocol, and the following metabolic indices were determined between days 54 and 56: serum triglycerides, liver triglycerides, retroperitoneal fat and oral glucose tolerance. Results Animals with access to sugar beverages consumed 20% more calories, but did not show greater weight gain than controls. Nevertheless, they developed larger abdominal fat pads, higher triglyceride levels and exhibited impaired insulin/glucose homeostasis. Comparison of the two sugars revealed increased fasting glycaemia in the FrucGluc group, but not in Suc group, whereas the Suc group was more active in an open field. Conclusions A metabolic profile indicating increased risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease was observed in animals given access to sugar-sweetened beverages. Notably, 'free' fructose disrupted glucose homeostasis more than did 'bound' fructose, thus posing a greater risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={Animal experimentation in the Parkinson's disease (PD) field is a classic example of how the use of animal models to study diseases can have a significant impact on human health. Among the different neurotoxin-based animal models of PD that are presently available, the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) models have been established and validated as useful models for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed to treat motor symptoms and to study alterations of the basal ganglia that occur in this disease. The 6-OHDA rat model and the MPTP primate model have contributed enormously to translate animal experimentation into clinical practice, including pharmacological treatments and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. These models, along with the MPTP mouse model, are helping to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD. The roles of oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and impairment of the protein degradation pathways have also come under careful consideration thanks to these models. The more recently developed paraquat and rotenone rodent models are also contributing to our understanding of neuronal cell death. However, none of the neuroprotective strategies that have worked in the pre-clinical stage have thus far been successfully translated to a clinical setting to treat PD patients. At the same time, the lack of any effective neuroprotective strategy for PD is preventing the validation of any one particular model as a screening tool for such neuroprotective strategies. Therefore, it seems that we are trapped in a vicious circle that casts doubt on the suitability of the neurotoxin-based models for this purpose. Here, we discuss how epidemiological data may help to validate a specific model with data linking a lower risk of developing PD with nutritional/consumption habits or with a specific chronic drug therapy.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Neuroscience Disease Models. © 2012 IBRO.},

abstract={Organisms must find food and avoid enemies. Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) is a primary vector of Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of Pierce's disease, a deadly disease of grapevines and other plants. H. vitripennis feeds on xylem tissue depauperate in nutrients and has evolved many specialized physiological and behavioral adaptations. Bottom-up mortality risks to H. vitripennis include starvation and reduced fecundity through loss of quality hosts. Top-down risks include predation, egg parasitism by Hymenoptera, and fungal pathogens. Visual behavior of H. vitripennis in response to congeners, common heterospecifics, and artificial models of conspecifics was investigated. Behaviors and the physical properties of the visual cues involved were characterized. H. vitripennis adults exhibited highly significant, positive responses to conspecifics, a heterospecific species, Oncometopia nigricans, and artificial models the size of adult leafhoppers. Significant response was not observed to a congeneric, Homalodisca insolita, with a smaller body size, or to models of sizes, shapes, and colors other than black and red. Cadavers of leafhoppers placed on a novel and nutritionally poor host plant stimulated H. vitripennis adults to land on branches containing the cadavers. H. vitripennis also landed preferentially on branches containing conspecific cadavers despite the presence of a cadaver of a major predator, Anolis carolinensis lizards, or artificial lures resembling spiders. This consistent visual response was independent of variable bottom-up (host quality) and top-down (predator presence) risks, and it suggests for the first time such parsimonious behavior in insects, i.e., sole use of a live visual cue as a means to reduce mortality risks from bottom-up and top-down forces. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={In terms of the examination of the relationship between masculinity and health, there has been limited exploration of how the ways in which formerly incarcerated Latino men (FILM) construct their masculinities may conflict with public health messages. Using information gained from three years of ethnographic research that was conducted with formerly incarcerated Puerto Rican males in three urban communities in New York City, the authors examine what matters to FILM in terms of their health and well-being and what conflicts exist between public health prevention messages and FILM masculinity. Our results indicate the following: 1) major threats to the health of FILM, such as HIV risk behavior, alcohol and drug use and high caloric intake, are perceived as irrelevant to most of the FILM in the study; 2) young FILM believe that they engage in risky behaviors because of their " knucklehead" mentality and diminish their risks by becoming " street-smart;" and 3) social isolation, loneliness and general risk-taking behavior among FILM are salient issues that have yet to be effectively addressed. Of our sample of 32 FILM, we identified 7 individuals who have transitioned from having a " knucklehead" approach in their lives to possessing a greater sense of awareness of health and social matters. These seven individuals followed either or both of the following pathways: 1) pursuing a college education or 2) becoming community leaders. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The consequences of fetal growth retardation remain unclear, in part because they appear to vary between industrialized and developing countries. Data on body composition offer a new opportunity to investigate this issue, and may be of particular value in addressing the controversial role of nutrition in infancy, which has been proposed by some to boost survival, and by others to increase long-term risk of chronic diseases. The uncertainty regarding the effects of post-natal nutrition is presenting challenges to nutritional policy as many countries undergo the nutrition transition, whereby the nutritional status of individuals may shift within the life-course. A theoretical model, building on the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, is presented to clarify how body composition data can address this dilemma. Measurements of body composition can now be obtained in infants and children using several different technologies, indicating that large-scale studies can now be conducted to investigate objectively the association between early growth patterns and later health. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={Individual differences in human food neophobia (the reluctance to try novel foods) and food neophilia (the overt willingness to try novel foods) influence the evaluation of tastes and odors, as well as the sampling of such stimuli. Past research also notes an association of food neophobia to PTC sensitivity, body weight, and cephalic phase salivary response. The present study assessed physiological reactions of food neophobics and neophilics to pictures of food and non-food stimuli. Stimuli pictures were presented in random order on a computer screen for a period of 5. min. No significant differences were found between the groups in relation to non-food stimuli. However, pulse, GSR, and respirations were significantly increased in food neophobics when presented pictures of food stimuli. Thus, further evidence is provided to support a physiological component at least partially responsible for differences noted between neophobics and neophilics in sensitivity, psychophysical ratings, and "willingness to try" personality. Such a component may also lead to differences in weight, nutrition, and overall health. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Resilience, exhibiting intact psychological functioning despite exposure to trauma, is one perspective as to why some people who are exposed to trauma do not develop symptoms. This study examines the prisoner of war experience to expand our understanding of this phenomenon in extreme cases of trauma such as prolonged captivity, malnourishment, and physical and psychological torture. The study examined the United States' longest detained American prisoners of war, those held in Vietnam in the 1960s through early 1970s. A logistic regression analysis using resilience, defined as never receiving any psychiatric diagnosis over a 37-year follow-up period, as the outcome was performed (n = 224 with complete data). Six variables showing at least small effects emerged: officer/enlisted status, age at time of capture, length of solitary confinement, low antisocial/psychopathic personality traits, low posttraumatic stress symptoms following repatriation, and optimism. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) confirmed the significance and relative strength of these variables, with a range from OR = 0.54, 95% CI [0.13, 2.29] to OR = 1.11, 95% CI [1.04, 1.17]. When all variables were examined continuously and categorically, dispositional optimism was the strongest variable, accounting for 17%, continuously, and 14%, categorically. We discuss optimism as a protective factor for confronting trauma and the possibility of training to increase it. © 2012 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.},

abstract={Objective: To develop a youth form of the Motivators of and Barriers to Health-Smart Behaviors Inventory (MB-HSBI-Youth) for use in identifying self-reported motivators of and barriers to the following health-promoting behaviors (called health-smart behaviors): eating a healthy breakfast, eating healthy foods and snacks, drinking healthy drinks, and engaging in physical activity. Design: The MB-HSBI-Youth was developed through several research phases as part of a larger, multisite, and multicomponent study on modifying and preventing obesity in families. A critical aspect of the larger study was to identify the motivators of and barriers to the above-identified health-smart behaviors among African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino American, and non-Hispanic White American adults and youth. After preliminary research involving content validity, item analyses, and pilot testing, a pilot version of the MB-HSBI-Youth was administered to a national sample of 567 culturally diverse youth ranging from 9 to 17 years old. Results: Factor analyses and internal consistency results revealed the existence of multiple subscales measuring motivators of and barriers to each of the above-specified health-smart behaviors. Scores on the MB-HSBI-Youth correlated in expected directions with health self-efficacy scores and with ratings of the importance of health-related behavioral goals. Conclusion: The MB-HSBI-Youth may be a useful and novel tool for developing assessment-based, culturally sensitive health promotion programs customized to be responsive to the motivators of and barriers to health-smart behaviors identified in target communities, particularly those communities whose members are mostly racial/ethnic minorities. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Animals successfully navigate the world despite having only incomplete information about behaviorally important contingencies. It is an open question to what degree this behavior is driven by estimates of stochastic parameters (brain-constructed models of the experienced world) and to what degree it is directed by reinforcement-driven processes that optimize behavior in the limit without estimating stochastic parameters (model-free adaptation processes, such as associative learning). We find that mice adjust their behavior in response to a change in probability more quickly and abruptly than can be explained by differential reinforcement. Our results imply that mice represent probabilities and perform calculations over them to optimize their behavior, even when the optimization produces negligible material gain.},

abstract={Background: Research has shown that parental feeding styles may influence children's food consumption, energy intake, and ultimately, weight status. We examine this relationship, among recent immigrants to the US. Given that immigrant parents and children are at greater risk for becoming overweight/obese with increased time in the US, identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical.Methods: Baseline data was collected on 383 mother-child dyads enrolled in Live Well, a community-based, participatory, randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers. Socio-demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and child. Acculturation, behavioral data, and responses to the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) were also obtained from the mother.Results: The children's average age was 6.2 ± 2.7 years, 58% male. Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 ± 3.3 years, and are Brazilian (36%), Haitian (34%) and Latino (30%). Seventy-two percent of the mothers were overweight/obese, while 43% of the children were overweight/obese. Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding style as being high demanding/high responsive; 32% as being high demanding/low responsive; 34% as being low demanding/high responsive and 18% as being low demanding/low responsive. In bivariate analyses, feeding styles significantly differed by child BMIz-score, ethnic group, and mother's perceived stress. In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated (ß = 0.56) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01).Conclusions: Most mothers report having a low demanding/high responsive feeding style, which is associated with higher child weight status in this diverse immigrant population. This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding style may be a risk factor for childhood obesity. Further research is needed to help understand the larger socio-cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes. How parents establish a certain feeding style in their home country compared to when they move to the US " obesogenic" environment, should also be explored. © 2012 Tovar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Associations between parent and child characteristics and how they influence the approach parents take toward children in the feeding environment have not been examined extensively, especially in low-income minority families who are at a higher risk for obesity. The primary aim of the study was to examine positive and negative parent emotions as potential mediators of the relationship between child temperament and parents' perceptions of strategy effectiveness and problems encountered in feeding children fruit and vegetables.Methods: Participants were low-income families (n = 639, 73% minority, children aged 3-5 years) participating in Head Start programs in two states. Parents completed the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and measures of strategy effectiveness (teachable moments, practical methods, restriction, and enhanced availability) and problems encountered (vegetable characteristics, child attributions for dislike, external influences, and parental demands) in feeding children fruit and vegetables.Results: Positive parent emotions partially mediated the relationship between child Effortful Control and strategy effectiveness and fully mediated the relationship between Surgency and strategy effectiveness. Although negative parent emotions were associated with increased perception of problems in feeding children fruit and vegetables, the relationship between Negative Affectivity and problems in feeding was partially mediated by negative parent emotions.Conclusions: Positive parent emotions facilitated perceived effectiveness of feeding strategies, with child Effortful Control and Surgency instrumental to this process. Understanding mechanisms in parent-child feeding is important when developing interventions designed to promote healthy child eating behaviors. © 2012 Hughes and Shewchuk; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to individual life histories and to environmental variation. The reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis, however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk. Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10 m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG changed with respect to predation- and starvation-risk across treatments. This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population, and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play important roles in the evolution of personality. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Stone martens (Martes foina) are documented as generalist throughout their distributional range whose diet composition is affected by food availability. We tested if this occurs and what feeding strategies it follows in a typical Mediterranean ecosystem in Central Greece by analysing contents from 106 stomachs, seasonally collected from three different habitats during 20032006. Seasonal variation in diet and feeding strategies was evident and linked to seasonal nutritional requirements, but possibly imposed by strong interference competition and intraguild predation. Fleshy fruits and arthropods predominated in the diet, but also mammals and birds were frequently consumed. An overall low dietary niche breadth (BA =0.128) indicated a fruit specialization tendency. A generalised diet occurred in spring with high individual specialisation, whereas more animal-type prey was consumed than fruits. A population specialization towards fruits was indicated during summer and autumn, whereas insects were consumed occasionally by males. In those seasons it switched to more clumped food types such as fruits and insects. In winter it selectively exploited both adult and larvae insects and partially fruits overwinter on plants. The tendency to consume particular prey items seasonally reflected both the population specialist behaviour and the individual flexibility preyed on different food resources. © Copyright 2012 Dimitrios E.

abstract={Over the last century, major climate changes and intense human exploitation of natural living resources have occurred in the Southern Ocean, potentially affecting its ecosystems up to top marine predators. Fisheries may also directly affect seabirds through bycatch and additional food resources provided by discards. The past 20 yr of research has seen an increasing number of studies investigating the effects of climate change and fisheries activities on Southern Ocean seabirds. Here, we review these studies in order to identify patterns in changes in distribution, phenology, demography and population dynamics in response to changes in climate and fisheries bycatch. Shifts in distribution and breeding phenology were documented in parallel to increases in sea-surface temperatures and changes in sea-ice cover. Above all warm sea-surface temperatures negatively affected demographic parameters, although exceptions were found. Relationships suggest non-linear effects of sea-ice cover on demographic parameters and population dynamics, with optimum sea-ice cover conditions appearing to be the rule. Fishing efforts were mainly negatively related to survival rates, and only for a few species positively related to breeding success. A handful of studies found that chronic mortality of immature birds due to fisheries negatively affected populations. Climate factors and fisheries bycatch may simultaneously affect demographic parameters in a complex way, which can be integrated in population models to project population trajectories under future climate or fisheries scenarios. Needed are studies that integrate other environmental factors, trophic levels, foraging behaviour, climate-fisheries inter - actions, and the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity, such as some pioneering studies conducted elsewhere. © Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract={Individual behaviors of animals do not evolve separately; they do so in association with other behaviors caused by single shared genetic or physiological constraints and/or favored by selection. Thus, measuring behavioral syndromes-suites of correlated behaviors across different contexts-leads to a better understanding of the adaptive significance of variations in behaviors. However, relatively few studies have examined behavioral syndromes in wild animal populations in changing environments. We investigated a potential behavioral syndrome across antipredator nest defense, territorial defense, chick provisioning, and mating behaviors of male Black-tailed Gulls Larus crassirostris in two successive years under different conspecific territorial intrusion risks and food conditions. Males that presented high levels of antipredator nest defense (aggressive antipredator defenders) against a crow decoy (crows are egg predators) defended their territories against conspecific intruders more frequently than did other males (nonaggressive antipredator defenders), independent of the risk of intrusion. Aggressive antipredator defenders also fed their chicks more frequently than nonaggressive males, but only in a year of low food availability. Taken together, this indicates that males show consistent aggressiveness regardless of breeding context (antipredator and territorial defense), but can regulate food provisioning according to food availability. © 2012 Japan Ethological Society and Springer.},

abstract={Some evidence exists that cow body condition score (BCS) is associated with risks to animal health, and that higher BCS in extensively kept animals provides a buffer against cold conditions or other adverse weather events. Not surprisingly, measures of BCS feature in dairy cattle welfare assessment protocols. However, the degree to which BCS predicts welfare state, particularly in relation to the level of "hunger" experienced, is not well researched. The aim of this study was to examine associations between naturally arising variations in BCS in dairy cattle and time spent engaged in activities used as proxy indicators of hunger. Holstein-Friesian cows (n = 113) of either North American or New Zealand ancestry were allocated to 1 of 3 levels of concentrate-feed supplementation (0, 3, or 6. kg of dry matter/d) and also offered pasture in excess of requirements. Body condition score (1 to 10 scale), pasture dry matter intake (DMI), and time budgets for grazing, ruminating, standing, and lying were recorded during early, mid, and late lactation. Body condition score varied over a wide range (2.5 to 8.5) and, within genetic strain and supplementation level, was inversely associated with pasture DMI, rate of DMI, and the proportions of time spent grazing and ruminating. In comparison, variation in BCS (within genetic strain and supplementation level) was directly associated with variations in time spent lying (in late lactation). Nevertheless, pasture DMI and time spent in the key behavioral activities were all within the normal expected limits for pasture-fed dairy cows. Thus, thin cows appeared able to achieve their nutritional requirements. Furthermore, even though thinner cows traded-off a small portion of their lying time in late lactation to forage longer, they still rested for normal periods each day. Based on these results, we found no difference in the welfare status of naturally thin and fat cows when they were offered generous pasture allowances with or without concentrate supplementation. The extent to which this pertains under conditions of persistently low feed allowances that result in reductions in BCS remains to be determined. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Although a large proportion of molecules expressed in the nervous system are conserved from invertebrate to vertebrate, functional properties of such molecules are less characterized. Here, we show that highly conserved hydrolase AHO-3 acts as a novel regulator of starvation-induced thermotactic plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans. As wild-type animals, aho-3 mutants migrated to the cultivation temperature on a linear thermal gradient after cultivation at a particular temperature with food. Whereas wild-type animals cultivated under food-deprived condition showed dispersed distribution on the gradient, aho-3 mutants exhibited tendency to migrate toward higher temperature. Such an abnormal behavior was completely rescued by the expression of human homologue of AHO-3, indicating that the molecular function of AHO-3 is highly conserved between nematode and human. The behavioral regulation by AHO-3 requires the N-terminal cysteine cluster, which ensures the proper subcellular localization of AHO-3 to sensory endings. Double-mutant analysis suggested that AHO-3 acts in the same pathway with ODR-3, a heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit. Our results unveiled a novel neural protein in C. elegans, confirming its conserved role in behavioral regulation. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={1.'Compensatory growth' and 'catch-up growth' are often used interchangeably to describe the faster than optimal growth that occurs following a period of dietary restriction in the development of many animals. Concerns about the statistical analysis of these studies have drawn attention to the risk of false detection in reports of compensatory and catch-up growth. 2.This study aims to quantify the degree to which these compensatory responses occur across the animal kingdom. In addition, this study distinguishes the two terms, 'compensatory growth' and 'catch-up growth', to clarify the fitness consequences of rapid growth. Compensatory growth refers to a faster than usual growth rate, while catch-up growth implies attainment of control size. 3.Eight meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted on data extracted from 88 papers, including 11 taxonomic classes. The results confirmed that both growth tactics (i.e. compensatory and catch-up growth) occur across a wide range of taxa and result in decreased direct fitness components. 4.Importantly, the meta-analytic methods used made it possible to identify the specific experimental techniques that most successfully promoted rapid growth after restriction and key differences in the responses of the four major groups (mammals, birds, fish and arthropods) to dietary restriction. Endotherms are more likely to show a compensatory growth response because of their determinate growth; in contrast, the indeterminate and saltatory growth tactics of fish and arthropods reduce the pressure to rapidly achieve a large size. 5.Among the first meta-analyses to be conducted in this field, this study provides valuable support for the premises of compensatory and catch-up growth and also discusses weaknesses in experimental design, and possible solutions, in compensatory growth research. For example, we recommend conducting the experiment within the most linear phase of an animal's growth to avoid analytical complications arising from size-dependent growth, and our results indicate that dietary dilution more closely resembles quantitative restriction than clutch size and intermittent feeding restriction methods when normal quantitative restriction is not possible. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Boldness, a measure of an individual's propensity for taking risks, is an important determinant of fitness but is not necessarily a fixed trait. Dependent upon an individual's state, and given certain contexts or challenges, individuals may be able to alter their inclination to be bold or shy in response. Furthermore, the degree to which individuals can modulate their behaviour has been linked with physiological responses to stress. Here we attempted to determine whether bold and shy rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, can exhibit behavioural plasticity in response to changes in state (nutritional availability) and context (predation threat). Individual trout were initially assessed for boldness using a standard novel object paradigm; subsequently, each day for one week fish experienced either predictable, unpredictable, or no simulated predator threat in combination with a high (2% body weight) or low (0.15%) food ration, before being reassessed for boldness. Bold trout were generally more plastic, altering levels of neophobia and activity relevant to the challenge, whereas shy trout were more fixed and remained shy. Increased predation risk generally resulted in an increase in the expression of three candidate genes linked to boldness, appetite regulation and physiological stress responses - ependymin, corticotrophin releasing factor and GABAA - but did not produce a significant increase in plasma cortisol. The results suggest a divergence in the ability of bold and shy trout to alter their behavioural profiles in response to internal and exogenous factors, and have important implications for our understanding of the maintenance of different behavioural phenotypes in natural populations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={Organisms perceive changes in their dietary environment and enact a suite of behavioral and metabolic adaptations that can impact motivational behavior, disease resistance, and longevity. However, the precise nature and mechanism of these dietary responses is not known. We have uncovered a novel link between dietary factors and sleep behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary sugar rapidly altered sleep behavior by modulating the number of sleep episodes during both the light and dark phase of the circadian period, independent of an intact circadian rhythm and without affecting total sleep, latency to sleep, or waking activity. The effect of sugar on sleep episode number was consistent with a change in arousal threshold for waking. Dietary protein had no significant effect on sleep or wakefulness. Gustatory perception of sugar was necessary and sufficient to increase the number of sleep episodes, and this effect was blocked by activation of bitter-sensing neurons. Further addition of sugar to the diet blocked the effects of sweet gustatory perception through a gustatory-independent mechanism. However, gustatory perception was not required for diet-induced fat accumulation, indicating that sleep and energy storage are mechanistically separable. We propose a two-component model where gustatory and metabolic cues interact to regulate sleep architecture in response to the quantity of sugar available from dietary sources. Reduced arousal threshold in response to low dietary availability may have evolved to provide increased responsiveness to cues associated with alternative nutrient-dense feeding sites. These results provide evidence that gustatory perception can alter arousal thresholds for sleep behavior in response to dietary cues and provide a mechanism by which organisms tune their behavior and physiology to environmental cues. © 2012 Linford et al.},

abstract={Ideal free distribution (IFD) models predict that animals distribute themselves such that no individual can increase its fitness by moving to another patch. Many empirical tests assume that the interference among animals is independent of density and do not quantify the effects of density on fitness traits. Using two species of predatory mites, we measured oviposition as a function of conspecific density. Subsequently, we used these functions to calculate expected distributions on two connected patches. We performed an experimental test of the distributions of mites on two such connected patches, among which one had a food accessibility rate that was twice as high as on the other. For one of the two species, Iphiseius degenerans, the distribution matched the expected distribution. The distribution also coincided with the ratio of food accessibility. The other species, Neoseiulus cucumeris, distributed itself differently than expected. However, the oviposition rates of both species did not differ significantly from the expected oviposition rates based on experiments on single patches. This suggests that the oviposition rate of N. cucumeris was not negatively affected by the observed distribution, despite the fact that N. cucumeris did not match the predicted distributions. Thus, the distribution of one mite species, I. degenerans, was in agreement with IFD theory, whereas for the other mite species, N. cucumeris, unknown factors may have influenced the distribution of the mites. We conclude that density-dependent fitness traits provide essential information for explaining animal distributions. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={An individual's choice of habitat should optimize amongst conflicting demands in a way that maximizes its fitness. Habitat selection by one species will often be influenced by presence and abundance of competitors that interact directly and indirectly with each other (such as through shared predators). The optimal habitat choice will thus depend on competition for resources by other species that can also modify predation risk. It may be possible to disentangle these two effects with careful analysis of density-dependent habitat selection by a focal prey species. We tested this conjecture by calculating habitat isodars (graphs of density assuming ideal habitat selection) of chital deer living in two adjoining dry-forest habitats in Gir National Park and Sanctuary, western India. The habitats differed only in presence (Sanctuary) and absence (National Park) of domestic prey (cattle and buffalo). Both species are preyed on by Asiatic lions. The habitat isodar revealed at low densities, that chital live in small groups and prefer habitat co-occupied by livestock that reduce food resources, but also reduce predation risk. At higher densities, chital form larger groups and switch their preference toward risky habitat without livestock. The switch in chital habitat use is consistent with theories predicting that prey species should trade off safety in favor of food as population density increases. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Decapod crustaceans such as blue crabs possess a variety of chemoreceptors that control different stages of the feeding process. All these chemoreceptors are putative targets for feeding deterrents that cause animals to avoid or reject otherwise palatable food. As a first step towards characterizing the chemoreceptors that mediate the effect of deterrents, we used a behavioral approach to investigate their precise location. Data presented here demonstrate that chemoreceptors located on the antennules, pereiopods and mouthparts do not mediate the food-rejection effects of a variety of deterrents, both natural and artificial to crabs. Crabs always searched for deterrent-laced food and took it to their oral region. The deterrent effect was manifested as either rejection or extensive manipulation, but in both cases crabs bit the food. The biting behavior is relevant because the introduction of food into the oral cavity ensured that the deterrents gained access to the oesophageal taste receptors, and so we conclude that they are the ones mediating rejection. Additional support comes from the fact that a variety of deterrent compounds evoked oesophageal dilatation, which is mediated by oesophageal receptors and has been linked to food rejection. Further, there is a positive correlation between a compound's ability to elicit rejection and its ability to evoke oesophageal dilatation. The fact that deterrents do not act at a distance is in accordance with the limited solubility of most known feeding deterrents, and likely influences predator-prey interactions and their outcome: prey organisms will be attacked and bitten before deterrents become relevant. © 2012.

abstract={The study of animal cognition and its neurobiological bases often requires the adoption of associative learning procedures. Though fish are increasingly being used as a model system in behavioral neuroscience, the availability of adequate learning protocols can be a limiting factor in this field of research. This study describes a novel training procedure to explore visual discrimination in fish. Subjects were singly housed in rectangular tanks. At intervals, two stimuli were introduced at opposite ends of the tank and food was delivered near the stimulus to be reinforced. Time spent near positive stimulus in probe trials was taken as a measure of discrimination performance. To validate the method, we replicated two published studies that used operant conditioning to investigate the mechanisms of numerical discrimination in mosquitofish. Our data indicate a complete overlap of the results obtained using the two different methods. The pros and cons of the new procedure are discussed in respect of traditional associative learning paradigms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A tenet of life history evolution is that allocation of limited resources results in trade-offs, such as that between reproduction and lifespan. Reproduction and lifespan are also influenced proximately by differences in the availability of specific nutrients. What is unknown is how the evolution of the ability to use a nutritionally novel diet is reflected in this fundamental trade-off. Does the evolution of the ability to use a nutritionally novel food maintain the trade-off in reproduction and longevity, or do the proximate effects of nutrition alter the adapted trade-off? We tested this by measuring trade-offs in male milkweed bugs, Oncopeltus fasciatus, fed either an adapted diet of sunflower or the ancestral diet of milkweed. Sunflower-fed males lived longer but invested less in reproduction, both in mating and fertility. Milkweed-fed males invested in both mating and fertility at the expense of survival. The evolution of an expanded diet was not constrained by the existing trade-off, but instead was accompanied by a different trade-off between reproduction and longevity. We suggest that this occurs because diets differ in promoting germ line development or longevity. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Exposure to prenatal infections has been widely associated with the increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders of developmental origin such as schizophrenia and autism. Although several behavioral and cognitive deficits have been detected during adulthood in rodent models of prenatal infections, early behavioral changes have not been well characterized. In a prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model, we have previously observed significant alterations in the neuronal cytoarchitecture during early postnatal life. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of prenatal immune activation on early neurophenotypic presentations using a set of behavioral test battery. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with 100 μg/kg LPS (intraperitoneally) at gestational days 15 and 16. During the first postnatal week, we found no significant effect on maternal behavior or mother-pup interaction by this treatment. Also, no major changes in physical developmental milestones of pups were noted from postnatal (P) days P6 to P16. Importantly, prenatal LPS-exposed pups had a significant decrease in the number and duration of ultrasonic vocalization calls at P3 and P5. Prenatal LPS treatment also led to impairments in nest-seeking behavior and odor-stroke associative learning in neonatal rats at P8 and P9. At the molecular level, we detected significant decrease in the expression of cortical 5HT1A and 5HT1B messenger RNA at P3. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to an immune activator can significantly impair the social/communicative behavior in the neonate offspring, which may be relevant to childhood and premorbid abnormalities reported in autism and schizophrenia subjects. © 2010 The Author.},

abstract={We have previously reported that offspring of mothers fed a high fat (HF) diet during pregnancy and lactation enter puberty early and are hyperleptinaemic, hyperinsulinaemic and obese as adults. Poor maternal care and bonding can also impact offspring development and disease risk. We therefore hypothesized that prenatal nutrition would affect maternal care and that an interaction may exist between a maternal HF diet and maternal care, subsequently impacting on offspring phenotype. Wistar rats were mated and randomized to control dams fed a control diet (CON) or dams fed a HF diet from conception until the end of lactation (HF). Maternal care was assessed by observing maternal licking and grooming of pups between postnatal day (P)3 and P8. Postweaning (P22), offspring were fed a control (-con) or HF (-hf) diet. From P27, pubertal onset was assessed. At ~P105 oestrous cyclicity was investigated. Maternal HF diet reduced maternal care; HF-fed mothers licked and groomed pups less than CON dams. Maternal fat:lean ratio was higher in HF dams at weaning and was associated with higher maternal plasma leptin and insulin concentrations, but there was no effect of maternal care on fat:lean ratio or maternal hormone levels. Both female and male offspring of HF dams were lighter from birth to P11 than offspring of CON dams, but by P19, HF offspring were heavier than controls. Prepubertal retroperitoneal fat mass was greater in pups from HF-fed dams compared to CON and was associated with elevated circulating leptin concentrations in females only, but there was neither an effect of maternal care, nor an interaction between maternal diet and care on prepubertal fat mass. Pups from HF-fed dams went into puberty early and this effect was exacerbated by a postweaning HF diet. Maternal and postweaning HF diets independently altered oestrous cyclicity in females: female offspring of HF-fed mothers were more likely to have prolonged or persistent oestrus, whilst female offspring fed a HF diet postweaning were more likely to have irregular oestrous cycles and were more likely to have prolonged or persistent oestrus. These data indicate that maternal HF nutrition during pregnancy and lactation results in a maternal obese phenotype and has significant impact on maternal care during lactation. Maternal and postweaning nutritional signals, independent of maternal care, alter offspring body fat pre-puberty and female reproductive function in adulthood, which may be associated with advanced ovarian ageing and altered fertility. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Effects of gene variants in the fat-mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene (primarily rs9939609) on weight loss induced by lifestyle intervention are controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate whether FTO gene variations are associated with weight-reduction and changes in metabolic risk factors in response to a 14-week calorie restriction. In total, 204 Japanese women (aged 24-66 years; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) enrolled as subjects and attended dietary lectures instructing them on how to consume a nutritionally balanced diet of 1,200 kcal/day. Fat mass, both at baseline (P = 0.100) and after the intervention (P = 0.020), was higher in subjects with the AA genotype (n = 15; 7.3%) than in those with TT (n = 114; 55.9%) and TA (n = 75; 36.8%) genotypes. The change in fat-mass tended to be smaller in subjects with the AA genotype than in those with other genotypes (P = 0.065). However, the subjects with the risk allele could still decrease their body weight and improve metabolic risk factors significantly. Our data suggest that the impact of FTO rs9939609 in Japanese women may not be great enough to change body weight or metabolic risk factors in response to calorie restriction. Environmental and behavioral factors may overcome the effects of genes on weight reduction.},

abstract={Background: Previous studies have shown that prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine is associated with an increased risk for several psychiatric disorders. Variation in personality characteristics and in stress appraisal may underlie mental disorders. Aims: To investigate whether prenatal famine exposure is associated with personality characteristics and stress appraisal. Study design: Cohort study. Subjects: Participants included a total of 572 men and women, born as term singletons in a local hospital in Amsterdam around the time of the 1944-1945 Dutch famine. Outcome measures: Scores on the Big Five Inventory and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the personality traits openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism or in PSS scores between those unexposed and those exposed to famine during early, mid or late gestation. However, there were statistically significant (P=0.01) and borderline significant interactions (P=0.07) respectively between exposure to famine during early gestation and sex on conscientiousness and agreeableness. Subsequent analyses showed that men exposed to famine during early gestation had lower conscientiousness scores and women exposed during early gestation had higher agreeableness scores. Conclusions: We conclude that conscientiousness and agreeableness may differ between men and women unexposed and exposed to famine during early gestation. As evidence was not very robust, future research should confirm the present findings. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Severe acute malnutrition in childhood manifests as oedematous (kwashiorkor, marasmic kwashiorkor) and non-oedematous (marasmus) syndromes with very different prognoses. Kwashiorkor differs from marasmus in the patterns of protein, amino acid and lipid metabolism when patients are acutely ill as well as after rehabilitation to ideal weight for height. Metabolic patterns among marasmic patients define them as metabolically thrifty, while kwashiorkor patients function as metabolically profligate. Such differences might underlie syndromic presentation and prognosis. However, no fundamental explanation exists for these differences in metabolism, nor clinical pictures, given similar exposures to undernutrition. We hypothesized that different developmental trajectories underlie these clinical-metabolic phenotypes: if so this would be strong evidence in support of predictive adaptation model of developmental plasticity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed the records of all children admitted with severe acute malnutrition to the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit Ward of the University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica during 1962-1992. We used Wellcome criteria to establish the diagnoses of kwashiorkor (n = 391), marasmus (n = 383), and marasmic-kwashiorkor (n = 375). We recorded participants' birth weights, as determined from maternal recall at the time of admission. Those who developed kwashiorkor had 333 g (95% confidence interval 217 to 449, p<0.001) higher mean birthweight than those who developed marasmus. Conclusions/Significance: These data are consistent with a model suggesting that plastic mechanisms operative in utero induce potential marasmics to develop with a metabolic physiology more able to adapt to postnatal undernutrition than those of higher birthweight. Given the different mortality risks of these different syndromes, this observation is supportive of the predictive adaptive response hypothesis and is the first empirical demonstration of the advantageous effects of such a response in humans. The study has implications for understanding pathways to obesity and its cardio-metabolic co-morbidities in poor countries and for famine intervention programs. © 2012 Forrester et al.},

abstract={Forest ecosystem dynamics emerges from nonlinear interactions between adaptive biotic agents (i.e., individual trees) and their relationship with a spatially and temporally heterogeneous abiotic environment. Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4% of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Humans and chimpanzees both exhibit contextdependent tool use. That is, both species choose to use tools when food is within reach, but the context is potentially hazardous. Here, we show that New Caledonian crows used tools more frequently when food was positioned next to a novel model snake than when food was positioned next to a novel teddy bear or a familiar food bowl. However, the crows showed no significant difference in their neophobic reactions towards the teddy bear and the model snake. Therefore, the crows used tools more in response to a risky object resembling a natural predator than to a less-threatening object that provoked a comparable level of neophobia. These results show that New Caledonian crows, like humans and chimpanzees, are capable of context-dependent tool use.© 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Although the brain is known to be a very plastic organ, the effects of common ecological interactions like predation or competition on brain development have remained largely unexplored. We reared nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) from two coastal marine (predation-adapted) and two isolated pond (competition-adapted) populations in a factorial experiment, manipulating perceived predatory risk and food supply to see (i) if the treatments affected brain development and (ii) if there was population differentiation in the response to treatments. We detected differences in plasticity of the bulbus olfactorius (chemosensory centre) between habitats: marine fish were not plastic, whereas pond fish had larger bulbi olfactorii in the presence of perceived predation. Marine fish had larger bulbus olfactorius overall. Irrespective of population origin, the hypothalamus was smaller in the presence of perceived predatory risk. Our results demonstrate that perceived predation risk can influence brain development, and that the effect of an environmental factor on brain development may depend on the evolutionary history of a given population in respect to this environmental factor. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The ability to examine genetically engineered mice in a chronic intravenous (IV) nicotine self-administration paradigm will be a powerful tool for investigating the contribution of specific genes to nicotine reinforcement and more importantly, to relapse behavior. Here we describe a reliable model of nicotine-taking and -seeking behavior in male C57BL/6J mice without prior operant training or food restriction. Mice were allowed to self-administer either nicotine (0.03. mg/kg/infusion) or saline in 2-h daily sessions under fixed ratio 1 (FR1) followed by FR2 schedules of reinforcement. In the nicotine group, a dose-response curve was measured after the nose-poke behavior stabilized. Subsequently, nose-poke behavior was extinguished and ability of cue presentations, priming injections of nicotine, or intermittent footshock to reinstate responding was assessed in both groups. C57BL/6J mice given access to nicotine exhibited high levels of nose-poke behavior and self-administered a high number of infusions as compared to mice given access to saline. After this acquisition phase, changing the unit-dose of nicotine resulted in a flat dose-response curve for nicotine-taking and subsequently reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior was achieved by both nicotine-associated light cue presentation and intermittent footshock. Nicotine priming injections only triggered significant reinstatement on the second consecutive day of priming. In contrast, mice previously trained to self-administer saline did not increase their responding under those conditions. These results demonstrate the ability to produce nicotine-taking and nicotine-seeking behavior in naive C57BL/6J mice without both prior operant training and food restriction. Future work will utilize these models to evaluate nicotine-taking and relapsing behavior in genetically-altered mice. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Calorie restriction (CR) is well established in the research literature to have several beneficial effects on health and has also been found to induce anxiolytic effects in the rat. Heightened levels of stress and anxiety are often regarded as key precipitating factors of relapse to substance abuse and alcohol addiction. In this study, the potential implication of a 25% CR diet in altering drug-seeking and relapse like behaviour through its capacity to influence anxiolytic-like behavioural changes was investigated. Anxiety was assessed in all rats with the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test prior to being trained to operantly self-administer either 10% ethanol, or water. Differences were found between the groups in the percentage of open arm/total arm duration and open arm/total arm entries in the EPM, demonstrating the anxiolytic effects of CR25%. Both control and CR25% groups showed preference for alcohol vs. water, however, controls responded more for alcohol during the conditioning phase than the CR25% group. Controls exhibited an alcohol deprivation-effect (ADE) post abstinence, and a cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking post extinction however the CR25% did not. These results demonstrate that the anxiolytic effects of CR25% reduces operant responding for ethanol and inhibits relapse behaviour. Taken collectively, the results of this study suggest that in line with past research a CR25% dietary regime can induce anxiolytic effects in the alcohol preferring (iP) rat. Furthermore, it also reduces the intake of ethanol and inhibits the ADE and cue-induced relapse that is characteristic of addiction in this strain. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Evidence from epidemiology suggests that developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. DVD deficiency in rats is associated with altered brain morphology and enhanced hyperlocomotion in response to MK-801 and amphetamine. The aim of this study was to determine if similar phenotypes were associated with DVD deficiency in two strains of mice (C57BL/6J, 129/X1SvJ). Brains from neonatal (P0) and adult (P70) mice were imaged using MRI and the volumes of the cerebrum, hippocampus, striatum, septum, cortex and ventricles measured, as well as the widths of white matter tracts. Locomotor sensitivity to 5. mg/kg d-amphetamine, 0.5. mg/kg MK-801 or saline was examined in a separate group of mice in an open field. DVD deficiency altered brain morphology in C57BL6/J mice, such that C57BL/6J female DVD-deficient neonatal mice had a smaller hippocampus compared to female controls. In addition, adult C57BL/6J male DVD-deficient mice had smaller lateral ventricles compared to controls, which may have been compressed by the enlarged striatum seen in these DVD-deficient mice. However, in contrast to the behavioural phenotypes found in DVD-deficient rats, there was no significant effect of maternal diet on amphetamine or MK-801-induced locomotion in either strain. These data indicate that not only species, but also strain of mouse, moderates the impact of DVD deficiency on neuroanatomical and behavioural phenotypes in rodent animal models. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recently, we have shown that mice with decreased expression of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7) in the olfactory bulb were associated with a deficit in odor discrimination compared to wild-type mice. However, it is unknown if mice with decreased α7-receptor expression also show a deficit in early odor learning preference (ELP), an enhanced behavioral response to odors with attractive value observed in rats. In this study, we modified ELP methods performed in rats and implemented similar conditions in mice. From post-natal days 5-18, wild-type mice were stroked simultaneously with an odor presentation (conditioned odor) for 90 s daily. Control mice were only stroked, exposed to odor, or neither. On the day of testing (P21), mice that were stroked in concert with a conditioned odor significantly investigated the conditioned odor compared to a novel odor, as observed similarly in rats. However, mice with a decrease in α7-receptor expression that were stroked during a conditioned odor did not show a behavioral response to that odorant. These results suggest that decreased α7-receptor expression has a role in associative learning, olfactory preference, and/or sensory processing deficits. © 2012 Hellier et al.},

abstract={The trade-off between predation risk and the need to feed is one of the major constraints animals have to cope with. Virtually all animals have a higher risk of being preyed upon when being active (e.g., searching for food or mating partners), compared with being inactive (e.g., staying at their burrows, nests, etc.). Yet, staying safe leads to a higher risk of starvation and may reduce reproductive success and body growth. Hence selection on behaviour optimizing the search, handling and digestion of food while avoiding the risk of predation is strong and should lead to strategies maximising survival chances and inclusive fitness. These facts call for integrative studies manipulating both, abundance of food and predation risk in a factorial set up, analysing the effects of both factors on behaviour and physiological parameters. We present results of a 2 × 2 factorial experiment, manipulating risk of predation and food abundance in guppies. We found that the two factors have an additive effect on body growth, but that predation risk by a pike cichlid is the main factor affecting the expression of behavioural strategies in guppies. Low food availability and high predation risk led to lower body growth. High predation risk affected swimming depth and risk sensitivity of guppies and might represent adaptive behavioural changes to the environmental context experienced in early life. Our study shows that integrative studies, analysing multiple interdependent and interconnected factors in the wild and in the lab are needed to further understand animal behaviour and development. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={Background: Recent studies have displayed increased interest in examining the relationship between personality traits and the onset, treatment response patterns, and relapse of depression. This study aimed to examine whether or not harm avoidance (HA) was a risk factor for postpartum depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the state dependency of HA. Methods: Pregnant women (n=460; mean age 31.9±4.2 years) who participated in a prenatal program completed the EPDS as a measure of depressive state and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) as a measure of HA during three periods: early pregnancy (T1), late pregnancy (around 36 weeks), and 1 month postpartum (T2). Changes in EPDS and HA scores from T1 to T2 were compared between the non depressive (ND) group and the postpartum depressive (PD) group. Results: There was no significant difference in the level of HA between the ND and PD groups at T1. In the ND group, EPDS and HA scores did not change significantly from T1 to T2. In the PD group, both scores increased significantly from T1 to T2 (EPDS, p<0.0001; HA, p<0.048). In the ND and PD groups, a significant positive correlation was observed in changes in EPDS and HA scores from T1 to T2 (r=0.31, p=0.002). Conclusions: These results suggest that HA cannot be considered a risk factor for the development of postpartum depression measured by EPDS. Furthermore, HA may be state dependent. © 2012 Furumura et al.},

abstract={Animal populations are often limited by food and rearing offspring is energetically demanding. Life history theory predicts that parents of altricial bird species will often reduce their current reproductive effort when given supplementary food. Previous food supplementation studies have mainly focused on effects on female parents, while the importance of paternal behaviour has largely been neglected. We addressed the effects of natural and experimentally increased food abundance on male ranging behaviour and provisioning rate, female and fledgling condition, and final reproductive success, in the Tengmalm's owl, . Aegolius funereus, a species with obligatory biparental care. We found that males adjusted their parental effort by reducing provisioning rate at food-supplemented nests. Food supplementation induced an increase in body mass of females, and in body mass and haematocrit levels of fledglings. This suggests that the amount of extra food provided was enough for females to increase body condition sufficiently to start allocating extra resources to enhance the quality of current offspring. While the home range size of radiomarked males was not affected by food supplementation, it decreased with cover of spruce forest, which is a habitat that is denser in structure and richer in prey than pine forest and especially clear-cut areas. This suggests that habitat-specific prey abundance and/or cover may be strong determinants of home range size for males. Overall, the results provide novel insights into how habitat quality and food supply affect male hunting behaviour and biparental care, and how this in turn is reflected in fledgling condition. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the adaptive evolution of personality, defined as inter-individual differences in behaviour that are consistent over time and across situations. For instance, the 'pace-of-life syndrome' hypothesis suggests that personality evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41% and body condition for about 20% of the total variation in latency to feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the relevance of our results in relation to the different factors influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of life-history traits and personality. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The West European hedgehog, . Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats. This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, . Meles meles) abundance. Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our results suggest that agricultural habitats may be 'landscapes of fear' for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by, among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour and species conservation. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Socioecological models assume that primates adapt their social behavior to ecological conditions, and predict that food availability and distribution, predation risk and risk of infanticide by males affect patterns of social organization, social structure and mating system of primates. However, adaptability and variation of social behavior may be constrained by conservative adaptations and by phylogenetic inertia. The comparative study of closely related species can help to identify the relative contribution of ecological and of genetic determinants to primate social systems. We compared ecological features and social behavior of two species of the genus Sapajus, S. nigritus in Carlos Botelho State Park, an area of Atlantic Forest in São Paulo state, and S. libidinosus in Fazenda Boa Vista, a semi-arid habitat in Piauí state, Brazil. S. libidinosus perceived higher predation risk and fed on clumped, high quality, and usurpable resources (fruits) all year round, whereas S. nigritus perceived lower predation risk and relied on evenly distributed, low-quality food sources (leaves) during periods of fruit shortage. As predicted by socioecology models, S. libidinosus females were philopatric and established linear and stable dominance hierarchies, coalitions, and grooming relationships. S. nigritus females competed less often, and could transfer between groups, which might explain the lack of coalitions and grooming bonds among them. Both populations presented similar group size and composition and the same polygynous mating system. The species differed from each other in accordance with differences in the characteristics of their main food sources, as predicted by socioecological models, suggesting that phylogenetic inertia does not constrain social relationships established among female Sapajus. The similarity in mating systems indicates that this element of the social system is not affected by ecological variables and thus, is a more conservative behavioral feature of the genus Sapajus. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Chemosensory discrimination of sex and other individual traits based on pheromones occurs in many reptiles. However, the use of chemoreception in turtle social behaviour is poorly known. We examined the role of chemical signals in intraspecific communication of Spanish terrapins, . Mauremys leprosa, during the breeding season. Chemical cues released by terrapins in the water might inform on sex and other individual characteristics, such as size, body condition or health state, which are important in sexual selection processes. To test this hypothesis, we compared the time spent by turtles in water pools containing chemical stimuli obtained from different conspecifics. Behavioural responses showed that turtles were able to detect and discriminate chemical cues released by conspecifics, and to modify their use of space in response to these cues alone. Males preferred water pools with chemicals of females with greater immune responses, while females preferred water pools with odours of larger males. Preferences for water used by better potential partners could increase mating opportunities with these partners, which would increase offspring fitness. Female preference for large males could also be a mechanism of protection from harassment by small males. On the other hand, males avoided water pools with chemicals of heavier, or relatively heavier, males and preferred water with chemicals of smaller, or relatively smaller, males. Chemosensory assessment of body size may allow males to minimize the risk of costly aggressive interactions with other males. Selection of water pools based on chemical cues of conspecifics may allow terrapins to optimize their mate searching while avoiding competitors. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Prey species often possess defences (e.g. toxins) coupled with warning signals (i.e. aposematism). There is growing evidence that the expression of aposematic signals often varies within species and correlates with the strength of chemical defences. This has led to the speculation that such signals may be 'honest', with signal reliability ensured by the costliness of producing or maintaining aposematic traits. We reared larval seven-spot ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata) on a Low or High aphid diet and measured the effects on warning signal expression (elytral carotenoid pigmentation, conspicuousness, spot size), levels of defensive alkaloids (precoccinelline, coccinelline), and relationships between these traits. High-diet individuals had greater total precoccinelline levels, and elytra carotenoid concentrations at adulthood which was detectable to a typical avian predator. However, larval diet did not significantly affect adult body mass or size, spot size or coccinelline levels. Elytra carotenoid concentrations correlated positively with total precoccinelline levels in both diet groups and sexes. However, the relationship between elytra carotenoid concentrations and total levels of coccinelline depended on sex: in both diet groups, elytra carotenoids and coccinelline levels were positively correlated in females, but negatively correlated in males. Spot size and coccinelline levels correlated positively in Low-diet individuals, but negatively in High-diet individuals. These results point to physiological linkages between components of aposematism, which are modulated by resource (i.e. food) availability and affect the honesty of signals. Developmental diet, but also sex, influenced the relationships between signals and toxin levels. Ladybirds are sexually size dimorphic, and thus in comparison with males, females may be more susceptible to resource limitation and more likely to be honest signallers. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={The goal of the current investigation was to develop and validate a measure to assess an individual's eating-related behaviors related to alcohol consumption, specifically behaviors intended to compensate for calories so that more alcohol could be consumed or restrict calories to enhance the psychoactive effects of alcohol consumption. Two hundred and seventy four undergraduate students (n=51 males; 75.2% Caucasian) completed a newly developed scale, the Compensatory Eating and Behaviors in Response to Alcohol Consumption Scale (CEBRACS), along with measures of eating restriction, bulimia, and body dissatisfaction. An exploratory factor analysis on the CEBRACS revealed the existence of 4 clear-cut factors: alcohol effects, bulimia, dieting and exercise, and restriction. Internal consistency statistics for all subscales ranged from .79 to .95. Pearson product-moment correlations between the CEBRACS and measures of bulimia, restriction, and body dissatisfaction ranged from .04 to .44. T-tests revealed no gender differences in compensatory eating behaviors. Future research directions and limitations of the current study are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Growing evidence has implicated glial anomalies in the pathophysiology of major depression disorder (MDD). Gap junctional communication is a main determinant of astrocytic function. However, it is unclear whether gap junction dysfunction is involved in MDD development. This study investigates changes in the function of astrocyte gap junction occurring in the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) after chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a rodent model of depression. Animals exposed to CUS and showing behavioral deficits in sucrose preference test (SPT) and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) exhibited significant decreases in diffusion of gap junction channel-permeable dye and expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), a major component of astrocyte gap junction, and abnormal gap junctional ultrastructure in the PFC. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of typical antidepressants fluoxetine and duloxetine and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone on CUS-induced gap junctional dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors. The cellular and behavioral alterations induced by CUS were reversed and/or blocked by treatment with typical antidepressants or mifepristone, indicating that the mechanism of their antidepressant action may involve the amelioration of gap junction dysfunction and the cellular changes may be related to GR activation. We then investigated the effects of pharmacological gap junction blockade in the PFC on depressive-like behaviors. The results demonstrate that carbenoxolone (CBX) infusions induced anhedonia in SPT, and anxiety in NSFT, and Cx43 mimetic peptides Gap27 and Gap26 also induced anhedonia, a core symptom of depression. Together, this study supports the hypothesis that gap junction dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of depression. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Physiological studies of neuroendocrine regulation confirm that aggressive behavior patterns are nearly universal in the animal kingdom. Different species of fish (e.g. Zebra Fish and Siamese Fighting Fish) are used as models for studies of animal behavior, including aggression. Despite an increased risk of injury or death, aggression frequently offers considerable benefits. It is mainly related with competition for limited resources, for example, competition for food or a mate, the establishment of territory and dominance hierarchies (a higher social status). Aggression is a kind of aversive drive to limit the freedom of other animals of the same or other species or to injure or kill them. Territorial behavior is a significant problem in farm and companion animals, not only causing economic losses but also threatening animal health and welfare. The following systems are involved in the regulation of aggressive behavior: the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA), sympathetico-medullary-adrenal (SAM), hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal, serotonin, somatostatin, dopamine, histamine and nitric oxide pathways, as well as brain structures responsible for motivation. The aim of this article is to review the present state of knowledge concerning the neuro-endocrine modulation of aggressive behavior in animals.},

abstract={Cats exposed to novel environments initiate stress responses by behavioral and physiological changes that modify metabolism and lead to the collection of unreliable data. Fourteen cats (10 ± 2 months) were subjected to an 11-week acclimation procedure to adapt to restriction within chambers used for indirect calorimetry studies. Cats were acclimated to chambers in their home environments, to chambers in the study room, and to increasing periods of restriction within chambers. Ten additional cats (11 ± 1 month), used as controls, were subjected to a single 5-hr restriction without any prior exposure. Stress level, feed intake, fearfulness, and eliminations were recorded. Latencies to approach a novel object peaked on Weeks 4 and 8 (p <.05). Cat-Stress-Scores (CSS) declined with exposure and on Week 11, stress levels were low and consistent (p <.05). CSS was greater in unacclimated versus acclimated cats (p <.05). In conclusion, acclimation protocols prepare cats for repeated, temporary restriction within chambers, whereas short acclimations do not. A step-up acclimation procedure with behavioral indices of stress should be utilized to prepare cats for research that necessitates restriction. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Canada geese (Branta canadensis) can cause serious damage to turfgrass areas and create human health and safety concerns (e.g., collisions with aircraft, disease transmission). We conducted a study during 2005-2007 to determine if Canada geese exhibit a feeding preference among various commercially available turfgrasses. Behavioral responses of captive geese to 9 turfgrasses, bare ground, and litter were observed over 6 4-week trials during July-September following the installation of selected turfgrasses into experimental arenas. Captive geese preferred to forage on Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bentgrass, and fine fescue sods compared to centipedegrass, St. Augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass. Forage qualities and macronutrient levels varied among the turfgrasses and might explain the foraging preferences geese exhibited during this study. Canada goose feeding rate was positively correlated with crude protein, nitrogen content, and calcium, but negatively correlated with acid detergent fiber content, within various turfgrasses. Our findings suggest careful selection of turfgrasses could be an effective method for reducing Canada goose conflicts in urban and suburban areas. Copyright © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are emitted by rodents and can signal either negative or positive affective states in social and nonsocial contexts. Our recent work has utilized selective breeding based upon the emission of 50. kHz USVs in response to standard cross species hand play-namely experimenters 'tickling' rats. Previous work has shown that high-tickle responsive animals (i.e., rats emitting abundant 50. kHz USVs) are gregarious and express enhanced positive emotional behaviors relative to animals exhibiting low 50. kHz USVs. The present study extends this work by examining the developmental profile of play behavior and the suppression of play behavior by predator (cat) odor in juvenile high-line and low-line animals. Results support dissociations in key play measures between these groups, with high-line animals emitting more dorsal contacts during play and low-line animals emitting more pinning behavior. For cat-odor induced play suppression, we found that high-line animals exhibit elevated suppression of play for a prolonged period compared to low-line rats. In contrast, low-line animals returned to normal levels of play just 1 day post-predator odor experience. These findings support the idea that emotional arousal may differ between these selectively bred groups, and extends previous work by demonstrating a possible influence of altered emotional learning and conditioning in these phenotypically different animals. One possibility is that high-line animals exhibit enhanced associative learning abilities leading to stronger negative contextual conditioning. These findings suggest that selection for positive or negative social-emotional phenotypes may also segregate genes that control emotional learning abilities in unanticipated ways. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Decision-making networks must be tuned according to the rules that govern which action will be rewarded for a given constellation of current sensory information. Somehow these rules must be implemented in the networks that translate the sensory cues to actions but the nature of this representation is enigmatic. Recent findings suggest that Mauthner-associated networks in some fish can govern surprisingly sophisticated and plastic decisions in which the rules of prey motion govern what speed and direction must be selected to be at the right point at the right time. With the key cellular players individually identifiable, fish can help us to discover the nature of how rules are represented in decision-making circuitry of the vertebrate brain. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Dietary essential fatty acids have been shown to regulate behavioral and cognitive functions in rodents. However, the long-term effect on behavior, besides memory and learning, of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), i.e., lack of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, during the perinatal period has not been investigated. Therefore, pregnant C57Bl/6 mice were given either an EFAD or an isoenergetic control diet from gestational day 16 and throughout lactation. The female offspring were given standard chow from 3 weeks of age, and at 12 to 14 weeks of age, open-field, object recognition, light-dark transition, elevated plus maze, and social interaction tests were performed. The brain glycerophospholipid fatty acid composition was investigated in 3-week-old and adult offspring by gas chromatography. The differences observed in behavior were indicative of lower anxiety in the EFAD mice compared to controls illustrated by more time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (+ 41%, p < .05) and in the light compartment in the light-dark transition test (+ 63%, p < .05). The proportion of total n-3 fatty acids, especially 22:6n-3 in the brain, was lower with a compensatory increase in the proportion of total n-6 fatty acids, foremost 22:5n-6, in the EFAD mice compared to controls at 3 weeks of age. In the adult brains the fatty acid composition was normalized. In conclusion, our data show that EFAD during the perinatal period results in short-term alterations of fatty acid composition in brain and decreased anxiety in adult life. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={We studied the effects of maternal high fat diet (HFD, 25% calories from fat administered before and during pregnancy and lactation) and dietary intervention (switching dams from HFD to control diet) at different periconceptional periods on male offspring anxiety related behavior, exploration, learning, and motivation. From weaning at postnatal day (PND) 21, female subjects produced to be the mothers in the study received either control diet (CTR - 5% calories from fat), HFD through pregnancy and lactation (MO), HFD during PNDs 21-90 followed by CTR diet (pre-gestation (PG) intervention) or HFD from PND 21 to 120 followed by CTR diet (gestation and lactation (G) intervention) and bred at PND 120. At 19 days of gestation maternal serum corticosterone was increased in MO and the PG and G dams showed partial recovery with intermediate levels. In offspring, no effects were found in the elevated plus maze test. In the open field test, MO and G offspring showed increase zone entries, displaying less thigmotaxis; PG offspring showed partial recuperation of this behavior. During initial operant conditioning MO, PG and G offspring displayed decreased approach behavior with subsequent learning impairment during the acquisition of FR-1 and FR-5 operant conditioning for sucrose reinforcement. Motivation during the progressive ratio test increased in MO offspring; PG and G intervention recuperated this behavior. We conclude that dietary intervention can reverse negative effects of maternal HFD and offspring outcomes are potentially due to elevated maternal corticosterone. © 2012 ISDN.},

abstract={Parenting behaviors are known to have a major impact on childhood obesity but it has proven difficult to isolate the specific mechanism of influence. The present study uses Baumrind's parenting typologies (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) to examine associations between parenting styles and parenting practices associated with childhood obesity. Data were collected from a diverse sample of children (n = 182, ages 7-10) in an urban school district in the United States. Parenting behaviors were assessed with the Parenting Styles and Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ), a 58-item survey that categorizes parenting practices into three styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. Parent perceptions of the home obesogenic environment were assessed with the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity (FNPA) instrument, a simple 10 item instrument that has been shown in previous research to predict risk for overweight. Cluster analyses were used to identify patterns in the PSDQ data and these clusters were related to FNPA scores and measured BMI values in children (using ANCOVA analyses that controlled for parent income and education) to examine the impact of parenting styles on risk of overweight/obesity. The FNPA score was positively (and significantly) associated with scores on the authoritative parenting scale (r = 0.29) but negatively (and significantly) associated with scores on the authoritarian scale (r = -0.22) and permissive scale (r = -0.20). Permissive parenting was significantly associated with BMIz score but this is the only dimension that exhibited a relationship with BMI. A three-cluster solution explained 40.5% of the total variance and clusters were distinguishable by low and high z-scores on different PSDQ sub-dimensions. A cluster characterized as Permissive/Authoritarian (Cluster 2) had significantly lower FNPA scores (more obesogenic) than clusters characterized as Authoritative (Cluster 1) or Authoritarian/Authoritative (Cluster 3) after controlling for family income and parent education. No direct effects of cluster were evident on the BMI outcomes but the patterns were consistent with the FNPA outcomes. The results suggest that a permissive parenting style is associated with more obesogenic environments while an authoritative parenting style is associated with less obesogenic environments. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Despite the large number of movement studies, the constraints that grouping imposes on movement decisions remain essentially unexplored, even for highly social species. Such constraints could be key, however, to understanding the dynamics and spatial organisation of species living in group fusion-fission systems. We investigated the winter movements (speed and diffusion coefficient) of groups of free-ranging roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), in an agricultural landscape characterised by a mosaic of food and foodless patches. Most groups were short-lived units that merged and split up frequently during the course of a day. Deer groups decreased their speed and diffusion rate in areas where food patches were abundant, as well as when travelling close to main roads and crest lines and far from forests. While accounting for these behavioural adjustments to habitat features, our study revealed some constraints imposed by group foraging: large groups reached the limit of their diffusion rate faster than small groups. The ability of individuals to move rapidly to new foraging locations following patch depression thus decreases with group size. Our results highlight the importance of considering both habitat heterogeneity and group dynamics when predicting the movements of individuals in group fusion-fission societies. Further, we provide empirical evidence that group cohesion can restrain movement and, therefore, the speed at which group members can explore their environment. When maintaining cohesion reduces foraging gains because of movement constraints, leaving the group may become a fitness-rewarding decision, especially when individuals can join other groups located nearby, which would tend to maintain highly dynamical group fusion-fission systems. Our findings also provide the basis for new hypotheses explaining a broad range of ecological patterns, such as the broader diet and longer residency time reported for larger herbivore groups. © 2012 Pays et al.},

abstract={The availability of food, mates, predators, and other biologically significant stimuli generally varies across both space and time. If these stimuli vary predictably, then it would be advantageous for animals to learn this spatiotemporal variability, so that they might maximally exploit these resources. The ability to learn spatiotemporal variability has become known as time-place learning (TPL). In The Organization of Learning, Gallistel (1990) put forth a theory stating that whenever a biologically significant event occurs, a memory code is formed that includes the nature of the event, as well as the time and place in which it occurred. When the animal is later faced with a biological need, it can consult these time-place-event memory codes, determine when and where that need has been met in the past, and use that information to guide its current behavior. In Gallistel's theory, animals' ability to tell time is of fundamental importance. This chapter examines this ability in rats and pigeons and considers three timing systems: ordinal timing, phase timing, and interval timing. © 2006 by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Thermoregulatory behavior and feeding status are strongly related in ectotherms. A trade-off between maintenance of energy balance and digestion efficiency has been recently proposed to affect thermoregulation in these animals. On the other hand, competition for basking sites has been described between Iberian turtles and the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). T. scripta negatively interferes with basking behavior of native turtles and benefits from a greater capacity to retain body heat, which may likely result in thermoregulatory advantages for the introduced sliders. Consequently, complex effects and alterations in metabolic rates of native turtles might derive from a deficient basking behavior. We compared the basking requirements of the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) and those of the introduced red-eared slider, analyzing the upper set point temperature (USP) (defined as the body temperature at which basking ceased) of both native and introduced turtles, under feeding and fasting conditions. We found higher values of USP in the native species, and a reduction of this temperature associated with food deprivation in the two turtle species. This adjustment of thermoregulatory behavior to the nutritional status found in freshwater turtles suggests that ectotherms benefit from metabolic depression as an adaptive mechanism to preserve energy during periods of fasting. However, a reduction in metabolic rates induced by competition with sliders might lead M. leprosa to a prolonged deficiency of their physiological functions, thus incurring increased predation risk and health costs, and ultimately favoring the recession of this native species in Mediterranean habitats. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The issues of food quality and food quantity are crucial for trophic interactions. Although most research has focussed on the primary producer - herbivore link, recent studies have shown that quality effects at the bottom of the food web propagate to higher trophic levels. Negative effects of poor food quality have almost exclusively been demonstrated at higher food quantities. Whether these negative effects have the same impact at low food availability in situations where the majority if not all of the resources are channelled into routine metabolism, is under debate. In this study a tri-trophic food chain was designed, consisting of the algae Rhodomonas salina, the copepod Acartia tonsa and freshly hatched larvae of the European lobster Homarus gammarus. The lobster larvae were presented with food of two different qualities (C:P ratios) and four different quantities to investigate the combined effects of food quality and quantity. Our results show that the quality of food has an impact on the condition of lobster larvae even at very low food quantities. Food with a lower C:P content resulted in higher condition of the lobster larvae regardless of the quantity of food. These interacting effects of food quality and food quantity can have far reaching consequences for ecosystem productivity. © 2012 Schoo et al.},

abstract={Larvae of marine invertebrates may vertically position themselves in locations where conditions favor growth, development, and survival. Areas in stratified water columns with favorable salinities, concentrated food, or low predation may increase the probability for larvae to reach settlement. We examined the vertical distribution of three developmental stages of the echinoid Dendraster excentricus in response to haloclines, food cues, and predator cues in laboratory microcosms. Embryos, 4-arm plutei, and 8-arm plutei responded similarly to haloclines by swimming upward through haloclines when the bottom layer was at salinity 31 (ambient) and the top layer was at 27 or 23. The centers of larval mass for all stages were near the halocline when the top layer was at salinity 19 or 15. We tested the tolerance of each stage to prolonged exposure to each of these salinities and found sublethal effects under salinity 23, suggesting costs for concentrating in low salinity environments. To test the response of 4-arm larvae to food patches, we constructed a food layer composed of cells or supernatant of one of three species of algae (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Isocrysis galbana, Rhodomonas sp.). The larvae distributed above the food layer in the presence of two algal species, D. tertiolecta and Rhodomonas sp., but distributions were similar to controls when I. galbana was tested. Finally, larvae significantly changed their distributions in response to cues from a potential predator (juvenile perch), showing an avoidance behavior. The observed larval behaviors in response to haloclines, algae, and a potential predator suggest that D. excentricus plutei behaviorally respond to their environment and likely change position in response to environmental cues in the field. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid Hemimysis anomala (hereafter Hemimysis) was first observed in south-eastern Lake Ontario in May 2006. In Lake Ontario, Hemimysis is most abundant at nearshore habitats characterised by cobble-rubble substrate, which it shares with the round goby Neogobius melanostomus (hereafter goby). To better understand the interaction if any between gobies and Hemimysis, gobies were collected throughout the summer and fall periods at three shallow (< 3. m) nearshore locations representing eastern, central, and western Lake Ontario where Hemimysis are relatively abundant. Goby stomach contents were examined for evidence of Hemimysis and other prey. In addition, gobies were collected at two locations in southwestern Lake Ontario in shallow- (3. m) and deep- (11. m) water nearshore habitat where stomach contents were also used to characterise diet. Despite higher Hemimysis abundance nearshore, Hemimysis were not consumed by any gobies collected from shallow nearshore locations, and only found in three of 23 gobies collected at the deep site. Goby abundance and consumption of Hemimysis by gobies at the deep site were unrelated to Hemimysis abundance in traps. At all locations, gobies fed on soft-bodied invertebrates and dreissenids although dreissenids were the dominant prey among large (> 74. mm) gobies. We suspect that the ability of Hemimysis to avoid predation by gobies is the result of a combination of anti-predator behaviours such as an evasive startle response, reduced activity and depth dependent segregation in interstitial spaces during the day, and a feeding mode used by gobies that is poorly suited for an evasive species like Hemimysis. © 2012.},

abstract={The ultimate survival of humanity is dependent upon colonization of other planetary bodies. Key challenges to such habitation are (patho)physiologic changes induced by known, and unknown, factors associated with long-duration and distance space exploration. However, we currently lack biological models for detecting and studying these changes. Here, we use a remote automated culture system to successfully grow an animal in low Earth orbit for six months. Our observations, over 12 generations, demonstrate that the multi-cellular soil worm Caenorhabditis elegans develops from egg to adulthood and produces progeny with identical timings in space as on the Earth. Additionally, these animals display normal rates of movement when fully fed, comparable declines in movement when starved, and appropriate growth arrest upon starvation and recovery upon re-feeding. These observations establish C. elegans as a biological model that can be used to detect changes in animal growth, development, reproduction and behaviour in response to environmental conditions during long-duration spaceflight. This experimental system is ready to be incorporated on future, unmanned interplanetary missions and could be used to study cost-effectively the effects of such missions on these biological processes and the efficacy of new life support systems and radiation shielding technologies. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={In an attempt to establish a relationship between food intake and fear/anxiety-related behaviours, the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of bilateral injections of GABAA (Muscimol, MUS, doses 25 and 50 ng/side) and GABAB (Baclofen, BAC, doses 32 and 64 ng/side) receptor agonists in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) on the level of fear/anxiety-like and feeding behaviours in 24 h food-deprived rats. The antagonists of GABAA (Bicuculline, BIC, doses 75 and 150 ng/side) and GABAB (Saclofen, SAC, doses 1.5 and 3 μg/side) were also tested. The results indicated that the total number of risk assessment behaviour decreased after the injection of both doses of GABAA agonist (MUS) into the AcbSh of 24 h food-deprived rats exposed to elevated plus maze. Similar results were obtained after treatment with both doses of GABAB (BAC) agonist in the AcbSh. These data indicated that the activation of both GABAA and GABAB receptors within the AcbSh caused anxiolysis in 24 h food-deprived rats. In addition, feeding behaviour (food intake, feeding latency and feeding duration) remained unchanged after treatment with both GABA agonists. In contrast, both food intake and feeding duration decreased after injections of both doses of BIC (GABAA antagonist), while the feeding latency remained unchanged after treatment with both GABA antagonists in the AcbSh of 24 h food-deprived rats. The treatment with SAC (GABAB antagonist) did not affect feeding behaviour. Collectively, these data suggest that emotional changes evoked by pharmacological manipulation of the GABA neurotransmission in the AcbSh are not linked with changes in food intake. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Animals constantly need to cope with changes in their environment. Coping with changes in cues that are associated with the location and abundance of food is essential for being able to adjust behaviourally to a variable environment. The use of cues in decision making requires appropriate levels of attention and learning ability, which may be affected by the personality of an individual. The relationship between personality, attention and learning as essential mechanisms for behavioural adaptation, however, is not well understood. We studied the relationship between attention to environmental cues, behavioural flexibility in learning and exploratory behaviour, a proxy for personality, in great tits, Parus major. We used a dimensional shift learning paradigm; a learning task involving several stages differing in complexity and requiring attention to changes in relevant cues. The results show personality differences in performance in learning flexibility in only the apparently most difficult stage, yet in opposite directions for males and females. Fast-exploring males showed more flexible learning abilities than slow males, whereas in females slow explorers outperformed fast explorers. These context-dependent and sex-specific personality effects reveal behavioural and cognitive mechanisms that may underlie observed sex- and personality-dependent fitness differences in natural populations. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Anthropogenic food patches in the marine environment, such as aquaculture farms and active trawlers, may impact on the behavior of marine mammals through modification of habitats, changes in predation pressure, or alterations in food distribution, availability, and predictability, affecting related social interactions and population demographics. This study examined patterns of association of a population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) around Lampedusa Island (Italy) during 1996-2006 and tested the hypothesis that the trawl fishery and the presence of an aquaculture farm could affect such patterns. Here, we used measures of association between pairs of individuals to assess this impact on social unit composition/cohesion and some analytical techniques to describe the structure of dolphin social networks and temporal stability of associations. Association information for 71 regularly sighted individuals was obtained from photo-identification surveys within groups observed or not at "feeding stations." We found association patterns between dolphins were nonrandom. The Lampedusa population seems to be arranged into 6 clusters and organized in communities composed of animals that were either never seen in association with feeding stations (N individuals) or those that are (Y individuals), although mixed assemblages were also recorded. Both communities showed long-term preferred companions, with different degrees of social cohesion - as resulted by network measures and temporal analysis. Delineating community structure at Lampedusa Island has offered basic information for further investigations in the area, also providing novel evidences on how disparities in association patterns between bottlenose dolphin individuals may have resulted from a combination of ecological and anthropogenic factors. © The Author 2011.},

abstract={Strategies to reduce risk of obesity by influencing preschool children's eating behaviour are reviewed. The studies are placed in the context of relevant psychological processes, including inherited and acquired preferences, and behavioural traits, such as food neophobia, 'enjoyment of food' and 'satiety responsiveness'. These are important influences on how children respond to feeding practices, as well as predictors of obesity risk. Nevertheless, in young children, food environment and experience are especially important for establishing eating habits and food preferences. Providing information to parents, or to children, on healthy feeding is insufficient. Acceptance of healthy foods can be encouraged by five to ten repeated tastes. Recent evidence suggests rewarding healthy eating can be successful, even for verbal praise alone, but that palatable foods should not be used as rewards for eating. Intake of healthier foods can be promoted by increasing portion size, especially in the beginning of the meal. Parental strategies of pressuring to eat and restriction do not appear to be causally linked to obesity, but are instead primarily responses to children's eating tendencies and weight. Moderate rather than frequent restriction may improve healthy eating in children. Actively positive social modelling by adults and peers can be effective in encouraging healthier eating. © 2012 The Authors. obesity reviews © 2012 International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract={Despite the spread of human-impacted wildlife habitats, few studies have examined how animals adapt their socioecology in agricultural-forest ecotones. Anthropogenic processes such as agricultural development directly affect the ecological challenges that species face. In agricultural-forest ecotones cultivated foods that are palatable, energy-rich, easily digestible, and that often occur as large, clumped and spatially abundant orchards or fields may offer foraging advantages over natural foods. However, crop raiding can be risky: harassment, injury or even death may arise from confrontations with people. The factors that affect grouping decisions and activity budgets within anthropogenic environments are unknown. Twelve months of focal data were collected from direct observations of one chimpanzee community inhabiting a forest-farm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea. Wild fruit abundance did not directly influence daily party size. Instead, cultivated resource consumption, in combination with other social factors, provided chimpanzees with an alternative to fissioning. Chimpanzee party size did not differ between crop raids and wild feeds, but party cohesiveness did increase during raids. Furthermore, males and females adapted their activity budgets in different ways to integrate cultivated resources into their broader ecological strategy. As species are increasingly forced into anthropogenically impacted habitats, models of fission-fusion dynamics and other socioecological adaptations need to take into account exploitation of cultivated, energy-rich crops. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Sugars and fats elicit innate and learned flavor preferences with the latter mediated by flavor-flavor (orosensory) and flavor-nutrient (post-ingestive) processes. Systemic dopamine (DA) D1 (SCH23390: SCH) and D2 (raclopride: RAC), but not opioid antagonists blocked the acquisition and expression of flavor-flavor preferences conditioned by sugars. In addition, systemic D1, but not D2 or opioid antagonists blocked the acquisition of flavor-nutrient preferences conditioned by intragastric (IG) sugar infusions. Given that DA antagonists reduce fat intake, the present study examined whether systemic D1 or D2 antagonists altered the acquisition and/or expression of conditioned flavor preferences (CFP) produced by pairing one novel flavor (CS+, e.g., cherry) with a 3.5% corn oil (CO: fat) solution relative to another flavor (CS-, e.g., grape) paired with a 0.9% CO solution. In an expression study, food-restricted rats were trained to drink either flavored 3.5% or 0.9% CO solutions on alternate days. Subsequent two-bottle tests with the CS+ and CS- flavors mixed in 0.9% CO solutions occurred 0.5. h after systemic administration of vehicle (VEH), SCH (50-800. nmol/kg) or RAC (50-800. nmol/kg). The rats displayed a robust CS+ preference following VEH treatment (87-88%) the expression of which was attenuated by treatment with moderate doses of RAC, and to a lesser degree, SCH. In an acquisition study, six groups of rats received VEH, SCH (25, 50, 200. nmol/kg) or RAC (50, 200. nmol/kg) 0.5. h prior to 1-bottle training trials with CS+ flavored 3.5% and CS- flavored 0.9% (CS-) CO solutions. A seventh Limited VEH group was trained with its training intakes limited to that of the SCH and RAC groups. Subsequent two-bottle tests were conducted with the CS+ and CS- flavors presented in 0.9% CO without injections. Significant and persistent CS+ preferences were observed in VEH (75-82%), Limited VEH (70-88%), SCH25 (75-84%), SCH50 (64-87%), SCH200 (78-91%) and RAC200 (74-91%) groups. In contrast, the group trained with RAC50 displayed a significant initial CS+ preference (76%) which declined over testing to 61%. These data indicate limited DA D1 and D2 receptor signaling involvement in the expression and acquisition of a fat-CFP relative to previous robust effects for sugar-CFP. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Shrimp were observed under laboratory conditions during 12 h light-12 h dark cycles, before and immediately after feeding. The behaviors recorded were: burrowing, substrate exploration, vertical exploration, ingestion, swimming, inactivity, and crawling. The frequencies of all these behaviors increased in the presence of food, independent of time or light phase. The consumption of feed was more frequent in the morning. The results showed that the rhythm of activity is influenced by the light-dark cycle and the availability of food. The results are different from those reported for other shrimp species and indicate the potential value of understanding the behavioral details of each species for optimizing their management. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We review the population dynamics of red-backed voles (Myodes species) in North America, the main deciduous and coniferous forest-dwelling microtines on this continent, and compare and contrast their pattern with that of the same or similar species in Eurasia. We identify 7 long-term studies of population changes in Myodes in North America. Using autoregressive and spectral analysis, we found that only 2 of the 7 show 3- to 5-year cycles like those found in some Eurasian populations. There was no relationship between latitude and cycling. The general lack of cyclicity is associated with two key aspects of their demography that act in tandem: first, poor overwinter survival in most years; second, chronically low densities, with irregular outbreak years. Eight factors might explain why some Myodes populations fluctuate in cycles and others fluctuate irregularly, and we review the evidence for each factor: food supplies, nutrients, predation, interspecific competition, disease, weather, spacing behavior and interactive effects. Of these eight, only food supplies appear to be sufficient to explain the differences between cyclic and non-cyclic populations. Irregular fluctuations are the result of pulsed food supplies in the form of berry crops (M. rutilus) or tree seeds (M. gapperi) linked to weather patterns. We argue that, to understand the cause for the patterns in the respective hemispheres, we must know the mechanism(s) driving population change and this must be linked to rigorous field tests. We suggest that a large-scale, year-round feeding experiment should improve overwintering survival, increase standing densities, and flip non-cyclic Myodes populations into cyclic dynamics that would mimic the patterns seen in the cyclic populations found in parts of Eurasia. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Running wheels are commonly employed to measure rodent physical activity in a variety of contexts, including studies of energy balance and obesity. There is no consensus on the nature of wheel-running activity or its underlying causes, however. Here, we will begin by systematically reviewing how running wheel availability affects physical activity and other aspects of energy balance in laboratory rodents. While wheel running and physical activity in the absence of a wheel commonly correlate in a general sense, in many specific aspects the two do not correspond. In fact, the presence of running wheels alters several aspects of energy balance, including body weight and composition, food intake, and energy expenditure of activity. We contend that wheel-running activity should be considered a behavior in and of itself, reflecting several underlying behavioral processes in addition to a rodent's general, spontaneous activity. These behavioral processes include defensive behavior, predatory aggression, and depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. As it relates to energy balance, wheel running engages several brain systems-including those related to the stress response, mood, and reward, and those responsive to growth factors-that influence energy balance indirectly. We contend that wheel-running behavior represents factors in addition to rodents' tendency to be physically active, engaging additional neural and physiological mechanisms which can then independently alter energy balance and behavior. Given the impact of wheel-running behavior on numerous overlapping systems that influence behavior and physiology, this review outlines the need for careful design and interpretation of studies that utilize running wheels as a means for exercise or as a measurement of general physical activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In structured populations, phenotypic change can result from changes throughout an individual's lifetime (phenotypic plasticity, age-related changes), selection and changes in population composition (environment- or density-driven fluctuations in age-structure). The contribution of population dynamics to phenotypic change has often been ignored. However, for understanding trait dynamics, it is important to identify both the individual- and population-level mechanisms responsible for trait change, because they potentially reinforce or counteract each other. We use 22years of field data to investigate the dynamics of a sexually selected phenological trait, the timing of nuptial moult in superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus. We show that trait expression is both climate- and age-dependent, but that phenotypic plasticity in response to climate variability also varies with age. Old males can acquire nuptial plumage very early after high rainfall, but 1- to 2-year-olds cannot. However, males of all ages that defer moult to later in the year acquire nuptial plumage earlier when conditions are warmer. The underlying mechanism appears to be that old males may risk moulting in the most challenging period of the year: in autumn, when drought restricts food abundance and during the cold winter. By contrast, young males always moult during the spring transition to benign - warmer and generally wetter - conditions. Temperature changes dominate this transition that heralds the breeding season, thereby causing both young and late-moulting older birds to be temperature sensitive. Climate and age also affect trait dynamics via a population dynamical pathway. The same high rainfall that triggers early moulting in old males concurrently increases offspring recruitment and thereby reduces the average age of males in the population. Consequently, effects of rainfall on trait dynamics through phenotypic plasticity of old males are dampened by synchronous rejuvenation of the age-structure. A long-term trend towards drier environments prompted phenotypic change because of plasticity, but this was masked by climate-driven demographic change (causing apparent stasis). This suggests a novel explanation for why trait change may fail to reflect the observed pattern of directional selection or phenotypic plasticity. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Several reinforcement-based models have been proposed to explain transitive-like behavior in nonverbal transitive inference tasks. These models assume that the initial training required for memorizing the premises produces an ordered series of associative values (A. > B > C. > D > E); these values can then be used to select the " transitively correct" stimulus in a novel pair (e.g., BD). Our study experimentally tested this assumption by using resistance-to-extinction and resistance-to-reinforcement techniques to obtain empirical measures of associative strength for Stimuli B and D. We first measured the associative strengths of these stimuli after completion of initial training with overlapping pairs of colored squares (A. +. B-, B. +. C-, C. +. D-, and D. +. E-) using resistance-to-extinction and resistance-to-reinforcement procedures. Next, we used massed presentations of Pair D. +. E- (termed bias reversal) that ought to increase the associative value of Stimulus D, and again measured the associative strengths of the stimuli. None of our experimental measures of associative strength correlated with pigeons' behavior in the BD test or with BD performance predicted by associative models either before or after bias reversal (Wynne, 1995; Siemann and Delius, 1998). These results question validity of reinforcement-based models for explaining animals' behavior in nonverbal TI tasks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a "shyness-boldness" continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known about how this personality trait might influence individual predation risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals. These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior. Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity, suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context, potentially removing these differences. © The Author 2011.},

abstract={The Bovine Rrespiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) in calves causes substantial economical losses due to treatment costs, loss of animals, growth retardation and diminished carcass quality. BR-DC is a multifactorial disease, which is elicited by interactions between the host and a number of risk factors, among these viruses and bacteria as well as environmental factors (clitnatic conditions, hygiene, management at calving, nutrition, dehorning commingling, and transportation). The usage of antibiotics in the metaphylaxis and treatment of BRDC is a widespread routine. The need to reduce the number of antimicrobial treatments in food producing animals demands to intensify the advisory work in order to gain a reduction in the number of risk factors («stressors» ) that contribute to the occurrence of BRDC in calves. To this end, a number of guidelines, checklists and monitoring protocols for evaluation of the health status and the environmental conditions as well as animal behaviour are available, but are not used on a routine basis in bovine practice. Advisory work should aim at reducing the intensity of exposition as well as the number of risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of BRDC. Daily observations are needed to identify, examine and treat affected animals in the initial phase of BRDC in order to avoid irreversible alterations of the lung.},

abstract={After several political conflicts and tensions of the six and a half-decade history of independent India the demand for the creation of the ombudsman institution came into the foreground in 2011, in the interest of pushing back corruption. The institution itself had not been unknown but no comprehensive law, extending over the entire country has stipulated its operation and competencies. In 2011, however, the government had a bill elaborated which has provoked broad-based protest movements, and the community of independent people, based on a novel civil unity has elaborated a counter-draft which was not accepted by the government. Bargaining started and though the draft was to be passed by parliament it has not been done for the time being. The discussion was mostly focused on the competencies and authorisations of the ombudsman, and about what those offices and positions were the activities of which would be excluded by the investigations of the future ombudsman. The movement, which consisted of legal experts, former judges and other prominent independent personalities could find a person "coming from among the people" who could organise this political struggle into a real mass movement, and exercised pressure on the process of negotiations and on the government with methods well known in India. This brief survey dedicates quite some space to his political background and methods, and also deals with the phenomenon of how a political personality of modest schooling has been integrated into the activities of a relatively novel modern civil movement in India.},

abstract={Voluntary wheel running (WR) is a form of physical activity in rodents that influences ingestive behavior. The present report describes an anorexic behavior triggered by the simultaneous introduction of a novel diet and WR. This study examined the sequential, compared with the simultaneous, introduction of a novel high-fat (HF) diet and voluntary WR in rats of three different ages and revealed a surprising finding; the simultaneous introduction of HF food and voluntary WR induced a behavior in which the animals chose not to eat although food was available at all times. This phenomenon was apparently not due to an aversion to the novel HF diet because introduction of the running wheels plus the HF diet, while continuing the availability of the normal chow diet did not prevent the anorexia. Moreover, the anorexia was prevented with prior exposure to the HF diet. In addition, the anorexia was not related to extent of WR but dependent on the act of WR. The introduction a HF diet and locked running wheels did not induce the anorexia. This voluntary anorexia was accompanied by substantial weight loss, and the anorexia was rapidly reversed by removal of the running wheels. Moreover, the HF/WR-induced anorexia is preserved across the age span despite the intrinsic decrease in WR activity and increased consumption of HF food with advancing age. The described phenomenon provides a new model to investigate anorexia behavior in rodents. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The role of behavioural flexibility in responding to new or changing environmental challenges is a central theme in cognitive ecology. Studies of behavioural flexibility have focused mostly on mammals and birds because theory predicts that behavioural flexibility is favoured in species or clades that exploit a diversity of habitats or food sources and/or have complex social structure, attributes not associated with ectothermic vertebrates. Here, we present the results of a series of experiments designed to test cognitive abilities across multiple cognitive modules in a tropical arboreal lizard: Anolis evermanni. This lizard shows behavioural flexibility across multiple cognitive tasks, including solving a novel motor task using multiple strategies and reversal learning, as well as rapid associative learning. This flexibility was unexpected because lizards are commonly believed to have limited cognitive abilities and highly stereotyped behaviour. Our findings indicate that the cognitive abilities of A. evermanni are comparable with those of some endothermic species that are recognized to be highly flexible, and strongly suggest a re-thinking of our understanding of the cognitive abilities of ectothermic tetrapods and of the factors favouring the evolution of behavioural flexibility. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Models explaining behavioural syndromes often focus on state-dependency, linking behavioural variation to individual differences in other phenotypic features. Empirical studies are, however, rare. Here, we tested for a size and growth-dependent stable behavioural syndrome in the juvenile-stages of a solitary apex predator (pike, Esox lucius), shown as repeatable foraging behaviour across risk. Pike swimming activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact with a competitor or predator. Foraging behaviour across risks was considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation. However, individual behaviour was independent of body size and growth in conditions of high food availability, showing no evidence to support the state-dependent personality hypothesis. The importance of a combination of spatial and temporal environmental variation for generating growth differences is highlighted. © 2012 Nyqvist et al.},

abstract={Developmental programming resulting from a suboptimal intrauterine environment can predispose offspring to a wide-range of lifelong health complications. Little is known about the effects maternal protein restriction during pregnancy and/or lactation has on offspring neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that maternal isocaloric low protein diet during pregnancy and/or lactation would negatively influence male offspring affect and risk assessment behaviors as measured by elevated plus maze and open field tests. Control mothers received 20% casein (C) and restricted mothers (R) 10% casein to provide four groups: CC, RR, CR, and RC (first letter pregnancy diet and second letter lactation diet) to evaluate effects of maternal diet on offspring risk assessment, anxiety and exploratory behaviors. Elevated plus maze results showed an effect of pre- and/or postnatal diet manipulation in open arm time (p< 0.05) with increases seen in the RR (157±22.7. s), CR (137±23.2. s) and RC (146.8±10.8. s) offspring relative to CC (52±8.6. s) offspring. This behavior indicates decreased avoidance (less anxiety) and increased exploration by experimental groups. However, in the open field test the RR (17±4.2 entries) offspring entered the center zone less than the CC (35±6.6 entries) offspring thus exhibiting increased anxiety with no other groups showing effects. Elevated levels of corticosterone were measured before, during and after immobilization in the RR compared to CC offspring. These findings show protein restriction during critical periods of development negatively program offspring behavior. The underlying anatomical structures affected remain to be elucidated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

Female C57BL/6 mice, previously screened for neophobia, had free access to enriched cages connected to their standard cages. The relative consumption of food in each cage revealed approximate dwelling times; the use of two enrichments was also measured. High neophobia significantly predicted reduced use of the enriched cage. Thus even within this homogeneous population, provided with identical enrichments, differential neophobia predicted differential enrichment use. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={The currently rising sea temperatures are expected to affect the structure of aquatic communities. Through increased metabolic rates, activity and feeding motivation, higher temperature can be expected to add to competition and predation risk for many small fish and juveniles. However, behavioural flexibility e.g. individual variation in the expression of behavioural traits may act to buffer the detrimental effects of increased temperature. In the present study we ask how juvenile Atlantic cod respond to food availability and predation risk at the limits of their current natural temperature at the Icelandic coast (3°C-13°C). At 13°C Atlantic cod juveniles responded less to risk, remaining active, dispersed and leaving shelter positions earlier. However, at the same time their feeding attempts reduce significantly and correspondingly to the lower temperature. Therefore, our results suggest that at 13°C Atlantic cod juveniles do not adjust their behaviour to manage the increased feeding motivation while under risk. However, we do find evidence for individual variation in how behaviour is expressed across treatments indicating natural variation that could respond to selection. In conclusion, our results suggest that increased sea temperature could have both immediate negative effects on survival and initiate a selective response in Atlantic cod populations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A major challenge of biology is understanding the relationship between molecular genetic variation and variation in quantitative traits, including fitness. This relationship determines our ability to predict phenotypes from genotypes and to understand how evolutionary forces shape variation within and between species. Previous efforts to dissect the genotype-phenotype map were based on incomplete genotypic information. Here, we describe the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a community resource for analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits. The DGRP consists of fully sequenced inbred lines derived from a natural population. Population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism in centromeric autosomal regions and the X chromosome, evidence for positive and negative selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. Many variants in novel genes, most at low frequency, are associated with quantitative traits and explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance. The DGRP facilitates genotype-phenotype mapping using the power of Drosophila genetics. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Animals housed with running wheels and subjected to daily food restriction show paradoxical reductions in food intake and increases in running wheel activity. This phenomenon, known as activity-based anorexia (ABA), leads to marked reductions in body weight that can ultimately lead to death. Recently, ABA has been proposed as a model of anorexia nervosa (AN). AN affects about 8 per 100,000 females and has the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric illnesses. Given the reductions in quality of life, high mortality rate, and the lack of pharmacological treatments for AN, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying AN-like behavior is greatly needed. This chapter provides basic guidelines for conducting ABA experiments using mice. The ABA mouse model provides an important tool for investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of AN-like behavior and identifying novel treatments. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Maternal protein deficiencies can developmentally program offspring to lifelong dysfunction of many physiological systems. We hypothesized that maternal isocaloric low protein diet during fetal and early postnatal development would negatively affect female offspring anxiety, exploration, associative learning and motivation as measured by the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), operant conditioning and the progressive ratio task, respectively. Control mothers (C) received a 20% casein diet and restricted mothers (R) a 10% casein diet to provide four groups: CC, RR, CR, and RC (first letter pregnancy diet and second lactation diet) to enable evaluation of offspring effects influenced by maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation. Maternal protein restriction decreased open arm time and distance in RR and RC offspring, increased anxiety behavior, in the EPM. In the OFT, the RR and RC offspring displayed decreased exploration (increased stress) as indexed by decreased distance in the center zone. These behaviors in the EPM and OFT was associated with increased corticosterone levels during an immobilization test in the RR offspring with intermediary effects in the RC offspring. Learning impairment was observed in the RR, CR and RC offspring during fixed ratio 5 schedule of reinforcement. Motivational effects were measured in RR offspring responding less, decreased motivation, and CR offspring making more responses, increased motivation, than CC offspring. These findings reveal the negative effects of developmental protein restriction on female offspring behavior. The underlying basis for these negative outcomes remains to be elucidated. © 2011 ISDN.},

abstract={Previous research has suggested that vegetarianism may serve as a mask for restrained eating. The purpose of this study was to compare the dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors of vegetarians (n= 55), pesco-vegetarians (n= 28), semi-vegetarians (n= 29), and flexitarians (n= 37), to omnivores (n= 91), who do not restrict animal products from their diets. A convenience sample of college-age females completed questionnaires about their eating habits, food choice motivations, and personality characteristics. Results indicated that while vegetarians and pesco-vegetarians were more open to new experiences and less food neophobic, they were not more restrained than omnivores. Rather semi-vegetarians; those who restricted only red meat from their diet, and flexitarians; those who occasionally eat red meat, were significantly more restrained than omnivores. Whereas food choices of semi-vegetarians and flexitarians were motivated by weight control, vegetarians and pesco-vegetarians' food choices were motivated by ethical concerns. By focusing specifically on semi-vegetarian and flexitarian subgroups, more effective approaches can be developed to ensure that their concerns about weight loss do not lead to unhealthful or disordered eating patterns. © 2011.},

abstract={There is a need for refinement of the current behavioral phenotyping methods for mouse models of genetic disorders. The current approach is to perform a behavioral screen using standardized tasks to define a broad phenotype of the model. This phenotype is then compared to what is known concerning the disorder being modeled. The weakness inherent in this approach is twofold: First, the tasks that make up these standard behavioral screens do not model specific behaviors associated with a given genetic mutation but rather phenotypes affected in various genetic disorders; secondly, these behavioral tasks are insufficiently sensitive to identify subtle phenotypes. An alternate phenotyping strategy is to determine the core behavioral phenotypes of the genetic disorder being studied and develop behavioral tasks to evaluate specific hypotheses concerning the behavioral consequences of the genetic mutation. This approach emphasizes direct comparisons between the mouse and human that facilitate the development of neurobehavioral biomarkers or quantitative outcome measures for studies of genetic disorders across species. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A good understanding of mammalian societies requires measuring patterns and comprehending processes of dispersal in each sex. We investigated dispersal behaviour in arvicoline rodents, a subfamily of mammals widespread in northern temperate environments and characterized by a multivoltine life cycle. In arvicoline rodents, variation in life history strategies occurs along a continuum from precocial to delayed maturation that reflects seasonal and ecological fluctuations. We compared dispersal across and within species focusing on the effects of external (condition-dependent) and internal (phenotype-dependent) factors. Our data revealed substantial, unexplained variation between species for dispersal distances and a strong variation within species for both dispersal distance and fraction. Some methodological aspects explained variation across studies, which cautions against comparisons that do not control for them. Overall, the species under consideration display frequent short-distance dispersal events and extremely flexible dispersal strategies, but they also have hitherto unexpected capacity to disperse long distances. Female arvicolines are predominantly philopatric relative to males, but we found no clear association between the mating system and the degree of sex bias in dispersal across species. Dispersal is a response to both various proximate and ultimate factors, including competition, inbreeding avoidance, mate searching and habitat quality. In particular, our review suggests that costs and benefits experienced during transience and settlement are prime determinants of condition dependence. Patterns of phenotype-dependent dispersal are idiosyncratic, except for a widespread association between an exploration/activity syndrome and natal dispersal. Consequences for population dynamics and genetic structures are discussed. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Observations that humans and other species are sensitive to variability in the outcome of their choices has led to the widespread assumption that this sensitivity reflects adaptations to cope with risk (stochasticity of action consequences). We question this assumption in experiments with starlings. We show that choices between outcomes that are risky in both amount and delay to food are predictable from preferences in the absence of risk. We find that the overarching best predictor of an option's value is the average of the ratios of amount to delay across its (frequency weighted) outcomes, an expression known as " Expectation of the Ratios" , or EoR. Most tests of risk sensitivity focus on the predicted impact of energetic state on preference for risk. We show instead that under controlled state conditions subjects are variance- and risk-neutral with respect to EoR, and this implies variance neutrality for amounts and variance-proneness for delays. The weak risk aversion for amounts often reported requires a small modification of EoR. EoR is consistent with associative learning: acquisition of value for initially neutral stimuli is roughly proportional to the magnitude of their consequences and inversely proportional to the interval between the stimulus and its consequence's onset. If, as is likely, the effect of amount on acquisition is sublinear, the result is a deviation from EoR towards risk aversion for amount. In 3 experiments, we first establish individual birds' preferences between pairs of fixed options that differ in both amount and delay (small-sooner vs. large-later), and then examine choices between stochastic mixtures that include these options. Experiment 1 uses a titration to establish certainty equivalents, while experiments 2 and 3 measure degree of preference between options with static parameters. The mixtures differ in the coefficient of variation of amount, delay, or both, but EoR is sufficient to predict all results, with no additional explanatory role for riskiness. © 2011.},

This work aims to review a selection of studies in the field, focusing on three key factors, related to demand feeding and fish welfare. Firstly, we outline how demand feeders should be considered when developing feed management strategies for improving welfare in production conditions. Secondly, via laboratory demand-feeding experiments, we show self-feeding activities depend not only on feeding motivation and social organisation, but also on individual learning capacity and risk-taking behaviour. Thirdly, we report encouraging results demonstrating that when presented with two or more self-feeders containing complementary foods, fish select a diet according to their specific nutritional requirements, suggesting that demand feeders could be used to improve welfare by allowing fish to meet their nutritional needs. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Osteoporosis is a major public health problem due to consequent fragility fractures; data from the UK suggest that up to 50% of women and 20% men aged 50 years will have an osteoporosis-related fracture in their remaining lifetime. Skeletal size and density increase from early embryogenesis through intrauterine, infant, childhood and adult life to reach a peak in the third to fourth decade. The peak bone mass achieved is a strong predictor of later osteoporosis risk. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between early growth and later bone mass, both at peak and in later life, and also with reduced risk of hip fracture. Mother-offspring cohorts have allowed the elucidation of some of the specific factors in early life, such as maternal body build, lifestyle and 25(OH)-vitamin D status, which might be important. Most recently, the phenomenon of developmental plasticity, whereby a single genotype may give rise to different phenotypes depending on the prevailing environment, and the science of epigenetics have presented novel molecular mechanisms which may underlie previous observations. This review will give an overview of these latter developments in the context of the burden of osteoporosis and the wider data supporting the link between the early environment and bone health in later life. © 2011 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.},

abstract={Epigenetic processes which include DNA methylation, histone modification and miRNAs are integral in determining when and where specific genes are expressed. There is now increasing evidence that the epigenome is susceptible to a variety of environmental cues, such as nutrition, during specific periods of development. The changes induced by early-life nutrition may reflect an adaptive response of the foetus to environmental cues acting through the process of developmental plasticity. This may allow an organism to adjust its developmental programme resulting in long-term changes in its metabolism and physiology in order to be better matched to the future environment. However, when the future environment lies outside the anticipated range, metabolic and homoeostatic capacity will be mismatched with the environment and that individual will be at increased risk of developing a range of non-communicable diseases. Thus the environmental regulation of epigenetic processes is a central component in the developmental origins of non-communicable diseases and our understanding of these processes is, therefore, critical both for the identification of individuals at risk and for the development of new intervention strategies.

abstract={Although much of the current clinical research is directed toward practitioner-centered refinement of RA techniques and technology, it is important to consider pharmacologic advances in perineural analgesia as the next major patient-centered advancement of our specialty. With all due respect to excellent bench science work with novel drugs and toxins that may not gain approval of the Food and Drug Administration for many years, it is useful to know that four Food and Drug Administration- approved drugs are commercially available for potentially ground-breaking off-label use, pending ongoing research. The extent to which estimated clinical concentrations of clonidine, buprenorphine, and dexamethasone, seem to not influence A-fiber conduction holds significant progress for lower extremity perineural analgesia when weightbearing may be desired, if not at least reducing the risk of falls after these surgeries using typical local anesthetic nerve blocks. Research is also needed to determine the extent to which these four drugs may reduce the needed local anesthetic concentration to achieve a surgical nerve block (on bolus injection). Ongoing research in this direction seems to represent the next major advancement in the subspecialty, being distinguished from refinement research involving strictly techniques and technology. © 2012, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={The dual intervention point model states that body mass is controlled by upper and lower intervention points, above and below which animals (and humans) intervene physiologically to bring their body mass back into the acceptable range. It has been further suggested that the lower intervention point may be defined by the risk of starvation, while the upper intervention point may be defined by the risk of predation. The objective of the present study was to test whether the risk of starvation determines the lower intervention point and to examine the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that underpin the regulation of body mass, when the risk of starvation is increased. Sixty-four mice were exposed to random days of complete fasting or 50% food restriction and their body mass and fat mass responses were measured. Food intake, physical activity and body temperature were measured throughout the experiment. In addition, plasma leptin and insulin, triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acids, along with hypothalamic neuropeptides gene expression in the arcuate nucleus were assessed after 13 and 42. days of treatment. We found that C57BL/6J mice increased body mass and fatness in response to a short-term (13. days) intermittent fasting, which was restored to baseline as the treatment was prolonged. In contrast, intermittently 50% food restricted mice showed no significant changes in body mass or fatness. Over the first 13. days of treatment the data were consistent with the dual intervention point model as the mice showed both increased body mass and adiposity over this period. Over the more protracted period of 42. days the effect waned and was therefore inconsistent with the model. The body mass and fat mass gains in intermittently fasted mice were mainly accounted for by increased food intake. Elevated NPY gene expression after 13. days (three 24. h fasting events) may have driven the increase in food intake. However, no changes were observed in such neuropeptides as POMC, CART, AgRP, Ob-Rb and SOCS 3 or circulating levels of leptin, insulin, NEFA and TG. Hypothermia during fasting days may have also contributed to the increase in body mass. Over 42. days of treatment (nine 24. h fasting events) cumulative food intake was not affected by intermittent starvation. However physical activity, mainly activity during the light phase was lowered suggesting an adaptation to unpredictable starvation. Overall, mice exhibited different behavioral and physiological responses to intermittent starvation depending on the duration of treatment. © 2011.},

abstract={The benefits of bioluminescence for nonsymbiotic marine bacteria have not been elucidated fully. One of the most commonly cited explanations, proposed more than 30 y ago, is that bioluminescence augments the propagation and dispersal of bacteria by attracting fish to consume the luminous material. This hypothesis, based mostly on the prevalence of luminous bacteria in fish guts, has not been tested experimentally. Here we show that zooplankton that contacts and feeds on the luminescent bacterium Photobacterium leiognathi starts to glow, and demonstrate by video recordings that glowing individuals are highly vulnerable to predation by nocturnal fish. Glowing bacteria thereby are transferred to the nutritious guts of fish and zooplankton, where they survive digestion and gain effective means for growth and dispersal. Using bioluminescence as bait appears to be highly beneficial for marine bacteria, especially in food-deprived environments of the deep sea.},

abstract={Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have shown efficacy in the treatment of bipolar disorder, however their specific role in treating the illness is unclear. Serum PUFA and dietary intakes of PUFA associate with suicidal behavior in epidemiological studies. The objective of this study was to assess serum n-3 and n-6 PUFA levels in bipolar subjects and determine possible associations with suicidal risk, including suicidal history and relevant personality factors that have been associated with suicidality. We studied 27 bipolar subjects using the NEO-PI to assess the big five personality factors, structured interviews to verify diagnosis and assess suicidal history, and lipomics to quantify n-3 and n-6 PUFA in serum. We found positive associations between personality factors and ratios of n-3 PUFA, suggesting that conversion of short chain to long chain n-3s and the activity of enzymes in this pathway may associate with measures of personality. Thus, ratios of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to alpha linolenic acid (ALA) and the activity of fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) involved in the conversion of ALA to DHA were positively associated with openness factor scores. Ratios of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to ALA and ratios of EPA to DHA were positively associated with agreeableness factor scores. Finally, serum concentrations of the n-6, arachidonic acid (AA), were significantly lower in subjects with a history of suicide attempt compared to non-attempters. The data suggest that specific lipid profiles, which are controlled by an interaction between diet and genetics, correlate with suicidal history and personality factors related to suicidal risk. This study provides preliminary data for future studies to determine whether manipulation of PUFA profiles (through diet or supplementation) can affect personality measures and disease outcome in bipolar subjects and supports the need for further investigations into individualized specific modulations of lipid profiles to add adjunctive value to treatment paradigms. © 2012 Evans et al.},

Bisperoxovanadium compounds have proven neuroprotective effects in several central nervous system injury/disease models, however, no mechanism has been linked to such neuroprotection from bisperoxovanadium treatment following spinal trauma. The goal of this study was to assess acute bisperoxovanadium treatment effects on neuroprotection and functional recovery following cervical unilateral contusive spinal cord injury, and investigate a potential mechanism of the compound's action. Two experimental groups of rats were established to 1) assess twice-daily 7 day treatment of the compound, potassium bisperoxo (picolinato) vanadium, on long-term recovery of skilled forelimb activity using a novel food manipulation test, and neuroprotection 6 weeks following injury and 2) elucidate an acute mechanistic link for the action of the drug post-injury. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting were performed to assess cellular signaling 1 day following SCI, and histochemistry and forelimb functional analysis were utilized to assess neuroprotection and recovery 6 weeks after injury. Bisperoxovanadium promoted significant neuroprotection through reduced motorneuron death, increased tissue sparing, and minimized cavity formation in rats. Enhanced forelimb functional ability during a treat-eating assessment was also observed. Additionally, bisperoxovanadium significantly enhanced downstream Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and reduced autophagic activity, suggesting inhibition of the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten as a potential mechanism of bisperoxovanadium action following traumatic spinal cord injury. Overall, this study demonstrates the efficacy of a clinically applicable pharmacological therapy for rapid initiation of neuroprotection post-spinal cord injury, and sheds light on the signaling involved in its action. © 2012 Walker et al.},

abstract={The unrelenting rise in global rates of non-communicable disease has necessitated a thorough re-evaluation of the current use of adult- and lifestyle-based strategies to curb the growing epidemic. There is a rapidly emerging set of epidemiological, experimental and clinical data suggesting that developmental factors play a considerable role in determining individual disease risk later in life. This phenomenon is known as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). Developmental factors, such as maternal and paternal nutrition, gestational diabetes mellitus, and even the normative range of developmental experiences, may evoke the processes of developmental plasticity which enable an organism to change its developmental trajectory in response to environmental cues. However in the event of a mismatch between the early and mature environment, such anticipatory responses may become maladaptive and lead to elevated risk of disease. The evo-devo and eco-evo-devo framework for DOHaD has more recently been supported by mechanistic insights enabled by rapid advances in epigenetic research. Increasing evidence suggests that developmental plasticity may be effected by epigenetically mediated modulation of the expression of specific genes. These mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications and noncoding RNA activity. A growing number of animal studies also point towards the transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks, which may have implications for the perpetuation of ill-health. However early-life epigenotyping may find utility as a prognostic marker of metabolic dysfunction for identification and treatment of at-risk individuals. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Our understanding of how value-related information is encoded in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is based mainly on the responses of individual putative dopamine neurons. In contrast to cortical areas, the nature of coordinated interactions between groups of VTA neurons during motivated behavior is largely unknown. These interactions can strongly affect information processing, highlighting the importance of investigating network level activity. We recorded the activity of multiple single units and local field potentials (LFP) in the VTA during a task in which rats learned to associate novel stimuli with different outcomes. We found that coordinated activity of VTA units with either putative dopamine or GABA waveforms was influenced differently by rewarding versus aversive outcomes. Specifically, after learning, stimuli paired with a rewarding outcome increased the correlation in activity levels between unit pairs whereas stimuli paired with an aversive outcome decreased the correlation. Paired single unit responses also became more redundant after learning. These response patterns flexibly tracked the reversal of contingencies, suggesting that learning is associated with changing correlations and enhanced functional connectivity between VTA neurons. Analysis of LFP recorded simultaneously with unit activity showed an increase in the power of theta oscillations when stimuli predicted reward but not an aversive outcome. With learning, a higher proportion of putative GABA units were phase locked to the theta oscillations than putative dopamine units. These patterns also adapted when task contingencies were changed. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VTA neurons organize flexibly as functional networks to support appetitive and aversive learning. © 2012 Kim et al.},

abstract={Cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) is more persistent in food-restricted than ad libitum fed rats. This study assessed whether food restriction acts during conditioning and/or expression to increase persistence. In Experiment 1, rats were food-restricted during conditioning with a 7.0 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of cocaine. After the first CPP test, half of the rats were switched to ad libitum feeding for three weeks, half remained on food restriction, and this was followed by CPP testing. Rats tested under the ad libitum feeding condition displayed extinction by the fifth test. Their CPP did not reinstate in response to overnight food deprivation or a cocaine prime. Rats maintained on food restriction displayed a persistent CPP. In Experiment 2, rats were ad libitum fed during conditioning with the 7.0 mg/kg dose. In the first test only a trend toward CPP was displayed. Rats maintained under the ad libitum feeding condition did not display a CPP during subsequent testing and did not respond to a cocaine prime. Rats tested under food-restriction also did not display a CPP, but expressed a CPP following a cocaine prime. In Experiment 3, rats were ad libitum fed during conditioning with a 12.0 mg/kg dose. After the first test, half of the rats were switched to food restriction for three weeks. Rats that were maintained under the ad libitum condition displayed extinction by the fourth test. Their CPP was not reinstated by a cocaine prime. Rats tested under food-restriction displayed a persistent CPP. These results indicate that food restriction lowers the threshold dose for cocaine CPP and interacts with a previously acquired CPP to increase its persistence. In so far as CPP models Pavlovian conditioning that contributes to addiction, these results suggest the importance of diet and the physiology of energy balance as modulatory factors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={We explored the consequences of male and female explorative and risk-taking behaviors that are components of a behavioral syndrome, as well as basic demographic and physical characteristics of three measures of reproductive performance in Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri). Older individuals of both sexes performed slightly better in measures of annual reproductive performance. Age was also positively correlated within pairs. In some years, males in better winter body condition performed better, whereas higher-performing females were in worse condition. Because winter body condition was negatively correlated within pairs, males in better condition possibly enabled their mates to invest more in reproduction in a given year, losing more body mass than low-performing females. Overall, variation in individual male and female traits, especially behavioral traits, explained little of the variation in annual reproductive performance. That age was identifed as the single most consistent factor, which was correlated within pairs, suggests that experience and compatibility may be more important than inherent individual traits. By contrast, when examining reproductive performance over multiple years, less explorative and risk-averse males produced more offspring over the 3-year study period; the direction of relationships of the four behavioral traits in the syndrome was highly consistent. This suggests an advantage for linkage of these traits in a syndrome, supporting the hypothesis that the combination of traits in behavioral syndromes may be a target for selection. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012.

abstract={Female songbirds are attracted to male song, and song may honestly signal male quality. Song is a phenotypic expression of a complex learned behavior and therefore could be indicative of other cognitive abilities. Stressful conditions during early development are known to adversely affect the development of the mammalian and avian brain, and recent evidence suggests a positive association between song quality and learning ability. However, prior studies have not assessed how early-life stress affects both general cognitive functioning and song learning. We subjected nestling-and juvenile-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to either an ad libitum or food-restricted diet until approximately 90 days of age. As adults, birds' cognitive abilities were assessed via spatial foraging and social learning tasks, while controlling for the effects of neophobia. Song learning was assessed in undirected and directed singing contexts. We found that birds fed the ad libitum diet had significantly longer song bouts in both singing contexts, made fewer errors in the spatial foraging task, but performed worse on the social learning task than food-restricted birds. Overall, song performance only correlated with performance on the spatial foraging task: Males with longer mean song bouts in the directed singing context committed fewer errors. These data suggest that the neural structures supporting song and spatial abilities are both affected by nutritional stress during development. Female starlings are attracted to longer song bouts and may thus use song bout length to infer spatial learning abilities of potential mates. © 2011 The Author.},

abstract={Objective: Improvements in diet can decrease the cancer rates. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationships between self-perception of diet quality and personality, impulsiveness, stress, coping strategy, sense of coherence, self-efficacy, and social support. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a multiple-stratified random sampling method based on the Korea Census of 2007. In October 2009, investigators conducted 15-minute face-to-face interviews with 1,530 South Korean volunteers who ranged from 30 to 69 years of age without a history of cancer. Results: Respondents were more likely to perceive that they consumed a healthy diet if they were older than 50 years, lived with a partner, had a monthly family income greater than $4,000 USD, had a low perceived risk of cancer, consumed less alcohol, exercised regularly, had a less agreeable or conscientious personality, had low stress levels, had a high sense of coherence or self-efficacy, and had ample social support. Conclusion: Psychosocial factors, such as personality, stress, sense of coherence, self-efficacy, and social support, are associated with the self-perception of diet quality. Analysis of the factors that contribute to a perceived healthy diet could assist with the design of educational campaigns.},

The impact of anthropogenic and environmental changes on ecological functions of these areas need to be identified as a basis for establishing adequate ecohydrological measures for the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem and its associated services. Patterns of habitat selection were examined in wild-caught larvae of Atherina boyeri (Risso, 1810), by means of microcosms experiments. We simulated three habitats representative of vertical marsh profile at Guadiana wetland, non-vegetated bottom (sand) and two vegetation types (Spartina maritima and Sarcorcornia spp.), in experimental units and monitored fish larvae spatial distribution by video-recording. We observed a strong avoidance of both vegetated habitats suggesting that habitat choice behavior may be dependent on external stimuli such as current velocity, predator effect and food availability. Similar experiments including external factors are required to unravel the behavioral responses of A. boyeri to different types of habitat.},

abstract={Overweight sedentary individuals are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some neurological disorders. Beneficial effects of dietary energy restriction (DER) and exercise on brain structural plasticity and behaviors have been demonstrated in animal models of aging and acute (stroke and trauma) and chronic (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) neurological disorders. The findings described later, and evolutionary considerations, suggest brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in the integration and optimization of behavioral and metabolic responses to environments with limited energy resources and intense competition. In particular, BDNF signaling mediates adaptive responses of the central, autonomic, and peripheral nervous systems from exercise and DER. In the hypothalamus, BDNF inhibits food intake and increases energy expenditure. By promoting synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus, BDNF mediates exercise- and DER-induced improvements in cognitive function and neuroprotection. DER improves cardiovascular stress adaptation by a mechanism involving enhancement of brainstem cholinergic activity. Collectively, findings reviewed in this paper provide a rationale for targeting BDNF signaling for novel therapeutic interventions in a range of metabolic and neurological disorders. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Food availability and predation risk have been shown to affect phenotypes during early life history of fishes. Galaxias maculatus, a small fish widely distributed around the southern hemisphere, clearly exhibits a complex trade-off between feeding and predation avoidance during growth over the larval period. We studied the effect of different environmental variables on diet, growth, mortality, and morphology through field surveys and data revision in the literature for limnetic G. maculatus larvae in five oligotrophic lakes of Patagonia. Both number of food categories and prey ingested by larvae were directly related to zooplankton density. Larval growth rate was related with zooplankton density and temperature. Lakes with high zooplankton densities and low predation risk had larvae with deeper bodies and shorter caudal peduncles, while in lakes with less food and high predation risk larvae were slender with shallower bodies and longer peduncles. Food availability and predation risk seem to operate on the swimming performance of G. maculatus larvae through the slenderness of the body and the length of the caudal peduncle. The observed phenotypic variation in growth and morphology could be a key feature that has allowed this species to successfully colonize a wide variety of environments in the southern hemisphere. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={There is strong evidence that perfectionism is a risk factor for eating disorders. Women who engage in dance training have been reported to be at risk for eating disorders, and it has been hypothesised that expectancies about thinness and restricting food intake are formed partly as a result of exposure to thinness related learning (TRL) experiences in this environment, which may increase their risk. To clarify the relative contribution of perfectionism and learning in accounting for eating disorder symptoms in this group, 142 female ballet dancers completed an online survey. Through structural equation modelling it was found that the association between perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms was partially mediated by learning about thinness and restriction. The results suggest that eating disorder symptoms in dancers are significantly influenced by the interaction of perfectionism and learning, and future research should investigate the efficacy of prevention programs to target these risk factors in female dancers. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.},

abstract={Eutrophication-induced changes to benthic faunal activities are problems of significant ecological impact, affecting global nutrient budgets as well as local trophic connections. We address the question of how nitrogen loads to estuarine embayments alter the bioturbation activities of benthic fauna. Specifically, we related local benthic activities to calculated local nitrogen concentrations for 22 northeastern US estuaries. These local nitrogen concentrations were derived from the calculated nitrogen loading for the embayment together with the spatial distribution of the local flushing time. Our results showed a maximum bioturbation rate at intermediate nitrogen concentrations or a "hump-shaped" pattern of response. This behavior was evident in all embayments that had a range of concentrations including low, intermediate, and high values. Embayments where sampling did not include this full range did not show this behavior. This work provides methods and guidance to help managers make decisions concerning the effects of nitrogen loading on the activities and well-being of benthic fauna in coastal embayments. The novelty of this approach lies in identifying the response of bioturbation to nitrogen loading in many systems, without costly and time-consuming speciation of benthic fauna, and also in rapidly identifying embayments and aquatic areas with vulnerable fauna. These results are ecologically significant in supporting the hypothesis that benthic organism abundance and activity will peak at mid-levels of nitrogen due to the interplay of food availability and oxygen levels, noting that the critical levels of these factors differ among water bodies. © 2011 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (outside the USA).},

abstract={Rats generate stereotyped exploratory (5-12 Hz) vibrissa movements when navigating through their environment. Like other rhythmic behaviors, the production of whisking relies on a subcortical pattern generator. However, the relatively large vibrissae representation in motor cortex (vMCx) suggests that cortex also contributes to the control of whisker movements. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between neuronal activity in vMCx and the kinematics of vibrissae movements. We recorded multiunit activity (MUA) and single units in the rhythmic region of vMCx while measuring vibrissa position in awake, head-restrained rats. The rats were engaged in one of two behavioral tasks where they were rewarded for either 1) producing noncontact whisking epochs that met specified criteria (epochs ≥4 Hz, whisks >5 mm) or 2) whisking to contact an object. There was significant coherence between the frequency of MUA and vibrissae movements during free-air whisking but not when animals were using their vibrissae to contact an object. Spike rate in vMCx was most frequently correlated with the amplitude of vibrissa movements; correlations with movement frequency did not exceed chance levels. These findings suggest that the specific parameter under cortical control may be the amplitude of whisker movements. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Animals learn to prefer flavors associated with the intake of dietary fats such as corn oil (CO) solutions. We previously reported that fat-conditioned flavor preferences in rats were relatively unaffected by systemic treatment with dopamine D1 and D2 antagonsits. The present study examined whether systemic opioid (naltrexone, NTX) or NMDA (MK-801) receptor antagonists altered the acquisition and/or expression of CO-CFP. The CFP was produced by training rats to drink one novel flavor (CS+, e.g., cherry) mixed in a 3.5% CO solution and another flavor (CS-, e.g., grape) in a 0.9% CO solution. In expression studies, food-restricted rats drank these solutions in one-bottle sessions (2 h) over 10 d. Subsequent two-bottle tests with the CS+ and CS- flavors mixed in 0.9% CO solutions occurred 0.5 h after systemic administration of vehicle (VEH), NTX (0.1-5 mg/kg) or MK-801 (50-200 μg/kg). Rats displayed a robust CS+ preference following VEH treatment (85-88%) which was significantly though moderately attenuated by NTX (69-70%). The lower doses of MK-801 slightly reduced the CS+ preference; the high dose blocked the CS+ preference (49%) but also markedly reduced overall CS intake. In separate acquisition studies, rats received VEH or NTX (0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) or MK-801 (100 μg/kg) 0.5 h prior to 1-bottle training trials with CS+/3.5% CO and CS-/0.9% CO training solutions. Additional Limited VEH groups were trained with intakes limited to that of the NTX and MK-801 groups. Subsequent two-bottle CS+ vs. CS- tests were conducted without injections. Significant and persistent CS+ preferences were observed in VEH (77-84%) and Limited VEH (88%) groups. NTX treatment during training failed to block the acquisition of CO-CFP although the magnitude of the CS+ preference was reduced by 0.5 (70%) and 1.0 (72%) mg/kg doses relative to the Limited VEH treatment (88%). In contrast, MK-801 (100 μg/kg) treatment during training blocked the acquisition of the CO-CFP. These data suggest a critical role for NMDA, but not opioid receptor signaling in the acquisition of a fat conditioned flavor preferences, and at best limited involvement of NMDA and opioid receptors in the expression of a previously learned preference. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Climate change is taking place more rapidly and severely in the Arctic than anywhere on the globe, exposing Arctic vertebrates to a host of impacts. Changes in the cryosphere dominate the physical changes that already affect these animals, but increasing air temperatures, changes in precipitation, and ocean acidification will also affect Arctic ecosystems in the future. Adaptation via natural selection is problematic in such a rapidly changing environment. Adjustment via phenotypic plasticity is therefore likely to dominate Arctic vertebrate responses in the short term, and many such adjustments have already been documented. Changes in phenology and range will occur for most species but will only partly mitigate climate change impacts, which are particularly difficult to forecast due to the many interactions within and between trophic levels. Even though Arctic species richness is increasing via immigration from the South, many Arctic vertebrates are expected to become increasingly threatened during this century. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Abstract: Baby-Led Weaning (BLW) is an alternative method for introducing complementary foods to infants in which the infant feeds themselves hand-held foods instead of being spoon-fed by an adult. The BLW infant also shares family food and mealtimes and is offered milk (ideally breast milk) on demand until they self-wean. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many parents are choosing this method instead of conventional spoon-feeding of purées. Observational studies suggest that BLW may encourage improved eating patterns and lead to a healthier body weight, although it is not yet clear whether these associations are causal. This review evaluates the literature with respect to the prerequisites for BLW, which we have defined as beginning complementary foods at six months (for safety reasons), and exclusive breastfeeding to six months (to align with WHO infant feeding guidelines); the gross and oral motor skills required for successful and safe self-feeding of whole foods from six months; and the practicalities of family meals and continued breastfeeding on demand. Baby-Led Weaning will not suit all infants and families, but it is probably achievable for most. However, ultimately, the feasibility of BLW as an approach to infant feeding can only be determined in a randomized controlled trial. Given the popularity of BLW amongst parents, such a study is urgently needed. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been frequently measured throughout the Southern Ocean food web for which little information is available to assess the potential risks of POP exposure. The current study evaluated the toxicological sensitivity of a key Southern Ocean species, Antarctic krill, to aqueous exposure of p,p′-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE). Behavioural endpoints were used as indicators of sublethal toxicity. Immediate behavioural responses (partial immobility and tail flicking) most likely reflect neurotoxicity, while the p,p′-DDE body residue causing a median level of sublethal toxicity in Antarctic krill following 96h exposure (IEC50 sublethal toxicity=3.9±0.21mmol/kg lipid weight) is comparable to those known to cause sublethal narcosis in temperate aquatic species. Critical body residues (CBRs) were more reproducible across tests than effective seawater concentrations. These findings support the concept of the CBR approach, that effective tissue residues are comparable across species and geographical ranges despite differences in environmental factors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={1.Many prey organisms exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits that facilitate a better chance of survival in the presence of predators. The evolution of such plastic traits requires that the defensive phenotype incurs a cost in the absence of predation. 2.Model systems that are used to examine predator-induced defences are often organisms with complex life histories that only induce defences during the larval stage. While many studies have detected costs of inducible defences during the larval stage, detecting the costs of larval defences after metamorphosis is also important. 3.We examine the benefits and costs of inducible larval defences in the urban mosquito, Aedes notoscriptus, by rearing them in the presence and absence of predation cues. We compared survival of larvae inducing behavioural defences, when exposed to predation cues, in predation trials with predatory fish Hypseleotris galii to that of larvae reared in the absence predation cues. We also compared life-history traits of predator-exposed larvae to larvae reared in control conditions. 4.Larvae exposed to chemical predation cues limited activity and were able to avoid predation for longer in trials with H. galii. However, predator-exposed larvae suffered retarded larval growth and development, were smaller at metamorphosis and less resistant to starvation as adults. 5.While it is difficult to understand the 'fitness costs' that poorer starvation resistance might confer to adult mosquitoes, it is likely that smaller adult size of predator-exposed individuals would reduce fitness, particularly for females where body size limits the size of blood meal they could take to facilitate egg production. We suggest that the demonstrable costs of inducible defences in mosquito larvae make this a good system for testing theoretical models for the evolutionary maintenance of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={It is well known that the establishment of invasive-fish populations depends on the ability of introduced individuals to adapt to environmental conditions in the invaded ecosystem, including the ability to feed on diverse, locally available prey resources. Furthermore, the current invasive-biology paradigm postulates that having a generalist-food habit is key to the successful invasion of a novel community by exotic species. This study investigated how the invasive pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, has succeeded in establishing exotic populations in Florida, USA despite having a feeding apparatus that is characteristic of a specialized piscivore (i.e., fish-eating fish). Pike killifish collected from their point of introduction in south Florida were (1) filmed using high speed video while feeding on live fish- and shrimp-prey to determine whether prey type affects prey-capture kinematics and then (2) subjected to a prey-selectivity experiment to determine which prey type (live fish or shrimp) the invasive pike killifish eats when both prey are available in the environment. Results indicated that (1) prey-capture kinematics were not affected by prey type, indicating that consumption of fish and shrimp prey was accomplished using a stereotypical feeding repertoire, and (2) pike killifish consumed fish and shrimp when both prey were available in the feeding environment. It is concluded that the invasive pike killifish has the ability to feed on alternative, locally available prey using its piscivorous feeding functional morphology and prey-capture kinematics. This study contributes a new perspective to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie success of exotic fishes in invaded communities. That is, the ability of a functional-morphological specialist to utilize stereotypical prey-capture kinematics (= behavior) in consuming alternative, locally available prey types (= dietary flexibility) contributes to the establishment of invasive populations. It is evident that these functional specialists are not constrained in their diet, thus, enabling them dietary flexibility and enhancing their invasive potential. © 2012 REABIC.},

abstract={Animals reared in an enriched environment are less vulnerable to abuse-like behavior and exhibit less persistent drug seeking, perhaps due to a decrease in the incentive value of stimuli associated with reward. The present study investigated the effects of environmental enrichment on Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) performance, a measure of incentive salience attribution. Rats were first reared from postnatal day 21 to postnatal day 51 in either an enriched environment with large cages, social cohorts and novel objects, or in an isolated environment with small, hanging cages, no social cohorts and no novel objects. Rats were then trained on a PCA task for 5 consecutive days, where a retractable lever was predictive of a food reward. Isolated rats predominantly exhibited sign-tracking responses directed toward the reward-predicted lever (indicative of incentive salience attribution), while enriched rats predominantly exhibited goal-tracking responses directed toward the location of food delivery. Both groups learned their respective response type at equal rates. The results indicate that environmental enrichment reduces the readiness to attribute incentive value to reward-associated cues, which may explain the enrichment-induced protection against addiction-like behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vigilance allows individuals to escape from predators, but it also reduces time for other activities which determine fitness, in particular resource acquisition. The principles determining how prey trade time between the detection of predators and food acquisition are not fully understood, particularly in herbivores because of many potential confounding factors (such as group size), and the ability of these animals to be vigilant while handling food. We designed a fertilization experiment to manipulate the quality of resources, and compared awareness (distinguishing apprehensive foraging and vigilance) of wild impalas (Aepyceros melampus) foraging on patches of different grass height and quality in a wilderness area with a full community of predators. While handling food, these animals can allocate time to other functions. The impalas were aware of their environment less often when on good food patches and when the grass was short. The animals spent more time in apprehensive foraging when grass was tall, and no other variable affected apprehensive behavior. The probability of exhibiting a vigilance posture decreased with group size. The interaction between grass height and patch enrichment also affected the time spent in vigilance, suggesting that resource quality was the main driver when visibility is good, and the risk of predation the main driver when the risk is high. We discuss various possible mechanisms underlying the perception of predation risk: foraging strategy, opportunities for scrounging, and inter-individual interference. Overall, this experiment shows that improving patch quality modifies the trade-off between vigilance and foraging in favor of feeding, but vigilance remains ultimately driven by the visibility of predators by foragers within their feeding patches. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Individuals of the same species differ consistently in risky actions. Such 'animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed adjust their 'exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour, to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability. We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key prediction of adaptive personality theory based on lifehistory trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future fitness expectations. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The ability to learn and form long-term memory (LTM) can enhance an animal's fitness, for example, by allowing them to remember predators, food sources or conspecific interactions. Here we use the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, to assess whether variability between natural populations (i.e. strains) in memory forming capabilities correlates with electrophysiological properties at the level of a single neuron, RPeD1. RPeD1 is a necessary site of LTM formation of aerial respiratory behaviour following operant conditioning. We used strains from two small, separate permanent ponds (TC1 and TC2). A comparison of the two populations showed that the TC1 strain had enhanced memory forming capabilities. Further, the behavioural phenotype of enhanced memory strain was explained, in part, by differences in the electrophysiology of RPeD1. Compared to RPeD1 from the naive TC2 strain, RPeD1 from the TC1 strain has both a decreased resistance and decreased excitability. Moreover, 24. h after a single 0.5. h training session, those membrane properties, as well as the firing and bursting rate, decrease further in the TC1 strain but not in the TC2 strain. The initial differences in RPeD1 properties in the TC1 strain coupled with their ability to further change these properties with a single training session suggests that RPeD1 neurons from the TC1 strain are " primed" to rapidly form memory. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Introduction: The aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility of conducting a large-scale study exploring the extent to which self-report psychological and behavioral traits associated with eating disorders occur during pregnancy, to test the design, and to gather preliminary data on the magnitude of the problem. Although eating disorders are estimated to affect 5.9% of women of childbearing age, little is known about pregnancy in women who have an undocumented history of disordered eating behavior in the United States. Understanding and identifying eating disorders is important because optimal maternal nutrition contributes to favorable pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Methods: In our study using a retrospective descriptive design, a convenience sample of 54 postpartum women aged 19 to 43 years voluntarily completed a demographic questionnaire and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) before discharge from the hospital. Medical records were reviewed for documented eating disorders. Results: Fifteen women (27.8%) had scores on the EDI-3 indicating that they had psychological and behavioral traits associated with eating disorders. One (1.85%) of the 54 participants' medical records listed a history of an eating disorder. Discussion: Exploration of self-report symptoms associated with eating disorders during pregnancy warrants further investigation. Health professionals providing care to pregnant women should assess all clients for eating disorders throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, regardless of history. © 2011 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

abstract={Most animals are endowed with an olfactory system that is essential for finding foods, avoiding predators, and locating mating partners. The olfactory system must encode the identity and intensity of behaviorally relevant stimuli in a dynamic environmental landscape. How is olfactory information represented? How is a large dynamic range of odor concentrations represented in the olfactory system? How is this representation modulated to meet the demands of different internal physiological states? Recent studies have found that sensory terminals are important targets for neuromodulation. The emerging evidence suggests that presynaptic inhibition scales with sensory input and thus provides a mechanism to increase dynamic range of odor representation. In addition, presynaptic facilitation could be a mechanism to alter behavioral responses in hungry animals. This review will focus on the GABA B (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition, and neuropeptide-mediated presynaptic modulation in Drosophila. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Methylmercury (MeHg) is an environmental neurotoxicant with adverse effects particularly noted in the developing brain. The main source of MeHg exposure is seafood. However, fish is also an important source of n-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which has neuroprotective effects, and which plays an important role during the prenatal development of the central nervous system. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of DHA and MeHg individually, and in combination, on development using accumulation, behavioural and transcriptomic endpoints in a mammalian model. Analyses were performed on 15 day old mice which had been exposed to varying levels of DHA (8 or 24. mg/kg) and/or MeHg (4. mg/kg) throughout development via the maternal diet. Supplementation of the maternal diet with DHA reduced MeHg accumulation in the brain. An accelerated development of grasping reflex was seen in mice offspring in the 'MeHg. +. high DHA' group when compared to 'MeHg' and 'control'. Exposure to MeHg and DHA had an impact on cerebral gene expression as assessed by microarray and qPCR analysis. The results from the present study show the potential of DHA for alleviating toxicity caused by MeHg. This information may contribute towards refining risk/benefit assessment of seafood consumption and may enhance understanding of discrepancies between epidemiological studies of MeHg neurodevelopmental toxicity. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Lipid droplets are evolutionarily conserved organelles where cellular fat storage and mobilization are exquisitely regulated. Recent studies have defined lipid droplets in C. elegans and explored how they are regulated by genetic and dietary factors. C. elegans offers unique opportunities to visualize lipid droplets at single-cell resolution in live animals. The development of novel microscopy techniques and protein markers for lipid droplets will accelerate studies on how nutritional states and subcellular organization are linked in vivo. Together with powerful tools for genetic and biochemical analysis of metabolic pathways, alteration in lipid droplet abundance, size, and distribution in C. elegans can be readily connected to whole-animal energy homeostasis, behavior, and life span. Therefore, further studies on lipid droplets in C. elegans promise to yield valuable insights that complement our knowledge gained from yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian systems on cellular and organismal fat storage.

abstract={Increased susceptibility to energy imbalance and anorexia in old age are risk factors for malnutrition during aging, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we explored changes in taste-guided hedonic value ("liking") and motivation to obtain ("wanting") palatable foods as potential mediators of age-associated anorexia and weight loss in old Fischer-344 rats. "Liking" as measured by the number of positive hedonic orofacial responses to sucrose and corn oil was not different in old compared with young rats. Taste-guided, low effort "wanting" as measured by the number of licks per 10 seconds was also not different, although old rats exhibited a slight oromotor impairment as revealed by significantly increased interlick intervals. Medium effort "wanting" as measured by performance in the incentive runway was significantly decreased in old versus young rats. Although decreased net running speed was partially accountable, significantly increased duration of distractions suggested additional deficits in motivation and/or reinforcement learning. Together with early satiation on corn oil but not sucrose in aged rats, these changes are likely to have resulted in the significantly greater sucrose preference of old rats in 12-hour tests, and may ultimately lead to reduced energy intake and weight loss. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={As economic expansions raise employment and wages, associated shifts in income and time constraints would be expected to also impact individuals' health. This study utilizes information from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1990-2009) to explore the relationship between the state unemployment rate and the consumption of various healthy and unhealthy foods in the United States. Estimates, based on fixed effects methodologies, indicate that unemployment is associated with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of "unhealthy" foods such as snacks and fast food. Heterogeneous responses are also identified through detailed sample stratifications and by isolating the effect for those predicted to be at highest risk of unemployment based on their socioeconomic characteristics. Among individuals predicted to be at highest risk of being unemployed, a one percentage point increase in the resident state's unemployment rate is associated with a 3-6% reduction in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The impact is somewhat higher among younger, low-educated, and married adults. Supplementary analyses also explore specific mediating pathways, and point to reduced family income and adverse mental health as significant channels underlying the procyclical nature of healthy food consumption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Epidemiological and dietary studies show that nutritional deficit of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) is directly related to the prevalence and severity of depression. Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) during critical periods of development (pregnancy and lactation) is essential for cortical maturation, synaptogenesis and myelination, and may also mitigate the risk for cognitive deficits and psychopathologies in young adults. The present study was performed to evaluate the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) receptors, particularly of 5-HT 1A, and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the antidepressant effect of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. In Experiment 1, the antidepressant effects of fish oil were assessed by the modified forced swim test in adult rats. The data indicated a robust antidepressant effect produced by this supplementation and that treatment of the rats with WAY 100135 reversed this effect. In Experiment 2, cortical and hippocampal contents of BDNF, 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), were determined in animals subjected to the same protocol. Increased BDNF expression in the cortex and hippocampus of both age groups was detected. In 90 day-old rats, 5-HT content in the hippocampus was increased, whereas 5-HIAA formation was diminished in the fish oil group. We suggest the occurrence of a reciprocal involvement of 5-HT 1A receptors activation and the hippocampal BDNF-increased expression mediated by fish oil supplementation. These data corroborate and expand the notion that supplementation with ω-3 PUFA produces antidepressant effects mediated by an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus.

abstract={There are well-known sex differences in the epidemiology and etiopathology of alcohol dependence. Male gender is a crucial risk factor for the onset of alcohol addiction. A directly modifying role of testosterone in alcohol addiction-related behavior is well established.Sex hormones exert both permanent (organizational) and transient (activational) effects on the human brain. The sensitive period for these effects lasts throughout life. In this article, we present a novel early sex hormone activity model of alcohol addiction. We propose that early exposure to sex hormones triggers structural (organizational) neuroadaptations. These neuroadaptations affect cellular and behavioral responses to adult sex hormones, sensitize the brain's reward system to the reinforcing properties of alcohol and modulate alcohol addictive behavior later in life. This review outlines clinical findings related to the early sex hormone activity model of alcohol addiction (handedness, the second-to-fourth-finger length ratio, and the androgen receptor and aromatase) and includes clinical and preclinical literature regarding the activational effects of sex hormones in alcohol drinking behavior. Furthermore, we discuss the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and -gonadal axes and the opioid system in mediating the relationship between sex hormone activity and alcohol dependence.We conclude that a combination of exposure to sex hormones in utero and during early development contributes to the risk of alcohol addiction later in life. The early sex hormone activity model of alcohol addiction may prove to be a valuable tool in the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Patients with stroke experience swallowing problems (dysphagia); increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration; and have increased mortality. We investigated the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of a new neurostimulation technique (paired associative stimulation [PAS]), applied to the pharyngeal motor cortex, on swallowing function in healthy individuals and patients with dysphagia from stroke. We examined the optimal parameters of PAS to promote plasticity by combining peripheral pharyngeal (electrical) with cortical stimulation. A virtual lesion was used as an experimental model of stroke, created with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the pharyngeal cortex in 12 healthy individuals. We tested whether hemispheric targeting of PAS altered swallowing performance before applying the technique to 6 patients with severe, chronic dysphagia from stroke (mean of 38.8 ± 24.4 weeks poststroke). Ten minutes of PAS to the unlesioned pharyngeal cortex reversed (bilaterally) the cortical suppression induced by virtual lesion (lesioned: F1,9 = 21.347, P =.001; contralesional: F1,9 = 9.648, P =.013; repeated-measures analysis of variance) compared with sham PAS. It promoted changes in behavior responses measured with a swallowing reaction time task (F1,7 = 21.02, P =.003; repeated-measures analysis of variance). In patients with chronic dysphagia, real PAS induced short-term bilateral changes in the brain; the unaffected pharyngeal cortex had increased excitability (P =.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.210.05; post hoc paired t test) with reduced penetration-aspiration scores and changes in swallowing biomechanics determined by videofluoroscopy. The beneficial neurophysiological and behavioral properties of PAS, when applied to unlesioned brain, provide the foundation for further investigation into the use of neurostimulation as a rehabilitative approach for patients with dysphagia from stroke. © 2012 AGA Institute.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 1% of children. ASD is defined by core symptoms in two domains: negative symptoms of impairment in social and communication function, and positive symptoms of restricted and repetitive behaviors. Available treatments are inadequate for treating both core symptoms and associated conditions. Twin studies indicate that ASD susceptibility has a large heritable component. Genetic studies have identified promising leads, with converging insights emerging from single-gene disorders that bear ASD features, with particular interest in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-linked synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Mouse models of these disorders are revealing not only opportunities to model behavioral perturbations across species, but also evidence of postnatal rescue of brain and behavioral phenotypes. An intense search for ASD biomarkers has consistently pointed to elevated platelet serotonin (5-HT) levels and a surge in brain growth in the first 2 years of life. Following a review of the diversity of ASD phenotypes and its genetic origins and biomarkers, we discuss opportunities for translation of these findings into novel ASD treatments, focusing on mTor-and 5-HT-signaling pathways, and their possible intersection. Paralleling the progress made in understanding the root causes of rare genetic syndromes that affect cognitive development, we anticipate progress in models systems using bona fide ASD-associated molecular changes that have the potential to accelerate the development of ASD diagnostics and therapeutics. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

abstract={Obesity prevalence among infants and young children has increased rapidly during the past 4 decades, a disturbing trend given early obesity's association with later life obesity and its comorbidities. Fortunately, infancy is a period of great behavioral and metabolic plasticity offering numerous targets for preventive interventions. Modifiable factors that may affect early rapid weight gain and obesity risk include infant sleep duration, feeding to soothe infant distress, and the introduction of solid foods and transitional feeding. We discuss evidence linking these factors to weight outcomes, as well as results from behavioral obesity interventions in infancy, from our laboratory and others'. For example, in a recent pilot intervention, we focused on helping new mothers address three areas of infant behavior hypothesized to affect weight gain and early obesity risk: infant sleeping, crying, and feeding. First-time mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a Soothe/Sleep intervention, an Introduction of Solids intervention, both interventions, or no interventions. The interventions were delivered via home visits and showed positive effects on infant behaviors and weight outcomes at 1 year. Based on evidence from such pilot interventions, we assess the plausibility of targeting behavioral factors in infancy and suggest next steps for early prevention research.

abstract={Background: Sun protection is recommended for skin cancer prevention, yet little is known about the role of sun protection on vitamin D levels. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between different types of sun protective behaviors and serum 25(OH)D levels in the general US population. Methods: Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 5,920 adults aged 18-60 years in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. We analyzed questionnaire responses on sun protective behaviors: staying in the shade, wearing long sleeves, wearing a hat, using sunscreen and SPF level. Analyses were adjusted for multiple confounders of 25(OH)D levels and stratified by race. Our primary outcome measures were serum 25(OH)D levels (ng/ml) measured by radioimmunoassay and vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25(OH)D levels &lt;20 ng/ml. Results: Staying in the shade and wearing long sleeves were significantly associated with lower 25(OH)D levels. Subjects who reported frequent use of shade on a sunny day had -3.5 ng/ml (p trend &lt; 0.001) lower 25(OH)D levels compared to subjects who reported rare use. Subjects who reported frequent use of long sleeves had -2.2 ng/ml (p trend = 0.001) lower 25(OH)D levels. These associations were strongest for whites, and did not reach statistical significance among Hispanics or blacks. White participants who reported frequently staying in the shade or wearing long sleeves had double the odds of vitamin D deficiency compared with those who rarely did so. Neither wearing a hat nor using sunscreen was associated with low 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D deficiency. Conclusions: White individuals who protect themselves from the sun by seeking shade or wearing long sleeves may have lower 25(OH)D levels and be at risk for vitamin D deficiency.

abstract={Physiological and nutritional state can modify sensory ability and perception through hormone signaling. Obesity and related metabolic disorders present a chronic imbalance in hormonal signaling that could impact sensory systems. In the olfactory system, external chemical cues are transduced into electrical signals to encode information. It is becoming evident that this system can also detect internal chemical cues in the form of molecules of energy homeostasis and endocrine hormones, whereby neurons of the olfactory system are modulated to change animal behavior towards olfactory cues. We hypothesized that chronic imbalance in hormonal signaling and energy homeostasis due to obesity would thereby disrupt olfactory behaviors in mice. To test this idea, we utilized three mouse models of varying body weight, metabolic hormones, and visceral adiposity-1) C57BL6/J mice maintained on a condensed-milk based, moderately high-fat diet (MHF) of 32% fat for 6 months as the diet-induced obesity model, 2) an obesity-resistant, lean line of mice due to a gene-targeted deletion of a voltage-dependent potassium channel (Kv1.3-null), and 3) a genetic model of obesity as a result of a gene-targeted deletion of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R-null). Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice failed to find a fatty-scented hidden peanut butter cracker, based solely on olfactory cues, any faster than an unscented hidden marble, initially suggesting general anosmia. However, when these DIO mice were challenged to find a sweet-scented hidden chocolate candy, they had no difficulty. Furthermore, DIO mice were able to discriminate between fatty acids that differ by a single double bond and are components of the MHF diet (linoleic and oleic acid) in a habituation-dishabituation paradigm. Obesity-resistant, Kv1.3-null mice exhibited no change in scented object retrieval when placed on the MHF-diet, nor did they perform differently than wild-type mice in parallel habituation-dishabituation paradigms of fatty food-related odor components. Genetically obese, MC4R-null mice successfully found hidden scented objects, but did so more slowly than lean, wild-type mice, in an object-dependent fashion. In habituation-dishabituation trials of general odorants, MC4R-null mice failed to discriminate a novel odor, but were able to distinguish two fatty acids. Object memory recognition tests for short- and long-term memory retention demonstrated that maintenance on the MHF diet did not modify the ability to perform these tasks independent of whether mice became obese or were resistant to weight gain (Kv1.3-null), however, the genetically predisposed obese mice (MC4R-null) failed the long-term object memory recognition performed at 24h. These results demonstrate that even though both the DIO mice and genetically predisposed obese mice are obese, they vary in the degree to which they exhibit behavioral deficits in odor detection, odor discrimination, and long-term memory. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: To describe a case of intentional ingestion of hand sanitizer in our hospital and to review published cases and those reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System. Design: A case report, a literature review of published cases, and a query of the National Poison Data System. Setting: Medical intensive care unit. Patient: Seventeen-yr-old male 37-kg with an intentional ingestion of a hand sanitizer product into his gastrostomy tube. Interventions: Intubation, ventilation, and hemodialysis. Measurements and Main Results: Incidence and outcome of reported cases of unintentional and intentional ethanol containing-hand sanitizer ingestion in the United States from 2005 through 2009. A literature search found 14 detailed case reports of intentional alcohol-based hand sanitizer ingestions with one death. From 2005 to 2009, the National Poison Data System received reports of 68,712 exposures to 96 ethanol-based hand sanitizers. The number of new cases increased by an average of 1,894 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1266-2521) cases per year (p =.002). In 2005, the rate of exposures, per year, per million U.S. residents was 33.7 (95% CI 28.4-39.1); from 2005 to 2009, this rate increased on average by 5.87 per year (95% CI 3.70-8.04; p = .003). In 2005, the rate of intentional exposures, per year, per million U.S. residents, was 0.68 (95% CI 0.17-1.20); from 2005 to 2009, this rate increased on average by 0.32 per year (95% CI 0.11-0.53; p = .02). Conclusions: The number of new cases per year of intentional hand sanitizer ingestion significantly increased during this 5-yr period. Although the majority of cases of hand sanitizer ingestion have a favorable outcome, 288 moderate and 12 major medical outcomes were reported in this National Poison Data System cohort. Increased awareness of the risks associated with intentional ingestion is warranted, particularly among healthcare providers caring for persons with a history of substance abuse, risk-taking behavior, or suicidal ideation. © 2012 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={The perinatal environment exerts profound effects on the structure and function of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Although certain experiences are essential for orderly brain development to proceed, the occurrence of some harmful experiences can also have deleterious consequences on the developing brain. Over the past decade, we have learned how maternal diet modifies the fetal and postnatal genome substantially and contributes to deleterious health outcomes for the developing offspring [1–3]. There is also compelling evidence that obesity and high-fat feeding during pregnancy and lactation can have lasting consequences on brain development and behavior. For example, children born to obese mothers have a higher risk of having symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than children of normal weight mothers [4]. Similarly, in rodents the consumption of a high-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation impairs hippocampal development with lasting consequences on spatial learning performance in the offspring [5,6]. Accumulating evidence also indicates that maternal and early postnatal obesity also perturbs the development of CNS pathways that are involved in energy balance regulation. This chapter will review the wide scope of structural and molecular changes that have been observed in specific brain regions involved in appetite regulation, in particular the hypothalamus, when individuals are exposed to an obesogenic environment during perinatal life. Anatomy and development of hypothalamic circuits that are involved in energy balance. Hypothalamic circuits controlling energy balance. Our current understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underlie hunger and satiety is scarcely 20 years old (see [7,8] for review). In 1994, the discovery of leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells that acts on the brain to blunt feeding behavior and permits energy expenditure, led to a paradigm shift in our understanding with the realization that our subconscious motivation to eat can be powerfully and dynamically regulated by hormonal signals. This discovery was followed by the discovery of ghrelin in 2000, a hormone secreted from the stomach to promote hunger. The brain sites of action of these hormones have been extensively mapped. In particular, leptin and ghrelin act within complex neuronal networks in the hypothalamus that are responsible for the regulation of energy balance (see [9,10] for review; Figure 11.1). In these neuronal networks, neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are of primary importance. One subpopulation of arcuate neurons co-expresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), which act as major orexigenic signals. © Cambridge University Press 2012.},

abstract={The incompatibility of perinatal undernutrition and adequate nutrition during development increases the risk of early onset of non-communicable diseases in adulthood. However, it has been considered that maternal physical activity may attenuate these effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of physical training during pregnancy on body weight gain, waist circumference, glycaemia and cholesterolemia in adult offspring submitted to perinatal undernutrition. Female Wistar rats (n = 12) were divided into four groups: Control (C, n = 3), trained (T, n = 3), undernourished (U, n = 3) undernourished and trained (T+U, n = 3). During gestation and lactation, U and T+U groups were fed a low protein diet (8% casein) and C and T groups fed a normal protein diet (17% casein). The protocol of moderate physical training was performed on a treadmill (5 days/week, 60 min/day, at 65% of VO2max) and began 4 weeks before pregnancy. At pregnancy, the duration and intensity of training were reduced (5 days/week, 20 min/day, at 30% VO2max) until the 19th prenatal day. At weaning, male pups (CP = 9, TP = 9, UP = 7, T+UP = 9) received standard diet and evaluations took place at 270 days old. Abdominal circumference (AC) was evaluated in relation to body weight. Enzymatic colorimetric method glucose-oxidase/peroxidase and cholesterol-oxidase was used to evaluate fasting glycaemia and cholesterolemia, respectively. Rats from UP group showed high body weight gain during growth, higher AC, glycaemia and cholesterolemia values when compared to CP. Concerning the T+UP group, body weight gain was attenuated, and the AC, glycaemia and cholesterolemia were normalized (p<0.05). These results demonstrate that physical training during pregnancy reduces the effects of perinatal undernutrition on some murinometric and biochemical indicators of adult offspring.},

abstract={Other chapters in this volume address the possibilities that maternal gestational weight gain, maternal obesity, and gestational diabetes influence the risk of obesity in the developing offspring through adverse influences of the intrauterine environment during periods of developmental plasticity. In this chapter we review the literature, which suggests that epigenetic modulation of gene expression is likely to serve as one of the more promiscuous molecular mechanisms with which these maternal and early developmental footprints are cast. Together with other potential mechanisms (e.g., establishment and perturbation of the microbiome) layered epigenomic regulation, genomic instability, and molecular and developmental biology are altering our understanding as to how the developmental origins of obesity and associated metabolic disease take their roots. Epigenetic modifications and the developmental origins of health and disease. While genomic DNA is the template of our heredity, it is the coordination and regulation of its expression that results in the wide complexity and diversity seen among organisms. In the “postgenomic era,” investigators have begun to appreciate higher order architectural features of the genome, which include not only single nucleotide variance in gene regulatory regions (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs), but also genomic structural variation (i.e., copy number imbalance through large insertions or deletions). Collectively, structural rearrangements acting in concert with allelic polymorphisms contribute to the genomic landscape from which disease phenotypes arise. © Cambridge University Press 2012.},

abstract={Previous studies have suggested that asthma, like other common diseases, has at least part of its origin early in life. Low birth weight has been shown to be associated with increased risks of asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, and impaired lung function in adults, and increased risks of respiratory symptoms in early childhood. The developmental plasticity hypothesis suggests that the associations between low birth weight and diseases in later life are explained by adaptation mechanisms in fetal life and infancy in response to various adverse exposures. Various pathways leading from adverse fetal and infant exposures to growth adaptations and respiratory health outcomes have been studied, including fetal and early infant growth patterns, maternal smoking and diet, children's diet, respiratory tract infections and acetaminophen use, and genetic susceptibility. Still, the specific adverse exposures in fetal and early postnatal life leading to respiratory disease in adult life are not yet fully understood. Current studies suggest that both environmental and genetic factors in various periods of life, and their epigenetic mechanisms may underlie the complex associations of low birth weight with respiratory disease in later life. New well-designed epidemiological studies are needed to identify the specific underlying mechanisms. This review is focused on specific adverse fetal and infant growth patterns and exposures, genetic susceptibility, possible respiratory adaptations and perspectives for new studies. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={Experiences of neglect typically create a threat to a child's health and well-being. On the one hand, neglectful parents show a lack of interest in relation to material care (e.g. feeding, clothing, cleanliness, hunger), friendships, school work and career prospects of their children; on the other hand, they fail to meet the emotional needs of their children, being unsuccessful in providing a secure base for the development of competent social behaviours. For these reasons, neglect can play a critical role in the origins of psychological maladjustment and in the early onset of psychiatric disorders. In the present study, the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse interview (CECA; Bifulco, Brown, & Harris, 1994) was administered to 100 Italian non-clinical respondents, aged from 19 to 50, in order to assess how neglect combines with other childhood adversities in generating a fertile ground where psychological risk grows and produces poisoned fruits. Results of the study show that severe experiences of neglect were always associated with other types of maltreatment and failures of care. Adults who were neglected during their childhood were exposed to a number of other adversities, including prolonged separation from mother, financial problems, parental discord and violence, and less involvement with peers. Neglected individuals also experienced more hostility and coldness from their parents, were more likely to be physically abused, were more often left alone without supervision, and had responsibilities of running the household and caring for the emotional and material needs of parents and siblings. A discriminant analysis showed that severe experiences of neglect (those rated at 'marked' or 'moderate' levels in the CECA) were predicted by family discord, role reversal/parentification by mother, and a prolonged separation (more than 12 months) from her, leading to 95% of cases correctly classified. The present findings are consistent with the research literature, underlining that childhood neglect merges with other parental abuses and failures of care, leading to a condition of psychological risk in the child. Results also show the possibility for early detection -and, in the most fortunate cases, even a prevention-f such a risk. This is crucial for avoiding the negative effects of neglect on the development of personality and behaviour. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Obesity affects 32% of adults in the USA. Surgery generates substantial weight loss, but 20-30% fails to achieve successful weight loss. Our objective was to identify preoperative psychosocial factors associated with weight loss following bariatric surgery. Methods: We performed a literature search of PubMed® and the Cochrane Database of Reviews of Effectiveness between 1988 and April 2010. Articles were screened for bariatric surgery and weight loss if they included a preoperative predictor of weight loss: body mass index (BMI), preoperative weight loss, eating disorders, or psychiatric disorder/substance abuse. One thousand seven titles were reviewed, 534 articles screened, and 115 included in the review. Results: Factors that may be positively associated with weight loss after surgery include mandatory preoperative weight loss (7 of 14 studies with positive association). Factors that may be negatively associated with weight loss include preoperative BMI (37 out of 62 studies with negative association), super-obesity (24 out of 33 studies), and personality disorders (7 out of 14 studies). Meta-analysis revealed a decrease of 10.1% excess weight loss (EWL) for super-obese patients (95% confidence interval (CI) [3.7-16.5%]), though there was significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, and an increase of 5.9% EWL for patients with binge eating at 12 months after surgery (95% CI [1.9-9.8%]). Conclusions: Further studies are necessary to investigate whether preoperative factors can predict a clinically meaningful difference in weight loss after bariatric surgery. The identification of predictive factors may improve patient selection and help develop interventions targeting specific needs of patients. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Background: Cancer patients' strengths and capabilities have received little attention from healthcare providers whose primary focus is on patients' problems. Thus, providers miss an important opportunity to build on cancer patients' strengths. New care approaches are needed that nourish patients' strengths and encourage them to take an active role in their care. Focusing on health assets is 1 such approach. However, so far, little is known about the strengths cancer patients use and experience during their illness and recovery. Objective: The objective of the study was to explore and describe cancer patients' experiences and perception of their strengths, needed or used by themselves or supported by their care providers. Methods: In this qualitative, exploratory study, we collected data from 26 participants in 4 focus group interviews. We conducted a qualitative, thematic analysis with an inductive approach to analyze the interview transcripts. Results: Cancer patients described a large repertoire of strengths they used or wished for during illness and recovery including good mood, mindfulness, willpower, positive relationships, hopes and beliefs, protection, and taking action and control. Patients also reported that healthcare providers rarely focused on patients' strengths, something they fervently wished for. Conclusion: Patients want their strengths to be more appreciated and encouraged by care providers, to become active partners in care and feeling in control. Implications for Practice: Our findings support that patients' own strengths are a crucial factor to get through their illness. Nurses should therefore have a greater focus on eliciting and nourishing patients' personal strengths in their care. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health.},

abstract={Approximately 3.0% of young Americans have used anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS). A traditional model of adolescent substance use, the gateway hypothesis, suggests that drug use follows a chronological, causal sequence, whereby initial use of a specific drug leads to an increased likelihood of future drug use. Therefore, the use of illicit appearance and performance enhancing drugs (APED), such as AASs, also follows an analogous progression, whereby legal APEDs, (e.g., nutritional supplements) precedes illicit APED use. We examined the relationship between nutritional supplement use, beliefs about APEDs, and APED use in 201 male (n = 100) and female (n = 101) undergraduates. Participants completed measures of muscle dysmorphia (MDDI), body checking (BCQ, MBCQ), eating disorder symptoms (EDE-Q), perfectionism (FMPS), positive beliefs about the efficacy-safety of AAS use and APED use patterns. A series of covariance structure models (CSM) showed body image disturbance, compulsive exercise, illicit drug use, and perfectionism, independent of gender, were significant predictors of positive beliefs about AAS. Those who used both fat burning and muscle building supplements reported the strongest beliefs in AAS efficacy-safety, which was associated with higher likelihood of current illicit APED use. There was evidence of significant indirect relationships between supplement use and illicit APED use through contact with other AAS users and beliefs about AAS. The potential role for nutritional supplement use in the initiation of illegal APED use is discussed. Future prevention efforts may benefit from targeting legal APED users in youth. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Food can act as a powerful stimulus, eliciting metabolic, behavioural and developmental responses. These phenotypic changes can alter ecological and evolutionary processes; yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying many plastic phenotypic responses remain unknown. Here we show that dopamine signalling through a type-D 2 receptor mediates developmental plasticity by regulating arm length in pre-feeding sea urchin larvae in response to food availability. Although prey-induced traits are often thought to improve food acquisition, the mechanism underlying this plastic response acts to reduce feeding structure size and subsequent feeding rate. Consequently, the developmental programme and/or maternal provisioning predetermine the maximum possible feeding rate, and food-induced dopamine signalling reduces food acquisition potential during periods of abundant resources to preserve maternal energetic reserves. Sea urchin larvae may have co-opted the widespread use of food-induced dopamine signalling from behavioural responses to instead alter their development. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={SIRT1 is a NAD +-dependent deacetylase that governs a number of genetic programs to cope with changes in the nutritional status of cells and organisms. Behavioral responses to food abundance are important for the survival of higher animals. Here we used mice with increased or decreased brain SIRT1 to show that this sirtuin regulates anxiety and exploratory drive by activating transcription of the gene encoding the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) to reduce serotonin levels in the brain. Indeed, treating animals with MAO-A inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) normalized anxiety differences between wild-type and mutant animals. SIRT1 deacetylates the brain-specific helix-loop-helix transcription factor NHLH2 on lysine 49 to increase its activation of the MAO-A promoter. Both common and rare variations in the SIRT1 gene were shown to be associated with risk of anxiety in human population samples. Together these data indicate that SIRT1 mediates levels of anxiety, and this regulation may be adaptive in a changing environment of food availability. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Theory predicts that reproducing females will adjust their behaviour to compensate for increased nutritional demands. However, experimental tests are required, since comparisons of the behaviour of naturally reproducing and nonreproducing females cannot distinguish between true costs of reproduction, individual differences or seasonal variation. We experimentally manipulated reproduction in free-ranging, eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), using a fertility control agent. Our novel field experiment revealed that females altered their behaviour in direct response to the energetic demands of reproduction: Reproducing females increased bite rates, and thus food intake, when the energetic demands of lactation were highest. Reproducing females did not reduce the time spent on vigilance for predators, but increased their forage intake on faecal-contaminated pasture, thereby increasing the risk of infection by gastrointestinal parasites-a largely unrecognized potential cost of reproduction. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Background: Low diet quality and depression symptoms are independently associated with poor glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, the relationship between them is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the association between diet quality and symptoms of depression among Cuban-Americans with and without T2D living in South Florida. Methods. Subjects (n = 356) were recruited from randomly selected mailing list. Diet quality was determined using the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-05) score. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Both linear and logistic regression analyses were run to determine whether or not these two variables were related. Symptoms of depression was the dependent variable and independent variables included HEI-05, gender, age, marital status, BMI, education level, A1C, employment status, depression medication, duration of diabetes, and diabetes status. Analysis of covariance was used to test for interactions among variables. Results: An interaction between diabetes status, gender and HEI-05 was found (P = 0.011). Among males with a HEI-05 score 55.6, those with T2D had a higher mean BDI score than those without T2D (11.6 vs. 6.6 respectively, P = 0.028). Among males and females with a HEI-05 score 55.6, females without T2D had a higher mean BDI score compared to males without T2D (11.0 vs. 6.6 respectively, P = 0.012). Conclusions: Differences in symptoms of depression according to diabetes status and gender are found in Cuban-Americans with low diet quality. © 2011 Exebio et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Plants have shaped our human life form from the outset. With the emerging recognition of world population feeding, global climate change and limited energy resources with fossil fuels, the relevance of plant biology and biotechnology is becoming dramatically important. One key issue is to improve plant productivity and abiotic/biotic stress resistance in agriculture due to restricted land area and increasing environmental pressures. Another aspect is the development of CO 2-neutral plant resources for fiber/biomass and biofuels: a transition from first generation plants like sugar cane, maize and other important nutritional crops to second and third generation energy crops such as Miscanthus and trees for lignocellulose and algae for biomass and feed, hydrogen and lipid production. At the same time we have to conserve and protect natural diversity and species richness as a foundation of our life on earth. Here, biodiversity banks are discussed as a foundation of current and future plant breeding research. Consequently, it can be anticipated that plant biology and ecology will have more indispensable future roles in all socio-economic aspects of our life than ever before. We therefore need an in-depth understanding of the physiology of single plant species for practical applications as well as the translation of this knowledge into complex natural as well as anthropogenic ecosystems. Latest developments in biological and bioanalytical research will lead into a paradigm shift towards trying to understand organisms at a systems level and in their ecosystemic context: (i) shotgun and next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation, (ii) genome-scale molecular analysis using OMICS technologies and (iii) computer-assisted analysis, modeling and interpretation of biological data. Systems biology combines these molecular data, genetic evolution, environmental cues and species interaction with the understanding, modeling and prediction of active biochemical networks up to whole species populations. This process relies on the development of new technologies for the analysis of molecular data, especially genomics, metabolomics and proteomics data. The ambitious aim of these non-targeted 'omic' technologies is to extend our understanding beyond the analysis of separated parts of the system, in contrast to traditional reductionistic hypothesis-driven approaches. The consequent integration of genotyping, pheno/morphotyping and the analysis of the molecular phenotype using metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics will reveal a novel understanding of plant metabolism and its interaction with the environment. The analysis of single model systems - plants, fungi, animals and bacteria - will finally emerge in the analysis of populations of plants and other organisms and their adaptation to the ecological niche. In parallel, this novel understanding of ecophysiology will translate into knowledge-based approaches in crop plant biotechnology and marker- or genome-assisted breeding approaches. In this review the foundations of green systems biology are described and applications in ecosystems research are presented. Knowledge exchange of ecosystems research and green biotechnology merging into green systems biology is anticipated based on the principles of natural variation, biodiversity and the genotype-phenotype environment relationship as the fundamental drivers of ecology and evolution. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Animals almost always use habitats non-randomly, but the costs and benefits of using specific habitat types remain unknown for many types of organisms. In a large lake in northwestern Australia (Lake Argyle), most hatchling (&12-month-old) freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) are found in floating vegetation mats or grassy banks rather than the more widely available open banks. Mean body sizes of young crocodiles did not differ among the three habitat types. We tested four potential explanations for non-random habitat selection: proximity to nesting sites, thermal conditions, food availability, and exposure to predation. The three alternative habitat types did not differ in proximity to nesting sites, or in thermal conditions. Habitats with higher food availability harboured more hatchlings, and feeding rates (obtained by stomach-flushing of recently-captured crocodiles) were highest in such areas. Predation risk may also differ among habitats: we were twice as likely to capture a crocodile after seeing it in open-bank sites than in the other two habitat types. Thus, habitat selection of hatchling crocodiles in this system may be driven both by prey availability and by predation risk. © 2011 Somaweera et al.},

abstract={Simultaneous high resolution sampling of predator behavior and habitat characteristics is often difficult to achieve despite its importance in understanding the foraging decisions and habitat use of predators. Here we tap into the biosonar system of Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, using sound and orientation recording tags to uncover prey-finding cues available to echolocating predators in the deep-sea. Echolocation sounds indicate where whales search and encounter prey, as well as the altitude of whales above the sea-floor and the density of organisms around them, providing a link between foraging activity and the bio-physical environment. Tagged whales (n = 9) hunted exclusively at depth, investing most of their search time either in the lower part of the deep scattering layer (DSL) or near the sea-floor with little diel change. At least 43% (420/974) of recorded prey-capture attempts were performed within the benthic boundary layer despite a wide range of dive depths, and many dives included both meso- and bentho-pelagic foraging. Blainville's beaked whales only initiate searching when already deep in the descent and encounter prey suitable for capture within 2 min of the start of echolocation, suggesting that these whales are accessing prey in reliable vertical strata. Moreover, these prey resources are sufficiently dense to feed the animals in what is effectively four hours of hunting per day enabling a strategy in which long dives to exploit numerous deep-prey with low nutritional value require protracted recovery periods (average 1.5 h) between dives. This apparent searching efficiency maybe aided by inhabiting steep undersea slopes with access to both the DSL and the sea-floor over small spatial scales. Aggregations of prey in these biotopes are located using biosonar-derived landmarks and represent stable and abundant resources for Blainville's beaked whales in the otherwise food-limited deep-ocean. © 2011 Arranz et al.},

abstract={Promiscuous and repeated mountings by females are evolutionarily intriguing as females are expected to be choosy and matings are expected to be costly. We evaluate the evolutionary basis of these behaviours in a high-density population of European badgers. We analysed postpartum mounting behaviour, in 3. years, at two neighbouring social groups each year. We demonstrate a polygynandrous social mating system, with repeated mounting. Mounting was skewed among females in four social-group-years, but overall did not differ from random, potentially because female reproductive success is context dependent, varying with local food availability and female-female competition. Some males mounted more than others; however, male mounting frequency was not related to dominance rank, self-grooming rate, or body condition index. Mounting frequency did not predict paternity success; furthermore, a 16-year genetic data set showed that paternity success was positively correlated with body condition index. Females may therefore mount with males that do not father their offspring to minimize the risk of infanticide from them. Females may also trade mountings for allogrooming from males, but mounting frequency did not vary with relatedness, aggression received from males or sequential allomarking by males. We conclude that promiscuous and repeated mounting in badgers may have evolved to reduce male-male aggression around mounting and the likelihood of infanticide from males by masking paternity. Promiscuous mounting of female badgers does not devalue the previous male's sperm, but may promote sperm competition, genetic diversity and genetic compatibility. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Simulation experiments using the inSTREAM individual-based brown trout Salmo trutta population model explored the role of individual adaptive behaviour in food limitation, as an example of how behaviour can affect managers' understanding of conservation problems. The model includes many natural complexities in habitat (spatial and temporal variation in characteristics such as depth and velocity, temperature, hiding and feeding cover, drift-food supply and predation risk), fish physiology (especially, how food intake and growth vary with hydrodynamics, cover, fish size and temperature) and behaviour. When drift-food concentration was increased over a wide range in 7 year simulations, the simulated population was always food limited. In fact, as food supply increased, the population increased at an increasing rate and consumed a higher percentage of the food supply, apparently because higher food concentrations make more stream area energetically profitable for drift feeders. The behaviour most responsible for this response was activity selection: when food was abundant, fish chose to feed less frequently and more nocturnally, thereby reducing predation mortality so more fish survived longer. These results indicate that the traditional concept of food limitation, that food availability stops limiting population size when it exceeds some threshold level, may not be useful and can be misleading. Results also strongly contradict the concept that a salmonid population is not food limited if the total food supply is greater than the population's consumption. Explicit consideration of adaptive behaviour produced a novel but believable understanding of food effects on salmonid populations. © 2011.},

abstract={Rational and objectives: Neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic peptide that is released during periods of food restriction, has been shown to have a significant modulatory impact on drug-related behaviors. We have previously reported that both acute food deprivation (FD) and NPY injections can reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behavior, a proposed animal model of relapse to drug abuse. However, it is not clear whether the FD effect on drug seeking is dependent on NPY transmission. Here, we used the reinstatement model to assess the role of NPY Y1 and Y5-receptor-mediated transmission in FD-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Methods: Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 10-12 days (0.1 mg/kg/infusion/intravenous). Animals then underwent extinction training followed by drug-seeking reinstatement tests under 21 h of FD and sated conditions. Results: Injections of a novel NPY Y5-receptor antagonist, Lu AA33810 (0.0, 1.0, or 30.0 mg/kg/IP), resulted in a significant attenuation of FD-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking. However, no significant effects on reinstatement were found for the Y1-receptor antagonist, BIBO 3304 (0.0, 5.0, or 10.0 nmol/intracerebroventricular). Conclusions: These results suggest that while signals mediated through NPY Y1 receptors play a modest role in reinstatement, activation of Y5 receptors has a critical function in FD-induced reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Dolphins live in complex social systems with a wide variety of grouping and association patterns. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of these associations (fission-fusion dynamics) is necessary to investigate the underlying factors and mechanisms shaping mammalian social systems in aquatic environments. We used boat-based surveys, photoidentification, focal observations, association analyses and social network techniques to quantify variation in the grouping patterns and fission-fusion dynamics of small, sympatric populations of Australian snubfin dolphins, Orcaella heinsohni, and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, off the northeast coast of Queensland. Schools of snubfin dolphins were larger and more stable, irrespective of behavioural activity, than those of humpback dolphins. While associations of both species showed nonrandom patterns and structure, the social network of snubfin dolphins was characterized by numerous strong associations, whereas the strength of the humpback dolphin's social network did not differ from random. Modelling of temporal patterns of association indicated long-lasting associations were an important feature of snubfin dolphins' fission-fusion dynamics. In contrast, associations among humpback dolphins over time were best described by short-term relationships. The contrasting grouping and fission-fusion dynamics of snubfin and humpback dolphins appear to be a response to different feeding habits and prey availability. Future studies involving molecular techniques and direct quantification of food availability and predation risk will help elucidate the suite of interacting ecological, social and evolutionary factors shaping their social structures. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Compensatory growth is the phase of rapid growth that allows individuals that have suffered a period of growth depression to achieve approximately the same size for age as continuously fed contemporaries. Compensatory growth often implies behavioral changes both during the period of compensation and after the full compensation. The most common mechanism underlying the compensatory response after a period of food deprivation is the hyperphagia that some fish exhibit following the restoration of normal rations. To increase feeding rates, fish have to take more risks to obtain food and hence they might be more susceptible to predation and aggression. Indirect costs of compensatory growth include subsequent deficiencies in locomotion that can affect escape responses and impair sexual displays. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most Old World monkeys show male-biased dispersal. We present the first systematic data on male dispersal in a provisioned multilevel group of Rhinopithecus roxellana, based on 4.5 years of field observations in Shennongjia National Nature Reserve, China. We evaluated both ultimate (inbreeding avoidance and male mating competition) and proximate (food availability and predation risk) factors influencing male dispersal. The focal group contained 34-53 individuals, in 3-4 one-male units (OMUs) and 1 all-male unit (AMU). We observed 37 dispersal events involving 10 of 11 adults, 7 of 8 subadults, and 7 of 15 juveniles. Most interunit transfers within the focal group occurred around the months of mating season. Adult males competed for the leader positions of OMUs mainly through aggressive takeovers, and young males transferred from the OMUs to the AMU at the median age of 41 months, forced out by leader males. No young males older than 4 years remained in natal or non-natal OMUs. The male mating competition hypothesis was supported. The young males emigrated voluntarily from the focal group at the average age of 58.6 months, and no young emigrating male was observed to return, suggesting inbreeding avoidance also played a role in the dispersal of young males. Most emigration/immigration events were parallel dispersal and occurred during intergroup encounters, suggesting increased predation risk during the dispersal period. Males were more likely to emigrate/immigrate during the months when preferred foods were most available. We compared the dispersal patterns in R. roxellana with those in gelada baboons and hamadryas baboons, both living in multilevel societies. Similar to R. roxellana, young male geladas disperse at puberty, but they may return and breed in their natal groups. Males in hamadryas also disperse, but much less commonly than in R. roxellana. Provisioning may have influenced results, and confirming studies on unprovisioned groups would be valuable. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The link between social influence and drug abuse has long been established in humans. However, preclinical animal models of drug abuse have only recently begun to consider the role of social influence. Since social factors influence the initiation and maintenance of drug use in humans, it is important to include these factors in preclinical animal models. The current study examined the effects of the presence of a social partner on responding for sucrose pellets under various motivational conditions, as well as on d-amphetamine (AMPH) self-administration. Rats were trained to lever press for either sucrose or AMPH (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg/infusion unit dose). Following response stability, a novel same-sex conspecific was presented in an adjacent compartment separated by a clear divider, and responding for sucrose or AMPH reward was measured. Rats were allowed to restabilize, and subsequently given an additional partner presentation. Presence of the social partner increased responding only during the first pairing with the AMPH 0.1 mg/kg/infusion unit dose, whereas inhibition of responding was observed during the first pairing during access to the 0.01 mg/kg/infusion unit dose. Under free feed conditions, inhibition of sucrose pellet responding was observed in the presence of the social partner, but this effect was attenuated under food restriction. In contrast, the results demonstrate social facilitation of AMPH self-administration at a high unit dose, thus extending the influence of social factors to an operant conditioning task. This model of social facilitation may have important implications as a preclinical model of social influence on drug abuse. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Aggressive interactions in animals are often resolved in favour of the individual with superior fighting ability, or resource-holding potential (RHP). A recent revival of studies of aggressive behaviour has focused on the assessment strategies used in animal contests. Strategies of dispute resolution through mutual or self-assessment of RHP differ in the predicted relationship between interaction duration and each competitor's relative and absolute RHP. We studied potential components of RHP (mass, length, body condition) and their relationship to contest duration and the level of escalation in the grey treefrog, Hyla versicolor, using a novel method to stage aggressive interactions in the laboratory. Overall, large males were more likely to win than small males, but they only had an advantage in less escalated interactions and were not more successful in physical fights. There was limited evidence for an effect of body size on interaction duration or the level of escalation. Specifically, the body condition of both the smaller and larger contestant was weakly negatively related to the duration and level of escalation of contests. This relationship is the opposite of what would be expected under any assessment strategy. Given these data, coupled with the lack of relationships between other size measures and interaction duration, we conclude that assessment of body size does not occur in contests in H. versicolor. Other unmeasured components of RHP may play a role in determining interaction duration, and the relatively weak and ineffective fighting abilities of this species may limit the dominance of larger individuals. Relatively little is known about aggressive behaviour in frogs. Our method for staging aggressive interactions allows us to address predictions of game theory models in an important group for studies of animal communication. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The Individual Differences Model posits that individual differences in physiological and psychological factors explain eating behaviors in response to stress. The purpose was to determine the effects of individual differences in adiposity, dietary restraint and stress reactivity on children's energy intake and food choices. A total of 40 boys and girls, age 8-12. years, with wide ranges of dietary restraint, adiposity, and stress reactivity were measured for total energy intake and choice of energy dense 'comfort' and lower density 'healthy' foods following reading and speech stressor manipulations. When exploring the interaction of dietary restraint and stress reactivity, lower restraint/lower reactivity and lower restraint/higher reactivity were associated with reductions in energy intake (37-62. kcal) and comfort food (33-89. kcal). Higher restraint/lower reactivity was associated with consuming 86 fewer total kcal and 45 fewer kcal of comfort food. Only higher restraint/higher reactivity predicted increased energy intake (104. kcal) and comfort food (131. kcal). The interaction of dietary restraint and percentage body fat revealed that lower restraint/lower adiposity was associated with consuming 123 fewer kcal after being stressed with the entire reduction due to a decrease in comfort food. Lower restraint/higher adiposity was associated with consuming 116. kcal more after being stressed with 70% (81. kcal) of the increase in the form of comfort foods. Higher restraint/lower adiposity and higher restraint/higher adiposity were associated with smaller changes in total energy intake of 22. kcal and 1. kcal; respectively. Both restraint and adiposity moderated the effect of stress on energy intake and food choice. Children with greater adiposity may be at risk for stress-induced eating to contribute to their obesity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: To reconcile empirical inconsistencies in the relationship between emotionally-negative families and daughters' abnormal eating, we hypothesized a critical moderating variable: daughters' vulnerability to emotion contagion. Method: A nonclinical sample of undergraduate females (N = 92) was recruited via an advertisement and completed self-report measures validated for assessing: families' expressive negativity, daughters' susceptibility to emotion contagion, dietary restraint, and disinhibition, eating attitudes, and several control variables (interpersonal orientation, alexithymia, and the big five personality traits: extraversion, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism, and agreeableness). Results: All variables and interactions were entered as predictors in a multistep multiple regression equation. Only an emotion contagion by family expressivity interaction term significantly predicted unhealthy eating attitudes (β =.29, p =.02) and dietary restraint (β =.27, p =.03). Negatively expressive families significantly induced unhealthy eating and restraint but only among young women susceptible to emotion contagion (ps <.05). Discussion: Young women susceptible to emotion contagion may be at increased risk for eating disorders. © 2010 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Gliding has evolved independently at least six times in mammals. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of gliding. These include the evasion of predators, economical locomotion or foraging, control of landing forces, and habitat structure. Here we use a combination of comparative methods and ecological and biomechanical data collected from free-ranging animals to evaluate these hypotheses. Our comparative data suggest that the origins of gliding are often associated with shifts to low-quality diets including leaves and plant exudates. Further, data from free-ranging colugos suggest that although gliding is not more energetically economical than moving through the canopy, it is much faster, allowing shorter times of transit between foraging patches and therefore more time available to forage in a given patch. In addition to moving quickly, gliding mammals spend only a small fraction of their overall time engaged in locomotion, likely offsetting its high cost. Kinetic data for both take-off and landing suggest that selection on these behaviors could also have shaped the evolution of gliding. Glides are initiated by high-velocity leaps that are potentially effective in evading arboreal predators. Further, upon landing, the ability to control aerodynamic forces and reduce velocity prior to impact is likely key to extending distances of leaps or glides while reducing the likelihood of injury. It is unlikely that any one of these hypotheses exclusively explains the evolution of gliding, but by examining gliding in multiple groups of extant animals in ecological and biomechanical contexts, new insights into the evolution of gliding can be gained. © The Author 2011.

abstract={Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 1254-1262 Theoretical work suggests that both negative frequency-dependent payoffs and state-dependent payoffs can lead to individual variation in behavioural plasticity. We investigated the roles of both frequency- and state-dependence on the occurrence of individual variation in behavioural plasticity in a series of experiments where we manipulated perceived predation danger for red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). We found individual variation in plasticity in a trait with negative frequency-dependent payoffs (vigilance), but not in a trait with positive frequency-dependent payoffs (escape flights). Furthermore, there was no correlation between the average level of vigilance under low predation danger and the magnitude of response to increased predation danger, as would be expected under state-dependence. Thus, our results provide support for the hypothesis that negative-frequency dependence favours individual variation in plasticity. However, negative-frequency dependence alone cannot explain why plasticity would be consistent within individuals, and future studies should address the factors that might favour individual consistency. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Aims We examined whether smokers' use of dietary supplements (e.g. vitamin C, multi-vitamins) induces illusory invulnerability that in turn disinhibits smoking. Such supplement use may be perceived as conferring health credentials. Design A single-factor (credentials: with or without) between-subjects design was employed. Smokers were assigned randomly to take either a known placebo pill or a dietary supplement (in fact, the same placebo) in an ostensible health-food test. Setting Laboratory at Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan. Participants Study 1 involved of a student sample consisting of 74 daily smokers, whereas study 2 involved a community sample consisting of 80 daily smokers. Measurements In Study 1, participants reported their perceived invulnerability following the manipulation. In study 2, pre- and post-test measures of invulnerability were administered, and attitudes towards dietary supplements were assessed prior to the manipulation. In both studies, the dependent measure was the number of cigarettes smoked during completion of an unrelated survey. Findings Participants who believed that they were taking a dietary supplement smoked more cigarettes than did controls. Study 1 found support for the role of perceived invulnerability as a mechanism underlying this effect. Study 2 demonstrated the moderating effect played by attitudes towards dietary supplements: a more positive attitude towards supplements increased susceptibility to licensing effects. Conclusions Dietary supplement use may create illusory invulnerability, reducing the self-regulation of smoking. Reminding health-conscious smokers that multi-vitamins do not prevent cancer may help such smokers to control their smoking and encourage them to stop. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.},

abstract={1.Animals can mitigate the consequences of conflicting food-web constraints (e.g. resource availability vs. predation risk) through plasticity in the expression of functional traits. Because functional trait expression in turn determines a species' impact on ecosystem functions, e.g. its trophic function, there is a growing need to develop a predictive theory that links trait plasticity to ecosystem functioning. But there is currently an incomplete empirical foundation on which to develop such theory. 2.To address this issue, we explored the link between plasticity in a suite of traits (e.g. head morphology, gut size, bite size) that determine the trophic function of a generalist grasshopper herbivore facing predation risk. We reared grasshoppers in the field under two single-forage environments where the plant resources had different physical and nutritional properties and in intermediate mixed-forage environments with or without risk of spider predation. 3.We found that in the single-forage environments, grasshoppers became more efficient at ingesting the resource they were reared on. 4.In mixed-resource environments, grasshoppers developed a phenotype that was not intermediate to the phenotypes in the two single-forage environments, regardless of predation risk. 5.We propose that the suite of phenotypic changes observed in our study represent two alternative feeding strategies that vary with the possibility of using behavioural resource selection in different environmental contexts. 6.Our results suggest that plasticity in trophic function may not emerge from a direct link between the primary traits that determine consumer consumption efficiency given the physical properties of its resources (as is customarily presumed) but rather indirectly from secondary traits that may remain latent until such time that they are drawn into play when the species faces a particular challenge.

abstract={Adaptive host manipulation hypothesis is usually supported by case studies on trophically transmitted heteroxenous endoparasites. Trematodes and cestodes are among efficient manipulators of fish, their common intermediate hosts. In this review paper, new data on modifications of host fish behavior caused by monoxenous ectoparasitic crustaceans are provided together with a review of effects caused by heteroxenous parasites. Differences in modifications of host behavior caused by heteroxenous and monoxenous parasites are discussed. Manipulation by heteroxenous parasites enhances availability of infected fish to predators - definitive hosts of the parasites. Fine-tuned synchronization of modified anti-predator behavior with a certain phase of the trematode Diplostomum spathaceum development in the eyes offish, their second intermediate host, was shown. Modifications of behavior are habitat specific. When juvenile salmonids are in the open water, parasites impair their cooperative anti-predator behavior; in territorial bottom-dwelling salmonids, individual defense behavior such as sheltering is the main target of manipulation. It was shown that monoxenous ectoparasitic crustaceans Argulus spp. decreased motor activity, aggressiveness and increased shoal cohesiveness of infected fish. Such a behavior facilitates host and mate searching in these parasites, which often change their hosts, especially during reproduction. Reviewed experimental data suggest that heteroxenous parasites manipulate their host mainly through impaired defense behavior, e.g. impairing shoaling in fish. Alternatively, monoxenous parasites facilitate shoaling that is profitable for both parasites and hosts. Coordination of modified host behavior with the parasite life cycle, both temporal and spatial, is the most convincing criterion of the adaptive value of host manipulation.},

abstract={Background. To study the effects of an aqueous extract of date fruit (Phoenix dactylifera L. Arecaceae) diet on diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats. Methods. The effects of a date fruit extract (DFE) diet on diabetic neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats were evaluated and compared with a nondiabetic control group, diabetic control group (sham), and vehicle group with respect to the following parameters: open field behavioral test, motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), and morphological observations. Results. In the model of STZ-induced of diabetic neuropathy, chronic treatment for 6 weeks with DFE counteracted the impairment of the explorative activity of the rats in an open field behavioral test and of the conduction velocity of the sciatic nerve (MNCV). In addition, pretreatment with DFE significantly reversed each nerve diameter reduction in diabetic rats. Conclusion. DFE treatment shows efficacy for preventing diabetic deterioration and for improving pathological parameters of diabetic neuropathy in rats, as compared with control groups.

abstract={It has been realized for some time that exposure of the developing neonate from conception through birth to (toxic) environmental agents can affect the subsequent health and well-being of the offspring. While organogenesis (the first eight weeks of human gestation) is recognized to be a highly susceptible period for the induction of malformations, the fetal/neonatal developmental phases are now acknowledged to be just as sensitive for many well-documented developmental deficits, amongst which are immune-related disorders. In addition, developing predominantly from studies of maternal stress during pregnancy, a growing body of literature now exists to show that changes in the neurohormonal milieu of both mother/infant during pregnancy and weaning can change immune potential of the offspring. Perhaps even more provocative, there is data to suggest that immune changes in the pregnant mother can in turn modify behavior in offspring. The review below provides a framework for consideration of many of the factors contributing to such processes, and their possible mechanism(s) of action. © 2011-IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in psychiatric diseases. In this study, we considered rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) that are currently used for modeling neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia. Contribution of epigenetic regulation to the effects of the lesion was investigated, using a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Lesioned or sham-operated rats were treated with the general HDAC inhibitor phenylbutyrate, which was injected daily from the day after surgery until adulthood. Changes in the volume of the lesion were monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anxiety was analyzed in the Plus Maze Test. Hypersensitivity of the dopaminergic system was evaluated by measuring the locomotor response to apomorphine. An associative conditioning test rewarded with food was used to evaluate learning abilities. The volume of the lesions expanded long after surgery, independently of the treatment, as assessed by MRI. Removal of the ventral hippocampus reduced anxiety, and this remained unchanged when animals were treated with phenylbutyrate. In contrast, NVHL rats' hypersensitivity to apomorphine and deterioration of the associative learning were reduced by the treatment. Global HDAC activity, which was increased in the prefrontal cortex of lesioned non-treated rats, was found to be reversed by HDAC inhibition. The study provides evidence that chromatin remodeling may be useful for limiting behavioral consequences due to lesioning of the ventral hippocampus at an early age. This represents a novel approach for treating disorders resulting from insults occurring during brain development. © 2011 Sandner, Host, Angst, Guiberteau, Guignard and Zwiller.},

abstract={This paper investigates and reviews literature regarding a range of topics important to the research question - the themes apply across all the topics. The topics include label and package warnings, including tamper-evident features, to review their effect on the consumer behaviour of changing usage or purchase decisions. This information was then applied to gain insight into anticounterfeit product/package efforts. Based on this research, it appears that there is value for brand marketers to enhance their anticounterfeit efforts and consumer confidence by utilizing warning labels and information labels on their labels or packages. Currently, consumer perception of a domestic counterfeit product threat (promoted as genuine products), even for pharmaceuticals by healthcare professionals, although increasing has still been very low. Generally, the consumers believe and expect that the product purchased from retailers is safe and genuine. The study reviewed many key warning and label communication areas: consumer behaviour review, technical specifications, anticounterfeit, tamper evidence/tamper resistance, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol, cigarette, nutrition food and nutrition supplements. To complete the insight on communicating with the consumer, a review of label legibility was included. Before brand marketers consider adding anticounterfeit warning labels, extensive consumer behaviour research should be conducted in areas such as fear appeals and involuntary risk outrage.

abstract={Fetal and neonatal programming is a phenomenon produced by deviations from the normal development during prenatal or early postnatal life. These deviations can increase risk for different diseases later in life and are an example of phenotypic plasticity throughout the nature. For instance, infants born with low birth weight, as a marker of an unfavorable intrauterine environment, are programmed differently and face additional challenges in adulthood; thereby encountering more risks for coronary artery diseases, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, imbalanced immune response, renal insufficiency, and suboptimal cognition. Advances in research in the last decade significantly improved the understanding of underlying mechanisms. Once these mechanisms are understood it is very tempting to implicate them into management. However, the risk and benefit of each new implication into clinical practice need to be considered carefully and evaluated by randomized controlled trials. This chapter will propose and discuss some of the possible clinical implications of fetal and neonatal programming which can lead to possible changes in current clinical management in reflection of latest knowledge on this topic. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.

abstract={Overweight (BMI > 25) and obesity (BMI > 30), in our modern world of food abundance has become epidemic and is associated with a whole range of health problems like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and an excess of cardiovascular and renal diseases. We will describe intra-uterine growth retardation due to maternal undernutrition, life-style and genetic susceptibility as causes for insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. The 'fetal' or 'early' origins of adult disease hypothesis provided evidence for the association between the perturbation of the early nutritional environment and the major risk factors (hypertension, insulin resistance , and obesity) for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome in adult life. In this review we give some epidemiological examples from the "Dutch Hunger Winter" a war induced famine between August 1944 and April 1946 in Amsterdam with less than 1,000 calories per day from government food rations. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that exposure to famine during gestation resulted in increases in impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, coronary heart diseases, atherogenic lipid profile, hypertension, microalbuminuria, schizophrenia, antisocial personality and affective disorders. Maternal undernutrition during gestation has important effects on health in later life, but it is hypothesized that the timing of the nutritional insult determines which organ system is affected. Maternal undernutrition can express itself in the second or third generation. Obesity due to diet and a sedentary lifestyle may result in excess adipose tissue which actively participates in the integration of whole-body energy and fuel metabolism by the secretion of many hormones like leptin, adiponectin and resistin. Life style features like a) disturbance in the autonomous nervous system (biological clock), b) gender, c) socioeconomic status, d) race and e) stress all may be contributing factors in the origin of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Genetic factors influence the different components of the Metabolic Syndrome. Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disorder. The "thrifty gene theory" states that it can be inherited from our ancestors living in an environment with unstable food supplies and famine. For them it could increase their probability of survival if they could maximize their storage of food surpluses. With the term "thrifty genes" one can think about underlying hormonal pathways and metabolic routes like growth hormone and insulin. Inflammation, a second characteristic of insulin resistance, can be caused by Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a transcription factor involved in regulating genes in adipogenesis and, by implication, insulin action. Diet, exercise and preventing stress are the first-line strategies in the management of type 2 diabetes. Exciting results for medical glycaemic control are found in (thiazolidinediones (TZD eg. Pioglitazone). They are agonist for the PPARγ and also have an effect on the recently discovered hormone resistin which probably can link obesity to diabetes-2. However, recently a meta-analysis study and two clinical trials gave for thiazolidinedione-therapy with Rosiglitazone (Avandia) strongly evidence for increased cardiovascular risk and possible cardiotoxicity. Unless no new data are available of ungoing trials it is recommended to chose for other therapies to treat type 2 diabetes. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Results revealed the use of food to soothe to be a valid construct. In addition, mothers who used food to soothe rated themselves lower in parenting self-efficacy and their children higher in temperamental negativity.

abstract={Background: In patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI), n-3 (omega-3) PUFA status is low, whereas the risk of depression is increased. Objective: The objective was to assess whether the plant-derived α-linolenic acid (ALA) and the fish fatty acids EPA and DHA would improve affective states. Design: In a secondary analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Alpha Omega Trial, 4116 of 4837 (85.1%) patients (aged 60-80 y; 79.2% men) who had experienced an MI were included. Margarine spreads were used to deliver 400 mg EPA-DHA/d, 2 g ALA/d, both EPA-DHA and ALA, or a placebo for 40 mo. At 40 mo, the endpoints of depressive symptoms (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) and dispositional optimism (a 4-item questionnaire and the Life Orientation Test-Revised) were analyzed by using a posttest-only design. Results: The 4 randomly assigned groups did not differ in baseline characteristics. ALA supplementation significantly increased plasma cholesteryl ester concentrations of ALA by 69%, and EPA-DHA supplementation increased plasma cholesteryl ester concentrations of EPA and DHA by 61% and 30%, respectively. Depressive symptoms or dispositional optimism did not differ between groups with the use of n-3 fatty acids compared with placebo at the 40-mo follow-up. The standardized mean (±SE) differences in depressive symptoms were as follows: for EPA-DHA plus ALA (n = 1009) compared with placebo (n = 1030), -0.025 ± 0.044 (P = 0.57); for EPA-DHA (n = 1007) compared with placebo, -0.048 ± 0.044 (P = 0.28); and for ALA (n = 1022) compared with placebo, -0.047 ± 0.044 (P = 0.29). Conclusions: In patients who had experienced an MI, low-dose EPA-DHA supplementation, ALA supplementation, or a combination of both did not affect depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism. These findings are in accord with those from previous trials in individuals without psychopathology or without severe depressive symptoms. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00127452. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={Recent studies suggest that spontaneous physical activity (SPA) may be under the non-conscious control of neuroendocrine circuits that are known to control food intake. To further elucidate endocrine gut-brain communication as a component of such circuitry, we here analyzed long-term and acute effects of the gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin and PYY 3-36 as well as their hypothalamic neuropeptide targets NPY, AgRP and POMC (alpha-MSH), on locomotor activity and home cage behaviors in rats. For the analysis of SPA, we used an automated infrared beam break activity measuring system, combined with a novel automated video-based behavior analysis system (HomeCageScan (HCS)).Chronic (one-month) peripheral infusion of ghrelin potently increased body weight and fat mass in rats. Such positive energy balance was intriguingly not due to an overall increased caloric ingestion, but was predominantly associated with a decrease in SPA. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion (7 days) of ghrelin corroborated the decrease in SPA and suggested a centrally mediated mechanism. Central administration of AgRP and NPY increased food intake as expected. AgRP administration led to a delayed decrease in SPA, while NPY acutely (but transiently) increased SPA. Behavioral dissection using HCS corroborated the observed acute and transient increases of food intake and SPA by central NPY infusion. Acute central administration of alpha-MSH rapidly decreased food intake but did not change SPA. Central administration of the NPY receptor agonist PYY 3-36 transiently increased SPA.Our data suggest that the control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets may represent an important mechanistic component of energy balance regulation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Capture and temporary confinement of wild birds are integral parts of wildlife management practice and research used, for example, during translocation or reintroduction initiatives. We report here on the behavioural and stress hormone (corticosterone) responses of wild blackbirds (Turdus merula) to capture and short-term confinement, partly consistent with some translocation protocols. We examine also the relationship between behaviour and plasma corticosterone concentrations. Acute capture induced responses in corticosterone concentration, integrated over 60 min, at the commencement and conclusion of a 22-day confinement in aviaries were similar at 669.1 ± 66.6 (mean ± 1S.E.) and 678.2 ± 115.8. ng/mL/min respectively. However, base levels of corticosterone were higher at final release than at initial capture (6.8 and 2.2. ng/mL respectively, P<. 0.001). This may reflect that the 3-week period of confinement is a chronic stressor. There was an increased propensity for locomotory behaviours (P= 0.001), maintenance behaviours (P= 0.032) and alarm vocalisations (P= 0.04) over the period of captivity. The frequency of alert behaviours (P<. 0.001) decreased, probably related to habituation to captivity and possibly an associated decrease in perceived predation or starvation risk. Individual behavioural responses were generally repeatable across all observation days, with locomotory behaviours showing the highest repeatability (Repeatability. = 0.592 ± 0.084, P<. 0.0001). Significant repeatabilities were also detected for corticosterone concentrations measured at 60 min after capture (Repeatability. = 0.619 ± 0.166, P= 0.0007) and corrected integrated corticosterone (Repeatability. = 0.368 ± 0.166, P= 0.039) measured on initial capture and on release. We used principle component analysis to generate a composite measure of locomotory, alert and vocalisation behaviours. This measure was positively correlated with corrected integrated corticosterone response at release (P= 0.019) when behaviour was summed across all observation days. Corrected integrated corticosterone response at initial capture (P= 0.049) was also correlated with this behavioural measure at 20 days after capture. This, in combination with the consistency in the behavioural and corticosterone responses across the period of captivity, may reflect individual differences in coping abilities to confinement that may ultimately predict post-translocation survival. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We studied the temporal dynamics in the vertical distribution of Maurolicus muelleri scattering layers (SL) by examining continuous acoustic recordings over a 15 mo period in Masfjorden, Norway, complemented by intermittent sampling campaigns. The data revealed known patterns as normal diel vertical migration (DVM), midnight sinking between dusk and dawn, and periods without migrations, as well as novel behaviours consisting of early morning ascents, reverse diel vertical migrations, and interrupted ascents in the evening. During the first autumn of the study, adult fish modified their normal DVM behaviour by suspending their migration in the evening, yet ascending toward the surface in the later part of the night to reach upper layers during dawn. This behaviour was not observed during the second autumn of the study. By mid-to end of November (1st autumn), adult fish had suspended the nocturnal ascent entirely, and in the subsequent period until the end of January, a fraction of the population rather performed limited reverse migrations, slightly shifting their vertical distribution upwards during the first part of the day. From January to March 2008, fish interrupted their evening ascent at apparently random intervals and returned to deeper waters, instead of completing a full ascent to the surface. Our study underlines the value of long-term recordings with the results suggesting that M. muelleri has the capability of changing its behaviour in response to ontogeny and internal state (satiation and hunger) as well as to external stimuli. © Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract={Feeding activities of animals, including insects, are influenced by various signals from the external environment, internal energy status, and physiological conditions. Full understanding of how such signals are integrated to regulate feeding activities has, however, been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the genes involved. Here, we identified an anorexic Drosophila melanogaster mutant (GS1189) in which the expression of a newly identified gene, Anorexia (Anox), is mutated. In Drosophila larvae, Anox encodes an acyl-CoA binding protein with an ankyrin repeat domain that is expressed in the cephalic chemosensory organs and various neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Loss of its expression or disturbance of neural transmission in Anox-expressing cells decreased feeding activity. Conversely, overexpression of Anox in the CNS increased food intake. We further found that Anox regulates expression of the insulin receptor gene (dInR); overexpression and knockdown of Anox in the CNS, respectively, elevated and repressed dInR expression, which altered larval feeding activity in parallel with Anox expression levels. Anox mutant adults also showed significant repression of sugar-induced nerve responses and feeding potencies. Although Anox expression levels did not depend on the fasting and feeding states cycle, stressors such as high temperature and desiccation significantly repressed its expression levels. These results strongly suggest that Anox is essential for gustatory sensation and food intake of Drosophila through regulation of the insulin signaling activity that is directly regulated by internal nutrition status. Therefore, the mutant strain lacking Anox expression cannot enhance feeding potencies even under starvation. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Geographical variation in behaviour within species is common. However, how behavioural plasticity varies between and within locally adapted populations is less studied. Here, we studied behavioural plasticity induced by perceived predation risk and food availability in pond (low predation - high competition) vs. coastal marine (high predation - low competition) nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) reared in a common garden experiment. Pond sticklebacks were more active feeders, more risk-taking, aggressive and explorative than marine sticklebacks. Perceived predation risk decreased aggression and risk-taking of all fish. Food restriction increased feeding activity and risk-taking. Pond sticklebacks became more risk-taking than marine sticklebacks under food shortage, whereas well-fed fish behaved similarly. Among poorly fed fish, males showed higher drive to feed, whereas among well-fed fish, females did. Apart from showing how evolutionary history, ontogenetic experience and sex influence behaviour, the results provide evidence for habitat-dependent expression of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Many of the deleterious effects of chronic stress in vertebrates are caused by the long-term elevation of stress hormones. These negative effects are thought to be unavoidable by-products of sustained activation of the stress response, but the details remain unclear. A comparative perspective may help in understanding chronic stress. We exposed crickets (Gryllus texensis) to a mock predator. A single exposure to a mock predator induced a transient increase in the hemolymph (blood) concentration of the insect stress neurohormone, octopamine. Repeated exposure to the mock predator increased basal levels of octopamine, similar to the effects of chronic stress on the basal levels of vertebrate stress hormones. This study is the first to report an increase in the basal levels of an invertebrate stress hormone in response to repeated flight-or-fight stress. Chronic stress reduced weight gain, and decreased feeding and enhanced weight loss after food deprivation in adult female crickets. However, chronic stress also increased the tendency of crickets to produce sustained flight. Therefore, this study supports the hypothesis that increasing basal levels of stress hormones may be a phylogenetically common response to chronically stressful conditions. It also demonstrates that chronic stress has both positive and negative effects in insects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the underlying network mechanisms generating what-where associations are poorly understood. Recently we reported that some hippocampal principal neurons develop representations of specific events occurring in particular locations (item-position cells). Here, we investigate the emergence of item-position selectivity as rats learn new associations for reward and find that before the animal's performance rises above chance in the task, neurons that will later become item-position cells have a strong selective bias toward one of two behavioral responses, which the animal will subsequently make to that stimulus. This response bias results in an asymmetry of neural activity on correct and error trials that could drive the emergence of particular item specificities based on a simple reward-driven synaptic plasticity mechanism. © 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract={Intracerebroventricular injection of L-ornithine has demonstrated sedative and hypnotic effects in neonatal chicks exposed to acute stressful conditions. However, whether orally administered L-ornithine can reduce acute mental stress remains to be defined. To clarify the nutritional importance of L-ornithine in controlling the stress response, in Experiment 1 we first investigated whether orally administered L-ornithine can be transported into the brain of mice. Mice were orally administered L-ornithine (3 mmol/water 10 ml/kg, per os). L-Ornithine levels were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 30 and 60 minutes post-administration. In Experiment 2, the effect of orally administered L-ornithine (0, 0.1875, 0.75 and 3 mmol/water 10 ml/kg, per os) on anxiety-like behavior in mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze test was examined at 30 minutes post-administration. There was a significant increase in the percentage of time spent and entries in the open arms in the group receiving 0.75 mmol of L-ornithine compared to the control group. Furthermore, locomotion activity in a novel environment was not significantly changed between the control group and 0.75 mmol of L-ornithine group in Experiment 3. Therefore, it appears that orally administrated L-ornithine is bioavailable to the rodent brain and reduces anxiety-like behavior as demonstrated by the elevated plus-maze test. © W.S.

abstract={Current fear-avoidance models consider fear of pain as a key factor in the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Generally, the idea is that by virtue of the formation of associations or acquired propositional knowledge about the relation between neutral movements and pain, these movements may signal pain, and hence start to elicit defensive fear responses (eg, avoidance behavior). This assumption has never been investigated experimentally. Therefore, we developed a pain-relevant fear conditioning paradigm using a movement as a conditioned stimulus (CS) and a painful electrocutaneous stimulus as an unconditioned stimulus (US) to examine the acquisition of fear of movement-related pain in healthy subjects. In a within-subjects design, participants manipulated a joystick to the left/right in the experimental (predictable) condition, and upward/downward in the control (unpredictable) condition or vice versa. In the predictable condition, one movement direction (CS+), and not the other (CS-), was followed by painful stimuli. In the unpredictable condition, painful stimuli were always delivered during the intertrial interval. Both fear of movement-related pain ratings and eyeblink startle measures were more elevated in response to the CS+ than to the CS-, whereas no differences occurred between both unreinforced CSs in the control condition. Participants were slower initiating a CS+ movement than a CS- movement, while response latencies to CSs in the control condition did not differ. These data support the acquisition of fear of movement-related pain by associative learning. Results are discussed in the broader context of the acquisition of pain-related fear in patients with musculoskeletal pain. © 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract={Maternal hypoprolactinemia at the end of lactation in rats reduces milk production and is associated with offspring's malnutrition. Since malnutrition during development is also known to have long lasting effects on cognition and emotion, in the present study we tested the hypothesis that maternal hypoprolactinemia, induced by bromocriptine treatment, at the end of the lactating period affects memory/learning, novelty-seeking and anxiety-like behaviors in adult male Wistar rats using, respectively, the radial arm water maze (RAWM), the hole board (HB) arena and the elevated plus-maze (EPM). We also analyzed serum corticosterone and thyroid hormone levels at postnatal day (PN) 21. Lactating dams were treated with bromocriptine (BRO, 1 mg twice a day, inhibiting prolactin) or saline from PN19 to 21 (the last 3 days of lactation). BRO offspring had hypercorticosteronemia and hypothyroidism at PN21. In the RAWM, reductions in latency observed in CON rats were initially more accentuated than in BRO ones. By the end of the testing period, latencies became similar between groups. No difference was observed between groups regarding the number of nose-pokes in the HB. In the EPM, BRO rats stayed less time in and had fewer entries into the open-arms than CON ones. This pattern of results indicates that maternal bromocriptine treatment at the end of the lactating period results in poorer memory/learning performance and in higher levels of anxiety-like behavior in the adult offspring, demonstrating that even a relatively short period of malnutrition during development can have long lasting detrimental effects regarding cognition and emotion. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={An understanding of how infant eating behaviour relates to later obesity is required if interventions in infancy are to be attempted. The aim of this paper is to review findings from the Gateshead Millennium Study to describe (i) what we have already established about the relationship between infant feeding transitions, infancy weight gain and eating behaviour and (ii) describe new analyses that examine how infant eating behaviour and temperament relate to infancy weight gain and childhood adiposity. The Gateshead Millennium Study recruited 1029 infants at birth and parents completed questionnaires five times in the first year. We have already described how starting solids and ceasing breast-feeding seems to be a response to rapid early weight gain, rather than a cause, and that parents identify and respond to the individual appetite characteristics of their child. A number of questions about eating behaviour at 12 months were used to construct an infancy eating avidity score that was positively associated with height at age 7-8 years, but not with an adiposity index constructed using bioelectrical impedance, waist and skinfolds. Infancy eating avidity score was associated with greater fussiness and lower satiety responsivity on the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 6-8 years. Temperament measured at age 6 weeks and 8 months showed no consistent associations with either infancy weight gain or adiposity at 6-8 years. While infancy may seem a logical time to intervene with children at risk of future obesity, the collective findings from this substantial population-based study largely suggest otherwise. © 2011 The Authors.},

abstract={Organisms have evolved to optimally align the timing of diapause with the seasonality of environmental conditions in order to maximize their fitness. Observations from the Northwest Atlantic suggest that Calanus finmarchicus diapause initiation date varies significantly by geographic location, inconsistent with patterns of seasonal changes of any single environmental factor such as photoperiod, sea surface temperature, or food availability. In the present study, a life history-based model was used to reconcile the apparent inconsistency. The model results suggest that (1) the induction of diapause involves multiple environmental factors as a result of fitness maximization, and (2) in addition to temperature and food condition, predation pressure is another key factor that could affect diapause initiation process. It is further suggested that phenotypic plasticity is likely to be the major source of variation in the timing of diapause initiation for C. finmarchicus. © 2011 Inter-Research.},

abstract={High-protein diets are effective in achieving weight loss which is mainly explained by increased satiety and thermogenic effects. Recent studies suggest that the effects of protein-rich diets on satiety could be mediated by amino acids like leucine or arginine. Although high-protein diets require increased intestinal amino acid absorption, amino acid and peptide absorption has not yet been considered to contribute to satiety effects. We here demonstrate a novel finding that links intestinal peptide transport processes to food intake, but only when a protein-rich diet is provided. When mice lacking the intestinal peptide transporter PEPT1 were fed diets containing 8 or 21 energy% of protein, no differences in food intake and weight gain were observed. However, upon feeding a high-protein (45 energy%) diet, Pept1 -/- mice reduced food intake much more pronounced than control animals. Although there was a regain in food consumption after a few days, no weight gain was observed which was associated with a reduced intestinal energy assimilation and increased fecal energy losses. Pept1 -/- mice on high-protein diet displayed markedly reduced plasma leptin levels during the period of very low food intake, suggesting a failure of leptin signaling to increase energy intake. This together with an almost two-fold elevated plasma arginine level in Pept1 -/- but not wildtype mice, suggests that a cross-talk of arginine with leptin signaling in brain, as described previously, could cause these striking effects on food intake. © 2011 Nässl et al.},

abstract={Background: Obesity is a significant global health problem, with the proportion of women entering pregnancy with a body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2approaching 50%. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a well-recognised increased risk of adverse health outcomes both for the woman and her infant, however there is more limited information available regarding effective interventions to improve health outcomes.The aims of this randomised controlled trial are to assess whether the implementation of a package of dietary and lifestyle advice to overweight and obese women during pregnancy to limit gestational weight gain is effective in improving maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes.Methods/Design: Design: Multicentred randomised, controlled trial.Inclusion Criteria: Women with a singleton, live gestation between 10+0-20+0weeks who are obese or overweight (defined as body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2), at the first antenatal visit.Trial Entry &amp; Randomisation: Eligible, consenting women will be randomised between 10+0and 20+0weeks gestation using a central telephone randomisation service, and randomisation schedule prepared by non-clinical research staff with balanced variable blocks. Stratification will be according to maternal BMI at trial entry, parity, and centre where planned to give birth.Treatment Schedules: Women randomised to the Dietary and Lifestyle Advice Group will receive a series of inputs from research assistants and research dietician to limit gestational weight gain, and will include a combination of dietary, exercise and behavioural strategies.Women randomised to the Standard Care Group will continue to receive their pregnancy care according to local hospital guidelines, which does not currently include routine provision of dietary, lifestyle and behavioural advice.Outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocated treatment group.Primary Study Outcome: infant large for gestational age (defined as infant birth weight ≥ 90thcentile for gestational age).Sample Size: 2,180 women to detect a 30% reduction in large for gestational age infants from 14.40% (p = 0.05, 80% power, two-tailed).Discussion: This is a protocol for a randomised trial.

abstract={Understanding behavioral regulation can further progress by developing new approaches that allow refinement of behavioral phenotypes. The current availability of several thousand different mutant mice and of human candidate genes for emotional (affective) disorders challenges behavioral neuroscientists to extend their views and methodologies to dissect complex behaviors into behavioral phenotypes and subsequently to define gene-behavioral phenotype relationships. Here, we put forward multiday automated behavioral and physiological observations in carefully designed environments to assess evolutionary conserved behavioral strategies in mice. This offers the opportunity to design experimental setups that allow the animals themselves to regulate their own behavior, using representations of continuous kinematic variables, studying the dynamics of behavior (change across time or change across activity); i.e., growth or decay processes of behavior and concomitant physiological adjustments such as heart rate. The measures characterizing these processes should have discriminative power (across strains or treatments) and be replicable (across laboratories). Furthermore, cross species genetic studies for these neurobehavioral and physiological traits may provide a novel way toward identifying neurobiological mechanisms underlying core features of complex psychiatric disorders. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Among all mammalian species, pups are the most highly dependent on their mothers not only for nutrition but also for physical interaction. Therefore, disruption of the mother-pup interaction changes the physiology and behavior of pups. We reviewed the experimental procedure of early weaning, which brings about changes in the behavior and neuronal systems of the offspring of rats and mice. Thus far, we have demonstrated that early weaning results in a persistent increase in anxiety-like and aggressive behavior in adult mice. Early weaned mice also showed higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in response to novelty stress. Neurochemically, early weaned male mice, but not female mice, showed precocious myelination in the amygdala, decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and reduced bromodeoxyuridine immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus. These results are similar to those of human psychological disorders, and suggest that deprivation of the mother-infant interaction during the late lactation period in mice and rats provides an interesting animal model to understand the neuromolecular basis of and psychopharmacological treatments for human psychological disorders related to anxiety and higher emotionality. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Previous studies suggest that binge eating sugar leads to behavioral and neurochemical changes similar to those seen with drug addiction, including signs of opiate-like withdrawal. Studies are emerging that show multiple neurochemical and behavioral indices of addiction when animals overeat a fat-rich diet. The goal of the present study was to utilize liquid and solid diets high in sugar and fat content to determine whether opiate-like withdrawal is seen after binge consumption of these diets in Sprague-Dawley rats. Control groups were given ad libitum access to the sweet-fat food or standard chow. All rats were then given a battery of tests to measure signs of opiate-like withdrawal, which included somatic signs of distress, elevated plus-maze anxiety, and locomotor hypoactivity. Neither naloxone-precipitated (3. mg/kg) nor deprivation-induced withdrawal was observed in rats that were maintained on a nutritionally complete pelleted sweet-fat diet or a sweet, high-fat diet supplemented with standard rodent chow. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal was also not seen in rats fed a liquid sweet-fat food. Further, body weight reduction to 85%, which is known to potentiate the reinforcing effects of substances of abuse, did not affect naloxone-precipitated signs of opiate-like withdrawal. Thus, unlike previous findings reported regarding rats with binge access to a sucrose solution, rats that binge eat sweet-fat combinations do not show signs of opiate-like withdrawal under the conditions tested. These data support the idea that excessive consumption of different nutrients can induce behaviors associated with addiction in different ways, and that the behaviors that could characterize "food addiction" may be subtyped based on the nutritional composition of the food consumed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The geographic range of the Timber Rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) encompasses most of the eastern half of the United States. Although the overall diet composition of C. horridus has been well documented and has been reported to be very broad, local population variation has not been studied. We examined the diet and foraging behavior of C. horridus from four separate populations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A total of 253 prey items from scat samples, stomach samples, and field observation were identified to species or family level. Although voles (Myodes gapperi) and mice (Peromyscus spp.) comprised the bulk of the diet in all populations, relative prey species frequency differed significantly among the four populations. These data indicate that the food habits of C. horridus varied widely even within relatively small geographic distances. Comparisons with small mammal trapping data further suggest that the diet composition of this ambush predator may not simply reflect the availability of prey species. Radiotelemetric observations of C. horridus further indicate differing frequencies of log-oriented foraging behavior among the study sites. Analysis of body posture revealed an alternative ambush foraging posture (non-log-oriented posture) which also exhibited variation in frequency among study sites. However, selected foraging habitats at all study sites were typified by a locally high density of fallen logs and other woody debris (6% of forest-floor cover/m 2). These findings indicate geographic variation in the foraging ecology of C. horridus and suggest behavioral plasticity in foraging response to available prey. © 2011 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.},

Female C57BL/6 mice, previously screened for neophobia, had free access to enriched cages connected to their standard cages. The relative consumption of food in each cage revealed approximate dwelling times; the use of two enrichments was also measured. High neophobia significantly predicted reduced use of the enriched cage. Thus even within this homogeneous population, provided with identical enrichments, differential neophobia predicted differential enrichment use. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Emerging evidence indicates an association between mental illness and poor quality of physical health care. To test this, we compared mental health clients (MHCs) with non-MHCs on potentially preventable hospitalisations (PPHs) as an indicator of the quality of primary care received.Methods: Population-based retrospective cohort study of 139,208 MHCs and 294,180 matched non-MHCs in Western Australia from 1990 to 2006, using linked data from electoral roll registrations, mental health registry (MHR) records, hospital inpatient discharges and deaths. We used the electoral roll data as the sampling frame for both cohorts to enhance internal validity of the study, and the MHR to separate MHCs from non-MHCs. Rates of PPHs (overall and by PPH category and medical condition) were compared between MHCs, category of mental disorders and non-MHCs. Multivariate negative binomial regression analyses adjusted for socio-demographic factors, case mix and the year at the start of follow up due to dynamic nature of study cohorts.Results: PPHs accounted for more than 10% of all hospital admissions in MHCs, with diabetes and its complications, adverse drug events (ADEs), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), convulsions and epilepsy, and congestive heart failure being the most common causes. Compared with non-MHCs, MHCs with any mental disorders were more likely to experience a PPH than non-MHCs (overall adjusted rate ratio (ARR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03-2.09). ARRs of PPHs were highest for convulsions and epilepsy, nutritional deficiencies, COPD and ADEs. The ARR of a PPH was highest in MHCs with alcohol/drug disorders, affective psychoses, other psychoses and schizophrenia.Conclusions: MHCs have a significantly higher rate of PPHs than non-MHCs. Improving primary and secondary prevention is warranted in MHCs, especially at the primary care level, despite there may be different thresholds for admission in people with established physical disease that is influenced by whether or not they have comorbid mental illness. © 2011 Mai et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The predicted global warming may affect freshwater systems at several organizational levels, from organism to ecosystem. Specifically, in temperate regions, the projected increase of winter temperatures may have important effects on the over-winter biology of a range of organisms and especially for fish and other ectothermic animals. However, temperature effects on organisms may be directed strongly by resource availability. Here, we investigated whether over-winter loss of biomass and lipid content of juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) was affected by the physiologically relatively small (2-5°C) changes of winter temperatures predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under both natural and experimental conditions. This was investigated in combination with the effects of food availability. Finally, we explored the potential for a correlation between lake temperature and resource levels for planktivorous fish, i.e., zooplankton biomass, during five consecutive winters in a south Swedish lake. We show that small increases in temperature (+2°C) affected fish biomass loss in both presence and absence of food, but negatively and positively respectively. Temperature alone explained only a minor part of the variation when food availability was not taken into account. In contrast to other studies, lipid analyses of experimental fish suggest that critical somatic condition rather than critical lipid content determined starvation induced mortality. Our results illustrate the importance of considering not only changes in temperature when predicting organism response to climate change but also food-web interactions, such as resource availability and predation. However, as exemplified by our finding that zooplankton over-winter biomass in the lake was not related to over-winter temperature, this may not be a straightforward task. © 2011 Brodersen et al.},

abstract={Socioecological models suggest competition for food, foraging efficiency, predation, infanticide risk, and the costs of dispersal regulate primate social structure and organization. Wild populations of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) appear to conform to the predictions of the predation/competition socioecological model (Sterck et al. in Behav Ecol Sociobiol 41:291-309, 1997) and the dispersal/foraging efficiency model (Isbell in Kinship and behavior in primates. Oxford University, New York, pp 71-108, 2004). However, squirrel monkeys in captivity are reported to maintain patterns of social behavior observed in their wild conspecifics despite different food distribution, predation risk, and dispersal options. This behavioral similarity suggests squirrel monkeys' social behavior has limited flexibility to respond to environmental changes. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the flexibility of social behavior within a captive group of S. sciureus. First, we determined whether dominance and affiliative relationships observed under normal laboratory conditions (with abundant, widely distributed, food; no dispersal option; and no predators) better matched published reports of relationships among wild conspecifics or the predictions of the predation/competition model. Second, we made preferred food items defensible to determine whether dominance interactions would become more frequent and linear, as predicted by the model. The model correctly predicted rates of dominance behavior in both conditions and a linear hierarchy in the defensible food condition but did not predict the consistent affiliative relationships and linear dominance hierarchy observed in normal lab conditions. Although hierarchies were linear and male dominant, manipulating food distribution changed the dominant individual within each sex. Our findings suggest interaction rates adapt more rapidly than social structure to environmental changes in Saimiri and recommend caution in interpreting tests of socioecological models. © 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.},

abstract={Rehabilitation is a recommended first-line therapy for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and consists of supervised exercise training and therapeutic education. Proved benefits are significant: improve pain-free walking distance, functional status and quality of life; reduce cardiovascular risk factors and mortality. At least three sessions weekly are recommended during 3 months. Exercise conditioning (global training and lower limb resistance training) is tailored by the preliminary evaluation of walking ability (free walking test, treadmill tests, 6-min walk test) and of the cardiac tolerance (maximal effort tests). Then the exercise workload is progressively improved. The four main goals of therapeutic education are: smoking cessation, prolonged physical activity, Mediterranean diet and observing pharmacological therapies. The limited compliance of the patients with PAD is often an obstacle for educational needs. The chronic patients with important functional limitations and unchecked risk factors will be preferentially enrolled in such programs. When a revascularization is discussed, rehabilitation can serve as trial treatment. Despite its efficacy, rehabilitation is still underutilized in clinical practice and should be promoted. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={One source of uncertainty in predicting the response of populations to exploitation is individual differences within a population in both vulnerability to capture and contribution to population renewal. For species with parental care, individuals engaged in nesting behavior are often targeted for exploitation, but predicting outcomes of this nonrandom vulnerability will depend in part on an understanding of how parental traits are related to potential for brood contribution to the population. Variation in brood-specific contribution to recruitment of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), a fish species with extended parental care, was quantified to determine if differences in mating success, parental care behaviors, and timing of reproduction influenced offspring recruitment. Dependence of these relationships on brood predation was tested in communities that differed in the presence of bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, an important nest predator. Daily snorkel surveys were conducted in experimental ponds during spring to monitor male spawning and parental care behaviors in populations of largemouth bass. Tissue samples collected from larvae in nests were used to develop brood-specific DNA fingerprints for determining nest origins of fall recruits. Largemouth bass spawning period in bluegill ponds was longer and more variable in duration, with lower, more variable mating success, than in ponds without bluegill. In all populations, only one or two broods provided the majority of recruits, and these were broods produced during the earliest days of spawning by the oldest, largest males. In bluegill ponds, brood contribution from earliest nests also increased with brood size. Earliest nesters were the oldest males, and recruits from these nests were often above average in body size. Offspring needed to be guarded to at least swim-up larval stage to contribute any recruits. Termination of parental protection before offspring were free swimming mainly occurred with broods guarded by smaller males in ponds with brood predators. These age-and size-specific differences in timing of spawning and duration of parental care are consistent with influences of residual reproductive value and energetic constraints on reproductive behavior. Furthermore, these patterns of individual contribution to recruitment imply that fisheries that selectively target either nesting individuals or larger, older males could potentially decrease recruitment at the population scale. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={During adulthood, associative learning is necessary for the expression of one-trial behavioral sensitization; however, it is uncertain whether the same associative processes are operative during the preweanling period. Two strategies were used to assess the importance of associative learning for one-trial behavioral sensitization of preweanling rats. In the initial experiments, we varied both the sequence and time interval between presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS, novel environment) and unconditioned stimulus (US, cocaine). In the final experiment, we determined whether electroconvulsive shock-induced retrograde amnesia would disrupt one-trial behavioral sensitization. Results showed that robust-sensitized responding was apparent regardless of the sequence in which cocaine and the novel environment (the presumptive CS) were presented. Varying the time between CS and US presentation (0, 3, or 6 h) was also without effect. Results from experiment 3 showed that single or multiple electroconvulsive shock treatments did not alter the expression of the sensitized response. Therefore, these data indicated that one-trial behavioral sensitization of preweanling rats was exclusively mediated by nonassociative mechanisms and that associative processes did not modulate sensitized responding. These findings are in contrast to what is observed during adulthood, as adult rats exhibit one-trial behavioral sensitization only when associative processes are operative. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Unlike many species that are 'occasional' cannibals, the tadpoles of cane toads specifically target conspecific eggs for consumption, ignoring the eggs of sympatric frog species (at least within the toads' current invasive range in Australia). We tested three hypotheses as to the benefits of consuming conspecific eggs: transfer of toxins from eggs (which have high toxin content) to tadpoles (which have lower toxin content), nutritional input, and reduction of future competition. We found no evidence of toxin transfer, but eggs contained sufficient nutrition for cannibalistic tadpoles to develop through to metamorphosis, and egg consumption enhanced rates of tadpole growth and differentiation through reduction of subsequent competition from younger tadpoles. Features of the cane toads' life history (e.g. synchronized deposition and development of all eggs within a clutch; delay between hatching and onset of feeding; short larval stage relative to interclutch interval of a given adult female) mean that the cannibals are unlikely to be close relatives of the younger conspecifics they consume (either as eggs or as metamorphs). Kin selection may thus favour rather than oppose cannibalism. The end result is that cannibalistic toad tadpoles benefit through nutrition and reduced future competition, with little collateral risk of eating their own siblings. Another potential cost of cannibalism (risk of disease transmission) may be minimal in this system, because the eggs are unlikely to contain pathogens (reflecting their brief embryonic periods and protective jelly layers). The combination of these forces has favoured the evolution of targeted cannibalism by cane toad tadpoles. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Successful oral feeding of preterm and other ill and fragile infants is an interactive process that requires (1) sensitive, ongoing assessment of an infant's physiology and behavior, (2) knowledgeable decisions that support immediate and long-term enjoyment of food, and (3) competent skill in feeding. Caregivers can support feeding success by using the infant's biological and behavioral channels of communication to inform their feeding decisions and actions. The Supporting Oral Feeding in Fragile Infants (SOFFI) Method is described here with text, algorithms, and reference guides. Two of the algorithms and the reference guides are published separately as Philbin, Ross. SOFFI Reference Guides: Text, Algorithms, and Appendices (in review). The information in all of these materials is drawn from sound research findings and, rarely, when such findings are not available, from expert, commonly accepted clinical practice. If the quality of a feeding takes priority over the quantity ingested, feeding skill develops pleasurably and at the infant's own pace. Once physiologic organization and behavioral skills are established, an affinity for feeding and the ingestion of sufficient quantity occur naturally, often rapidly, and at approximately the same postmenstrual age as volume-focused feedings. Nurses, therapists, and parents alike can use the SOFFI Method to increase the likelihood of feeding success in the population of infants at risk for feeding problems that emerge in infancy and extend into the preschool years.},

abstract={Objectives: To outline the prevalence and disparities of breakfast consumption among school-aged urban minority youth, causal pathways through which skipping breakfast adversely affects academic achievement, and proven or promising approaches for schools to increase breakfast consumption. Methods: Literature review. Results: On any given day a substantial proportion of American youth do not eat breakfast. On an average day, less than half (∼46%) of children participating in free or reduced-price lunch also participated in the School Breakfast Program for which they were also eligible. In a large study of 9-year-olds, 77% of White girls and 57% of Black girls consumed breakfast on all 3 days assessed; by age 19, the respective rates were 32% and 22%. Neuroscience research has identified the processes by which dietary behavior influences neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, both of which influence cognitive functions. Participation in School Breakfast Programs has also been associated with reduced absenteeism. Universal School Breakfast Programs and allowing youth to eat breakfast in the classroom (vs cafeteria) are approaches that have been shown to increase participation. Conclusions: Skipping breakfast is highly and disproportionately prevalent among school-aged urban minority youth, has a negative impact on academic achievement by adversely affecting cognition and absenteeism, and effective practices are available for schools to address this problem. Despite wide availability, the majority of American youth do not participate in School Breakfast Programs. High-quality universal breakfast programs that allow students to eat breakfast in the classroom are especially needed for youth who are not likely to get good nutrition the rest of the day. © 2011, American School Health Association.},

abstract={Background:Childhood obesity is a major health problem. An association between children's body mass index (BMI) and overeating has been established, but mechanisms leading to overeating are poorly understood. The personality characteristics impulsivity and reward responsiveness may be involved in the tendency to overeat. Impulsivity might relate to overeating through poor inhibition of food intake; reward responsiveness through the rewarding value of food.Objective:This study aimed to reveal the relationships between impulsivity, reward responsiveness, overeating and BMI in a sample of 346 Dutch children aged 6-13 years. The BMI distribution in the sample was representative of the BMI distribution in the Dutch pediatric population.Methods:Impulsivity and reward responsiveness were measured with the Dutch version of the parent-report Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire for children. Overeating was assessed with the Dutch translation of the parent-report Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire.Results:Overeating, impulsivity and reward responsiveness were significantly associated with childhood BMI. Mediation analysis revealed that impulsivity and reward responsiveness equally and significantly predicted BMI indirectly through overeating.Conclusions:The personality characteristics impulsivity and reward responsiveness predict childhood BMI indirectly through overeating. This suggests that these personality characteristics are risk factors for obesity. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={This prospective study investigated personality traits as predictors of the outcome in a 52-week weight-loss program for obesity. Personality traits were rated with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP) in 54 consecutive obese outpatients when entering a multimodal weight-reduction program. The value of these variables to predict success was assessed after 12, 26, and 52 weeks of treatment. A stepwise linear regression analysis for all follow-ups was calculated to examine the impact of each IIP subscale on weight reduction. The IIP subscale intrusive or needy significantly correlated with weight reduction observed at every follow-up examination and accounts for 13.6% to 29.8% of the variance (p values <.05). Obese patients describing themselves as excessively friendly, outgoing, and sociable improved more from a weight-loss program than those with lower instances of these traits. Accordingly, personality traits deserve more attention at initial assessment and while planning treatment of obese patients. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Risk is a ubiquitous feature of the environment for most organisms, who must often choose between a small and certain reward and a larger but less certain reward. To study choice behavior under risk in a genetically well characterized species, we trained mice (C57BL/6) on a discrete trial, concurrent-choice task in which they must choose between two levers. Pressing one lever (safe choice) is always followed by a small reward. Pressing the other lever (risky choice) is followed by a larger reward, but only on some of the trials. The overall payoff is the same on both levers. When mice were not food deprived, they were indifferent to risk, choosing both levers with equal probability regardless of the level of risk. In contrast, following food or water deprivation, mice earning 10% sucrose solution were risk-averse, though the addition of alcohol to the sucrose solution dose-dependently reduced risk aversion, even before the mice became intoxicated. Our results falsify the budget rule in optimal foraging theory often used to explain behavior under risk. Instead, they suggest that the overall demand or desired amount for a particular reward determines risk preference. Changes in motivational state or reward identity affect risk preference by changing demand. Any manipulation that increases the demand for a reward also increases risk aversion, by selectively increasing the frequency of safe choices without affecting frequency of risky choices. © 2011 Leblond et al.},

abstract={Explaining the origins of novel traits is central to evolutionary biology. Longstanding theory suggests that developmental plasticity, the ability of an individual to modify its development in response to environmental conditions, might facilitate the evolution of novel traits. Yet whether and how such developmental flexibility promotes innovations that persist over evolutionary time remains unclear. Here, we examine three distinct ways by which developmental plasticity can promote evolutionary innovation. First, we show how the process of genetic accommodation provides a feasible and possibly common avenue by which environmentally induced phenotypes can become subject to heritable modification. Second, we posit that the developmental underpinnings of plasticity increase the degrees of freedom by which environmental and genetic factors influence ontogeny, thereby diversifying targets for evolutionary processes to act on and increasing opportunities for the construction of novel, functional and potentially adaptive phenotypes. Finally, we examine the developmental genetic architectures of environment-dependent trait expression, and highlight their specific implications for the evolutionary origin of novel traits. We critically review the empirical evidence supporting each of these processes, and propose future experiments and tests that would further illuminate the interplay between environmental factors, condition-dependent development, and the initiation and elaboration of novel phenotypes. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

Factor analyses highlighted three main categories of risk reduction strategies consisting of food quality assurance, food avoidance, and animal avoidance. In combination with the fear of contracting avian influenza, mental representations associated with the manifestation and/or transmission of the disease were found to significantly and systematically shape the behavioral responses to the perceived threat.

abstract={Seabirds and large fishes are important top predators in marine ecosystems, but few studies have explored the potential for competition between these groups. This study investigates the relationship between an observed biennial change of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) biomass in the central Bering Sea (23 times greater in odd-numbered than in even-numbered years) and the body condition and diet of the short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris) that spends the post-breeding season there. Samples were collected with research gill nets over seven summers. Both species feed on krill, small fishes and squid. Although the mean pink salmon catch per unit effort (in mass) over the study region was not related significantly with shearwater's stomach content mass or prey composition, the pink salmon biomass showed a negative and significant relationship with the shearwater's body mass and liver mass (proxies of energy reserve). We interpret these results as evidence that fishes can negatively affect mean prey intake of seabirds if they feed on a shared prey in the pelagic ecosystem. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the effects of body condition score to metabolic acclimation in heat stressed Holstein cows. Body condition of cows had no effect on any of the tested parameters during the thermal neutral period, except for the percentage of protein in milk. Heat stress has been demonstrated to have an impact on all the selected parameters, and has been found to be the cause of decreased milk production and quality, increased rectal temperature and respiration rate, decreased glucose, non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and cholesterol concentration, increased urea and bilirubin concentration, and loss of subcutaneous fat. Obese cows (BCS>4) had less ability of acclimation to heat stress as compared to normal and thin cows (significantly lower production and milk quality, and significantly higher rectal temperature and respiration level in relation to the other groups of cows). Obese cows showed a significantly higher concentration of NEFA and significantly lower glucose during exposure to heat stress. The steady increase in NEFA concentrations and decrease of backfat thickness suggested that fat was used for energy purposes, which significantly increased the heat balance and led to poor acclimation to heat stress in obese cows. Cows with high body condition were at higher risk of developing liver failure and lipidosis (reduced cholesterol and elevated bilirubin concentration) during heat stress, which could be linked with increased concentrations of fatty acids in the blood. This was found with an increased concentration of urea during exposure to heat stress, with significantly higher concentration in obese cows. Using the fat for energy purposes depends on the sensitivity to insulin, which increases during heat stress. Obese cows are naturally less sensitive to insulin and more prone to lipolysis. However, these signs should be the focus of future research. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

abstract={Individuals of the same species often exhibit consistent differences in metabolic rate, but the effects of such differences on ecologically important behaviours remain largely unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between metabolic rate and the tendency to take risks while foraging. Individuals with higher metabolic rates may need to take greater risks while foraging to obtain the additional food required to satisfy their energy requirements. Such a relationship could be exacerbated by food deprivation if a higher metabolic demand also causes greater mass loss and hunger. We investigated relationships among metabolic rate, risk-taking and tolerance of food deprivation in juvenile European sea bass. Individual fish were tested for risk-taking behaviours following a simulated predator attack, both before and after a 7-day period of food deprivation. The results were then related to their routine metabolic rate (RMR), which was measured throughout the period of food deprivation. The amount of risk displayed by individual fish before food deprivation showed no relationship with RMR. After food deprivation, however, the amount of risk among individuals was positively correlated with RMR. In general, most fish showed an increase in risk-taking after food deprivation, and the magnitude of the increase in risk-taking was correlated with the rate of individual mass loss during food deprivation, which was itself strongly correlated with RMR. The observation that RMR was related to risk-taking behaviour after food deprivation, but not before, suggests that although RMR can influence risk-taking, the strength of the relationship is flexible and context dependent. The effects of RMR on risk-taking may be subtle or non-existent in regularly feeding animals, but may lead to variability in risk-taking among individuals when food is scarce or supply is unpredictable. This synergistic relationship between RMR and food deprivation could lead to an increased likelihood of being predated for individuals with a relatively high intrinsic energy demand during times when food is scarce. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Objectives: The study was designed to compare effects of food deprivation (FD) and sleep deprivation (SD) on cognition during survival training. Methods: In a cross-over design (n=12), the effects of FD (up to 66 hours followed by 500 kcal intake over 24 hours) and SD (up to 50 hours) on cognitive variables, blood glucose, and 3-OH-butyrate were studied. Results: Food deprivation and SD impaired attention-dependent tasks. The FD impairment of simple reaction time was independent of blood glucose levels, which were normalized by a 500 kcal intake over 24 hours while the reaction time was not. Sleep deprivation and FD impaired maze-solving performance on all variables except rule breaks, which were significantly occurring after 50 hours of SD. Delayed word recall was impaired by SD for 50 hours. On the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, SD was associated with reduced risk-taking. In a gambling task, both SD for 50 hours and FD for 66 hours were associated with a tendency to make early choices when presented with consecutive choices, but the risk-taking was not affected. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation has multiple cognitive effects, including attention, memory, visual-spatial ability, and risk-taking. Food deprivation had no affect on risk-taking, while the other tasks were affected in a way similar to SD but were less pronounced. The FD effects on cognition did not appear to depend on blood sugar levels. The need to sleep should be prioritized in survival situations to avoid cognitive impairment. © 2011 Wilderness Medical Society.},

abstract={This study aimed to identify hungry broiler breeders (n=12) preferences for quantitative (control) or qualitative dietary restriction (QDR) in a closed economy environment. The QDR option was either 3. g calcium propionate/kg total feed (n=6) or 300. g oat hulls/kg total feed (n=6). Quantitatively restricted or QDR portions ensured equal growth regardless of choice. Birds were separately taught a Control diet versus no food and a QDR diet versus no food task to allow each diet's satiating properties to be learnt. Birds had to associate the T-maze coloured arms with dietary outcomes to immediately obtain food. Birds learnt this task easily (p<0.001). A choice between the control diet and the QDR diet was then offered but neither group demonstrated a diet preference. Study modifications demonstrated this was not a failure to discriminate between the diets per se (the Control diet was strongly preferred under ad libitum conditions (p<0.001)) or novel colour combination confusion (the colour associated with food was immediately selected when two novel food versus no food colour combinations were offered (p<0.001)). Most birds still failed to show a significant preference when the Control diet quantity was increased by 50% to make it 'obviously' bigger and better. Therefore, it was concluded that the failure to show a dietary preference was due to task learning failure and not necessarily lack of dietary preference. Where a preference was observed it was always for the control diet. Possible reasons for this failure to learn are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Breeding individuals enter an emergency life-history stage when their body reserves reach a minimum threshold. Consequently, they redirect current activity toward survival, leading to egg abandonment in birds. Corticosterone (CORT) is known to promote this stage. How and to what extent CORT triggers egg abandonment when breeding is associated with prolonged fasting, however, requires further investigation.We manipulated free-living male Adélie penguins with CORT-pellets before their laying period. We then examined their behavioral response with respect to nest abandonment in parallel with their prolactin levels (regulating parental care), and the subsequent effects of treatment on breeding success in relieved birds.Exogenous CORT triggered nest abandonment in 60% of the treated penguins ~. 14. days after treatment and induced a concomitant decline in prolactin levels. Interestingly, prolactin levels in treated penguins that did not abandon their nest were higher at the point of implantation and also after being relieved by females, when compared with abandoning penguins. Among successful birds, the treatment did not affect the number of chicks, nor the brood mass.Our results show the involvement of CORT in the decision-making process regarding egg abandonment in Adélie penguins when incubation is associated with a natural long fast. However, we suggest that CORT alone is not sufficient to trigger nest abandonment but that 1) prolactin levels need to reach a low threshold value, and 2) a rise in proteolysis (i.e. utilization of protein as main energy substrate) seems also to be required. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Winter imposes physiological challenges on individuals including increased thermoregulatory demands, risk of infection, and decreased food availability. To survive these challenges, animals living outside the tropics must appropriately distribute their energetic costs across the year, including reproduction and immune function. Individuals of many species use the annual cycle of changing day lengths (photoperiod), which is encoded by the nightly duration of melatonin secretion, to adjust physiology. Siberian hamsters exposed to short days (SD) (long nights/prolonged endogenous melatonin secretion) enhance some aspects of immune function, but curtail other energetically expensive immune functions including the febrile response. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we determined whether sustained melatonin treatment would inhibit the development of the SD phenotype in female hamsters as it does in males. Second, we examined whether the SD attenuation of fever would be blocked by continuous exposure to exogenous melatonin. Hamsters were implanted with melatonin or empty capsules, housed in either long days (LD) or SD for 8-9 weeks, and then challenged with lipopolysaccharide; body temperature and locomotor activity were recorded. Unlike hamsters with empty capsules, hamsters with melatonin implants did not respond to SD and maintained a LD phenotype including summer-like spleen, uterine and body masses, and pelage characteristics. Further, sustained melatonin treatment blocked the SD attenuation of febrile responses and prolonged the behavioral components of the sickness response. These results suggest that the daily fluctuations in endogenous melatonin may be masked by continuous exposure to exogenous melatonin, thus inhibiting functional photoperiodic responses to SD. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={Ecological theory suggests that the behaviour, growth and abundance of predators will be strongly influenced by the abundance of prey. Predators may in turn play an important role in structuring prey populations and communities. Responses of predators to variation in prey abundance have most commonly been demonstrated in low-diversity communities where food webs are relatively simple. How predators respond in highly diverse assemblages such as in coral reef habitats is largely unknown. This study describes an experiment that examined how the movement, diet and growth of the coral reef piscivore, Cephalopholis boenak (Serranidae) responded to variation in the abundance of its prey. Predator densities were standardised on small patch reefs made from the lagoonal reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica. These patch reefs exhibited natural variation in the abundance and community structure of multiple species of prey. However, our experiment generated a relatively simple predator-prey relationship, with C. boenak primarily responding to the most abundant species of prey. Three responses of predators were observed: aggregative, functional and developmental. Thirty-one per cent of individuals moved between patch reefs during the experiment, all from areas of relatively low to high prey density. Feeding rates were higher on patch reefs of high prey density, while growth rates of fish that remained on low prey density reefs throughout the experiment were lower. Growth rates of C. boenak on the experimental reefs were also much higher than for those living on natural patch reefs over the same time period, corresponding with overall differences in prey abundance. These results suggest that local abundance, feeding rate and growth of C. boenak were closely linked to the abundance of their main prey. This combination of predatory responses is a potential mechanism behind recent observations of density-dependent mortality and population regulation of prey in coral reef fish communities. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Individuals should benefit from settling in high-quality habitats, but dispersers born under favourable conditions have a better physical condition and should therefore be more successful at settling in high-quality habitats. We tested these predictions with root voles (Microtus oeconomus) by a manipulation of individual condition through litter-size enlargement and reduction during lactation combined with a manipulation of habitat quality through degradation of the vegetation cover. We accurately monitored movements of 149 juveniles during a settlement and breeding period of 3months. The litter size treatment had long-lasting effects on body size, life-history traits and home range size, but did not influence dispersal behaviour. Different stages of dispersal were influenced by habitat quality. In low-quality patches, females dispersed earlier, spent more time prospecting their environment before settling, and settlers had a smaller adult body size than in high-quality patches. Preference and competition for high-quality patches is likely adaptive as it increased fitness both in terms of survival and reproduction. We found no interactive effect of individual condition and habitat quality on natal dispersal and habitat selection. These findings suggest that immediate conditions are more important determinants of dispersal decisions than conditions experienced early in life. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={1.Predators can reduce herbivory and increase plant biomass by consuming herbivores, lowering individual herbivore feeding rates, or both. We tested whether the presence of predators increases plant quality by non-consumptively reducing grazing pressure and thereby weakening the strength of the induced response in plant chemical defences. 2.We performed a 42-day outdoor mesocosm experiment in which the herbivorous amphipod Ampithoe longimana was cultured on the brown seaweed Sargassum filipendula in the presence and absence of olfactory cues of its principal fish predator, the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. The presence of fish cues reduced per capita rates of amphipod grazing by nearly 50%. Over the span of the mesocosm experiment, this per capita reduction in feeding rate yielded at least a 40% lower growth rate of amphipod populations (i.e. r reduced from 1.01 to 0.61). The lower rates of amphipod grazing (overall or per capita) correlated with higher algal biomass. 3.We pursued a series of laboratory-based feeding choice assays with naïve amphipods to determine tissue palatability and the plant traits that mediate feeding choices. Tissue from tanks without grazers was more palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers, a pattern of induced plant defences that has been documented previously. Surprisingly, however, plant tissue from tanks with grazers and fish cues was more palatable than tissue from tanks with grazers but without fish cues. All changes in algal palatability were mediated by polar, but not lipophilic metabolites. These results suggest that the non-consumptive effects of fish predators increases the food quality of Sargassum by weakening the strength of its induced chemical defences. 4. Synthesis. The smell of predators has the potential to regulate herbivore populations and affect the ecological dynamics of plant biomass and chemical defences. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Experimental studies in temperate regions have revealed that competition and predation interact to shape aquatic communities. Predators typically reduce the effect of competition on growth and competitors provide alternative prey subjects, which may also alter predation. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of competition and predation on the survival and growth of hatchling tadpoles of two widespread co-occurring Neotropical hylid frogs (Agalychnis callidryas and Dendropsophus ebraccatus). Using 400L mesocosms, we used a 2 × 3 factorial substitutive design, which crossed tadpole species composition with the presence or absence of a free-roaming predator (Anax amazili dragonfly larva). Dragonflies were effective predators of both species, but had larger effects on A. callidryas survival. Both species had similar growth rates when alone, whereas A. callidryas grew 30 percent faster than D. ebraccatus when they co-occurred, suggesting interspecific rather than intraspecific competition had relatively stronger effects on D. ebraccatus growth, while the opposite was true for A. callidryas. Predator presence dramatically reduced growth rates of both species and erased this asymmetry. Results suggest that the effects of predator induction (i.e., nonconsumptive effects) on growth were larger than both consumptive and competitive effects. Our study demonstrates that predators have strong effects on both survival and growth of prey, highlighting the potential importance of predators in shaping prey populations and tropical aquatic food web interactions.

abstract={Dispersal is a key process in population biology and ecology. Although the general ecological conditions that lead to dispersal have been well studied, the causes of individual variation in dispersal are less well understood. A number of recent studies suggest that heritable temperament - or personality - traits are correlated with dispersal in the wild but the extent to which these 'personality-dispersal syndromes' are general, how they depend on an individual's state and on spatial scale and whether they are temporally stable, both within and across individuals, remains unclear. Here, we examine the relationship between exploration behaviour - an axis of personality that appears to be important in animals generally - and a variety of dispersal processes over 6years in a population of the great tit Parus major. Exploration behaviour was higher in immigrant than in locally born juveniles, but the difference was much larger for individuals with a small body mass, though independent of sex, representing one of the first examples of a state-dependent effect in a personality-dispersal syndrome. Despite a temporal trend in exploration behaviour at the population level, the difference between immigrants and locally born birds remained stable over time, both across and within individuals. This suggests that the personality difference between immigrants and locally born birds is established early in development, but that the process of immigration interacts with both personality and state. We found that the number of immigrant parents a locally born bird had did not influence exploration behaviour, suggesting either the difference between immigrants and residents was environmental or that the effect is overridden by local environmental sources of variation. In contrast to previous work, we found no evidence for links between personality and natal dispersal distance within the population, either in terms of an individual's own exploration behaviour or that of its parents. Our results suggest that there are links between individual differences in personality and dispersal, but that these can be dependent on differences in state among individuals and on the scale over which dispersal is measured. Future work should aim to understand the differences between dispersal within and between populations and the ways in which personality and state interact to determine the outcome of these processes. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Responses to innocuous stimuli often habituate with repeated stimulation, but the mechanisms involved in dishabituation are less well studied. Chan et al. (2010b) found that hermit crabs were quicker to perform an anti-predator withdrawal response in the presence of a short-duration white noise relative to a longer noise stimulus. In two experiments, we examined whether this effect could be explicable in terms of a non-associative learning process. We delivered repeated presentations of a simulated visual predator to hermit crabs, which initially caused the crabs to withdraw into their shells. After a number of trials, the visual stimulus lost the ability to elicit the withdrawal response. We then presented the crabs with an auditory stimulus prior to an additional presentation of the visual predator. In Experiment 1, the presentation of a 10-s, 89-dB SPL noise produced no significant dishabituation of the response. In Experiment 2 we increased the duration (50. s) and intensity (95. dB) of the noise, and found that the crabs recovered their withdrawal response to the visual predator. This finding illustrates dishabituation of an antipredator response and suggests two distinct processes-distraction and sensitization-are influenced by the same stimulus parameters, and interact to modulate the strength of the anti-predator response. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is well known that nutritional status during the fetal and/or lactation period is important for the development of the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, the effect of malnutrition on postweaning development has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the behavioral and neuroanatomical effects of protein malnutrition (PM) postweaning in mice. Starting at 20-21 d of age, male ddY mice were maintained on a 5% casein diet (PM group) or 20% casein diet (control group) for 20 d. On the 20th d, body and brain weights of PM mice were lower than those of the control group. PM mice exhibited excessive alertness and spontaneous activity under novel conditions in the Irwin test. In addition, PM mice showed increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze compared to control mice. These results suggest that hyperactivity and reduced anxiety behavior or higher impulsiveness in PM mice could be due to an immature brain. © 2011 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.},

abstract={Risk-sensitive foraging theory (RSFT) was developed to explain a choice between a variable (risk-prone) or constant (risk-averse) option. In the RSFT literature, qualitative shifts in risk-sensitivity have been explained by fluctuations in daily caloric energy budget (DEB). The DEB rule describes foragers' choices as being based on fitness and rate of gain. If the DEB rule is correct, rewards that differ in caloric returns should cause differences in foragers' sensitivity to risk. However, few studies have explored the influence of reward quality on risk-sensitivity in mammals. The present study was designed to examine the effects of reward quality on risk-sensitivity when reward magnitude, delay to reward, body mass, and response effort were controlled. Results from the current study demonstrated that subjects rewarded with a high calorie reward (i.e., sugar) made significantly fewer choices for a variable option than subjects rewarded with a lower calorie reward (i.e., grain). These results are consistent with the predictions of the DEB rule, and add to the RSFT literature where reward quality was manipulated by describing difference in risk-sensitivity in mammals. Suggestions for future research include an examination of risk-sensitivity where flavor and caloric return are manipulated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Understanding how genes and the environment interact to shape phenotypes is of fundamental importance for resolving important issues in adaptive evolution. Yet, for most model species with mature genetics and accessible genomic resources, we know little about the natural environmental factors that shape their evolution. By contrast, animal species with deeply understood ecologies and well characterized responses to environmental cues are rarely subjects of genomic investigations. Here, we preview advances in genomics in aphids and waterfleas that may help transform research on the regulatory mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity. This insect and crustacean duo has the capacity to produce extremely divergent phenotypes in response to environmental stimuli. Sexual fate and reproductive mode are condition-dependent in both groups, which are also capable of altering morphology, physiology and behavior in response to biotic and abiotic cues. Recently, the genome sequences for the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum and the waterflea Daphnia pulex were described by their respective research communities. We propose that an integrative study of genome biology focused on the condition-dependent transcriptional basis of their shared plastic traits and specialized mode of reproduction will provide broad insight into adaptive plasticity and genome by environment interactions. We highlight recent advances in understanding the genome regulation of alternative phenotypes and environmental cue processing, and we propose future research avenues to discover gene networks and epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity.

abstract={The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-containing neurones within the lateral hypothalamus integrate nutritional, energetic and behavioural cues to generate the final output in order to exert their functions. It is still not clear how Hcrt neurones monitor changes in energy status in animals. In brain slices from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) exclusively in Hcrt neurones, we examined the roles of intracellular levels of ATP ([ATP]i) in regulating activities in these cells with conventional and perforated whole-cell recording. By using 'ATP clamp' we demonstrated that membrane potential (Vm) correlated with the [ATP]i in Hcrt neurones. Perforated recording revealed a Vm of -46.1 ± 1.6 mV (n= 18), close to the level measured with an [ATP]i equal to 5-6 mm (-48.7 ± 1.4 mV, n= 16, 5 mm ATP), suggesting that a unique demand for energy is required to maintain normal functionality in Hcrt cells. A direct disruption of ATP production or reduction in ambient glucose levels resulted in an inhibition of activity in Hcrt neurones. The Vm was significantly depolarized in Hcrt neurones in sleep-deprived mice as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.01, t test), which was eliminated by experimental manipulations causing the same level of [ATP]i and KATP channel opening in both groups, suggesting a decrease during sleep and an increase during sustained wakefulness in [ATP]i in Hcrt cells. In summary, these data demonstrate that a delicate control of activity by monitoring the availability of intracellular energy stores in Hcrt cells may serve as a novel mechanism regulating energy expenditure and behavioural state dependent upon the energy state in animals. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={In many animals, females are fed by males during courtship or incubation (mate-feeding). According to the mate appraisal hypothesis, females may evaluate the parental capacity of males, whereas the pair bond hypothesis suggests that feeding may strengthen the pair bonds with them. Following the nutrition hypothesis, by contrast, females obtain direct nutritional benefits from being fed by males during periods of high-energy expenditure, such as egg formation and incubation. However, there is little support for these hypotheses at an interspecific level. We tested predictions from these hypotheses in a dataset of 170 species of passerine birds. As predicted by the nutrition hypothesis, we found that mate-feeding has evolved more often in species in which the female incubates and builds the nest alone and have noncarnivorous diets. This suggests that mate-feeding is a behavioral strategy that compensates for nutritional limitations of females during breeding, as both incubation and nest building are energetically costly processes, and noncarnivorous diets are deficient in proteins. We also found that incubation feeding has evolved more often in species that place nests at elevated sites, suggesting that these species face low predation risk that allows males to feed females. In the particular case of incubation feeding, we found that species that have evolved this behavior produce larger clutch size and have higher hatching success. Our results support the nutrition hypothesis from an interspecific perspective, suggesting that mate-feeding is a strategy to compensate for nutritional limitations of females during reproduction and that it has fitness consequences. © 2011 The Author.},

abstract={The objectives of this study were to investigate 1) the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and methods for alleviation of menopausal symptoms, 2) the consumption behavior and needs of menopausal women, and 3) the factors influencing a consumer' s buying decision on soy and soy germ products. The research was undertaken by collecting data from various sources and interviews with questionnaires of 402 menopausal women aged between 40 and 59 years. The result showed that the five most common symptoms were tiredness (81.1%), forgetfulness (77.6%), dry skin (75.4%), headache (72.9%), and aching in muscles and joints (70.1%). Most respondents alleviated menopausal symptoms by exercising the body and brain (54.5%) and eating phytoestrogen products (30.1%). The top five soy products usually consumed by respondents were 1) pasteurized or UHT soymilk (85.8%), 2) soft/silk tofu (68.4%), 3) tofu milk (57.0%), 4) tofu with ginger syrup (55.7%), and 5) firm tofu (48.0%). The respondents consumed soy and soy germ products 1-2 times per week (37.1%) and normally purchased from markets or open markets (87.1%). The reasons given for consuming soy and soy germ products were nutrition value and medicinal properties. The respondents rated the importance levels of eleven variables influencing a consumer' s buying decision. Meanwhile, a factor analysis technique classified these variables into four factors which in total explained a cumulative variance of 67.37 percent. The four factors were 1) a product and price factor, describing product appearance, taste and price; 2) a marketing factor describing brand, convenient buying and advertising; 3) a package factor describing packaging and the size of the package; and 4) a health factor describing nutrition value, medicinal properties and product safety. This exploratory study was conducted to get a better understanding of menopausal women' s behavior. For the development of soy germ products, the respondents were interested in soy germ products containing isoflavones (87.6%). They suggested that soy germ products should be developed in a beverage category (57.7%) and a supplementary food category (25.3%).},

abstract={Climate change modelers predict increasingly frequent ''extreme events,'' so it is critical to quantify whether organismal responses (such as reproductive output) measured over the range of usual climatic conditions can predict responses under more extreme conditions. In a 20-year field study on water pythons (Liasis fuscus), we quantified the effects of climatically driven annual variation in food supply on demographic traits of female pythons (feeding rate, body size, body mass, and reproductive output). Reaction norms linking food supply to feeding rates and residual body mass were broadly linear, whereas norms linking food supply to female body size became curvilinear when a dramatic (flooding-induced) famine reduced the mean body size at sexual maturity. Thus, the reaction norms recorded over 16 years of ''normal'' (albeit highly variable) climatic conditions gave little insight into the population's response to a more extreme nutritional crisis. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={In mating systems with social monogamy and obligatory bi-parental care, such as found in many songbird species, male and female fitness depends on the combined parental investment. Hence, both sexes should gain from choosing mates in high rather than low condition. However, theory also predicts that an individual's phenotypic quality can constrain choice, if low condition individuals cannot afford prolonged search efforts and/or face higher risk of rejection. In systems with mutual mate choice, the interaction between male and female condition should thus be a better predictor of choice than either factor in isolation. To address this prediction experimentally, we manipulated male and female condition and subsequently tested male and female mating preferences in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, a songbird species with mutual mate choice and obligatory bi-parental care. We experimentally altered phenotypic quality by manipulating the brood size in which the birds were reared. Patterns of association for high- or low-condition individuals of the opposite sex differed for male and female focal birds when tested in an 8-way choice arena. Females showed repeatable condition-assortative preferences for males matching their own rearing background. Male preferences were also repeatable, but not predicted by their own or females' rearing background. In combination with a brief review of the literature on condition-dependent mate choice in the zebra finch we discuss whether the observed sex differences and between-studies differences arise because males and females differ in context sensitivity (e.g. male-male competition suppressing male mating preferences), sampling strategies or susceptibility to rearing conditions (e.g. sex-specific effect on physiology). While a picture emerges that juvenile and current state indeed affect preferences, the development and context-dependency of mutual state-dependent mate choice warrants further study. © 2011 Holveck et al.},

abstract={Background: Recent studies in rodents and humans suggest that the chemoreception of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in oral cavity is involved in the spontaneous preference for fatty foods and might contribute to the obesity risk. CD36 and GPR120 are LCFA receptors identified in rodent taste bud cells. The fact that CD36 or GPR120 gene inactivation leads to a decrease in the preference for lipids raises the question of the respective role(s) played by these gustatory lipid-sensor candidates. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a combination of biochemical, nutritional and behavioural studies in wild-type, CD36 +/-and CD36 -/- mice, it was found that: 1°) CD36 and GPR120 display different diurnal rhythms in the gustatory circumvallate papillae, CD36 mRNA levels being down-regulated during the dark period in contrast to GPR120, 2°) this change is due to food intake and strictly dependent of the presence of lipids in the diet, 3°) CD36 protein levels are also rapidly but transiently decreased by the food intake, a two-fold drop in CD36 protein levels being found 1 h after refeeding, followed by a progressive return to the pre-prandial values, 4°) this down-regulation, which has a post-transcriptional origin, seems sufficient to alter the spontaneous fat preference, independently to change in the GPR120 gene expression. Conclusions/Significance: In contrast to GPR120, CD36 appears to be a food-sensitive lipid sensor in the gustatory circumvallate papillae. Lipid-mediated change in lingual CD36 expression might modulate the motivation for fat during a meal, initially high and then gradually decreasing secondary to the food intake. This short-term lipid-mediated effect is reminiscent of sensory-specific satiety. These findings, which highlight the role played by CD36 in the oro-sensory perception of dietary lipids, raise the possibility of novel pharmacological strategies to modify attraction for fatty foods and decrease obesity risks. © 2011 Martin et al.},

abstract={Rats that exhibit a behaviorally inhibited temperament acquire active-avoidance behaviors quicker, and extinguish them slower, than normal outbred rats. Here we explored the contribution of stimuli that signal periods of non-threat (i.e. safety signals) in the process of acquiring active-avoidance behavior. Utilizing a discrete lever-press escape-avoidance protocol, outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and inbred, behaviorally inhibited, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were tested under conditions where a flashing light was either presented or not during periods of non-threat (the inter-trial interval, ITI). For males, we found the absence of the ITI-signal slowed the acquisition of avoidance behavior selectively in WKY rats. However, extinction of the avoidance behavior was not influenced by training with or without the ITI-signal; WKY males extinguished slower than SD males. For females, the presence of the ITI-signal did not affect acquisition in either strain. However, after training with the ITI-signal, females of both strains extinguished quicker in its absence than in its presence. In order to determine if facilitated acquisition of avoidance learning in male WKY rats was due to a paradigm-independent influence of the visual stimulus used as ITI-signal upon associative learning, we conducted eyeblink conditioning in the presence or absence of a similar visual stimulus. No differences in acquisition, as a function of this visual stimulus, were observed within the male WKY rats, but, as was observed in avoidance learning, male WKY rats extinguished slower than male SD rats. Thus, avoidance susceptibility for male WKY rats may be tied both to the presence of non-threat signals as well as a resistance to extinguish Pavlovian-conditioned associations. Female susceptibility to resist extinguishing avoidant behavior is discussed with respect to the possible role of stimuli serving as occasion setters for threat contexts. © 2011.},

abstract={Compared to Europe's mean immigrant contingent of 7.3 to 8.6% Switzerland holds the highest contingent of foreign population with 23.5%. Therefore it is of utmost importance that physicians have a knowledge of the specific characteristics of immigrant patients. The influence of personality factors (experience, behavior) is not independent from the influence of culturallyrelated environmental factors (regional differences in diet, pollutants, meanings, etc.). In addition, differentcultural groups rate their quality of life differently. Psychological reasons for recurrent abdominal pain are stress (life events), effects of self-medication (laxatives, cocaine) and sexual abuse but also rare infectious diseases are more common among immigrants (e.g. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, etc.). Migration-specific characteristics are mainly to find in the semiotics of the symptoms: not every abdominal pain is real pain in the abdomen. Finally, it is crucial to make the distinction between organic, functional and psychological- related pain. This can, however, usually only be accomplished in the context of the entire situation of a patient and, depending on the situation, with the support of a colleague from the appropriate cultural group or an experienced interpreter. In this review we limit ourselves to the presentation of the working population of the migrants, because these represent the largest group of all migrants. The specific situation of asylum seekers will also be refrained to where appropriate. © 2011 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.},

abstract={Human beings have a natural resistance to think about their old age, both personally and professionally. Governments have targeted efforts to successfully prolong the life of the population, situation which already is a social and economic problem. "Old is a person with physical, intellectual and emotional limitations, who has a reduced autonomy and welfare, as a result of the years lived". Not everyone ages at the same age; it will depend on health, habits, physical and intellectual activity, nutritional status, vices and attitude towards life. A physician may decide not to continue exercising medicine due to: health problems, because they do not want to, because they do not feel competent, because of the risk of having to deal with a complaint or a lawsuit, to have a new life project, or because they have no patients. The options available for a doctor at the time of retirement will depend on his/her age, health status, stage of the aging process: autonomy, dependency or old age; his/her physical and mental condition, professional development, economic situation and family environment. A doctor may remain independent, join another family or seek shelter in a retirement home.},

abstract={Early life stressors in rodents, including maternal separation and social isolation, have been shown to disrupt brain development and profoundly affect a wide-range of behaviors in adult animals. In this study, we focus on the development of female Sprague-Dawley rats in the presence and absence of conspecifics during the critical period of social play. Similar studies in male rodents have shown that this form of social deprivation results in dysregulated dopaminergic and serotonergic functions in the brain with core features of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety disorder and schizophrenia. Here we examined the behavioral and biochemical effects of post-weaning social isolation in female rats. Our findings demonstrated that isolation rearing produced marked deficits in social interaction behaviors and increased anxiety in open-field and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. The expression of synaptic-associated proteins PSD95 and synapsin I as well as glutamate receptors subunits GluR1 and NR1 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were significantly reduced in isolation-reared female rats. Current findings provide evidence that in female rats, post-weaning environmental disruption can result in profound dysregulation of synapse-related proteins and behavior. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Animals living in thermally stressful environments exhibit morphological, physiological and behavioral adjustments to regulate the thermal balance. The insulation of pelage can retard or enhance heat loss. Pelage structure and color are factors that contribute to regulation of heat transfer. We review the heat transfer properties of mammalian pelage and the factors that influence rates of transfer. Heat transfer through pelage occurs as a result of thermal transduction, convection and radiation. Each of these processes is affected by wind, temperature, moisture and solar radiation. Wind has a strong influence on convection. When hair is separated or compressed by wind, the thermal insulation of pelage is lower than in still air. Wind speed is positively correlated with the amount of heat loss. At high wind speeds, the relationship between hydrodynamic parameters and heat loss cannot be accurately defined. However, thermal conductance can be estimated from cooling curves in still air adjusted for different wind speeds. Body orientation relative to wind direction also affects the heat loss rate due to the direction of hair growth: animals facing toward the wind have lower insulation than back to the wind. The differential between an animal's body temperature and the surrounding air temperature is another influencing factor, heat loss increases with increasing differentials. Animals show higher sensitivity to temperature change when hair is lacking. Animals adapt to environmental temperatures through evolutionary changes in their pelage structure that avoid the need for increased energy expenditure. In cold environments well-insulated mammals have more latitude in habitat selection and behavior than do poorly insulated mammals. Moisture also affects thermal conduction of pelage. Increasing pelage humidity increase the heat loss by thermal conductive and evaporative cooling. Because water has a thermal coefficient 23. 1 times higher than air, wet pelage loses heat about 3 times faster than dry pelage. Apart from this, the distribution pattern, quantity, and secretion capacity of sweat glands are additional factors influencing pelage insulation. Animals optimize their pelage humidity through behavioral regulation and pelage structure. Solar radiation can compensate animal body heat loss. Pelage color determines the capacity for absorbance and reflection of radiant heat, with darker pelage absorbing more solar heat but with lower penetrability than lighter pelage. Solar heat gain is a potentially important factor in the energy budget of diurnal mammals. This may be significant for mammals feeding on poor quality food with low energy density and variable availability. In conclusion, heat transfer capability directly links animal physiology with environmental factors, which is important for understanding the mechanisms of adaptation and evolution. Variations in heat transfer of pelage suggest that knowledge of pelage structure and physiological properties may also facilitate bionic exploration. We recommend continued research concentration on the structure and physiology of pelage and development of supporting technology, especially on bionic significance and applications.},

abstract={Animals adjust their antipredator behavior according to environmental variation in risk, and to account for their ability to respond to threats. Intrinsic factors that influence an animal's ability to respond to predators (e. g., age, body condition) should explain variation in antipredator behavior. For example, a juvenile might allocate more time to vigilance than an adult because mortality as a result of predation is often high for this age class; however, the relationship between age/vulnerability and antipredator behavior is not always clear or as predicted. We explored the influence of intrinsic factors on yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) antipredator behavior using data pooled from 4 years of experiments. We hypothesized that inherently vulnerable animals (e.g., young, males, and individuals in poor condition) would exhibit more antipredator behavior prior to and immediately following conspecific alarm calls. As expected, males and yearlings suppressed foraging more than females and adults following alarm call playbacks. In contrast to predictions, animals in better condition respond more than animals in below average condition. Interestingly, these intrinsic properties did not influence baseline time budgets; animals of all ages, sexes, and condition levels devoted comparable amounts of time to foraging prior to alarm calls. Our results support the hypothesis that inherent differences in vulnerability influence antipredator behavior; furthermore, it appears that a crucial, but poorly acknowledged, interaction exists between risk and state-dependence. Elevated risk may be required to reveal the workings of state-dependent behavior, and studies of antipredator behavior in a single context may draw incomplete conclusions about age- or sex-specific strategies. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={Enrichment aims to improve captive animals' welfare by enhancing their environments. Two of the struggles associated with measuring welfare are identifying when animals' needs are being met or surpassed and identifying how individual differences play a role in these outcomes. Using a group of related Guyanese squirrel monkeys, we studied changes in five welfare indicators under different environmental conditions. Manipulating food presentation, walkways, and toys, we created five enrichment levels ranging from just above USDA standards to considerably more complex than the animals' normal housing. At the end of each level, a novelty test was performed in which an unfamiliar woman entered the enclosure and offered food. Changes in behavior as a function of enrichment condition were analyzed using a repeated-measures MANOVA. Compared to baseline, less enrichment consistently increased negative welfare indicators (abnormal behavior, aggression, and negative responses to the novelty test), while more enrichment sometimes decreased these indicators. Positive welfare indicators were less consistently related to enrichment, but positive response to the novelty test did increase somewhat in the most enriched condition. Across conditions, rank correlations revealed that individuals had highly consistent individual differences in positive responses to novelty and somewhat consistent individual differences in rates of aggression. The goal of the enrichment and the species, sex, and individual animals to be enriched should be considered when selecting a welfare indicator, and facilities measuring animal welfare should study changes in the behavior of specific individuals to control for individual differences. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={The neuroimmunological and behavioral consequences of a high-fat diet (HFD) are not well delineated. This is especially true when short term (24 h) fasting is used as a physiologic stressor. In this study, we examined the impact of a HFD on learning and memory and depressive-like behaviors to understand how fasting impacts neuroimmunity and whether obesity modulates the response. Mice were fed diets containing either 10% (low-fat diet (LFD) mice) or 60% (HFD mice) calories from fat for 10-12 weeks. Gene transcripts for 26 pro-/anti- inflammatory cytokines and markers of macrophage activation were examined in adipose tissue and whole brain. Mouse learning and memory (spontaneous alternation, novel object) and depressive-like behaviors (saccharin preference, burrowing, forced swim) were studied in the fed and fasted state as were gene transcripts for F4/80, CD11b, interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1Β, IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-1RA, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. In the fed state, HFD mice compared to LFD mice had reduced locomotor activity, and were adverse to saccharin and burrowed less. After fasting, LFD mice vs. HFD mice lost 18 vs. 5% of their body weight, respectively. In addition, HFD mice failed to downregulate gene transcripts for the myeloid-cell associated proteins F4/80, CD11b and IL-1α in the brain, failed to appropriately explore a novel object, failed to reduce locomotor activity and had increased saccharin consumption and burrowing. These data indicate that fasting induces an anti-inflammatory effect on the neuroimmune system which a HFD prevents. This breakdown appears linked to the IL-1 system because of the association of this cytokine with memory and learning. © 2011 The Obesity Society.},

abstract={The contributions of genetic risk factors to susceptibility for brain disorders are often so closely intertwined with environmental factors that studying genes in isolation cannot provide the full picture of pathogenesis. With recent advances in our understanding of psychiatric genetics and environmental modifiers we are now in a position to develop more accurate animal models of psychiatric disorders which exemplify the complex interaction of genes and environment. Here, we consider some of the insights that have emerged from studying the relationship between defined genetic alterations and environmental factors in rodent models. A key issue in such animal models is the optimization of construct validity, at both genetic and environmental levels. Standard housing of laboratory mice and rats generally includes ad libitum food access and limited opportunity for physical exercise, leading to metabolic dysfunction under control conditions, and thus reducing validity of animal models with respect to clinical populations. A related issue, of specific relevance to neuroscientists, is that most standard-housed rodents have limited opportunity for sensory and cognitive stimulation, which in turn provides reduced incentive for complex motor activity. Decades of research using environmental enrichment has demonstrated beneficial effects on brain and behavior in both wild-type and genetically modified rodent models, relative to standard-housed littermate controls. One interpretation of such studies is that environmentally enriched animals more closely approximate average human levels of cognitive and sensorimotor stimulation, whereas the standard housing currently used in most laboratories models a more sedentary state of reduced mental and physical activity and abnormal stress levels. The use of such standard housing as a single environmental variable may limit the capacity for preclinical models to translate into successful clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need to optimize 'environmental construct validity' in animal models, while maintaining comparability between laboratories, so as to ensure optimal scientific and medical outcomes. Utilizing more sophisticated models to elucidate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors will allow for improved construct, face and predictive validity, thus facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Visitors are known to affect zoo animals, and such effects may be stressful, neutral, or enriching. The majority of research has focused on visitor number or visitor presence-absence, yet few studies have examined effects of other variables such as sound volume, visitor activity, and whether visitors interact with animals. In this study, the effects of visitor number, activity and proximity to animals were investigated on a group of captive orangutans in two treetop, 'free-ranging' exhibits at Singapore Zoo. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to elucidate the relationships between visitor and orangutan behaviours. Results from these analyses revealed a significant overall effect of the three visitor variables on orangutan behaviour. Interestingly, visitor number had little effect on the orangutans, except at one of the exhibits where the likelihood of food soliciting and looking at visitors increased when the number of people numbered more than 40. Visitor activity was generally not associated with any obvious signs of stress in the orangutans; visitors with food could even be a form of enrichment. However, visitors at close proximity decreased play behaviour and increased the chances of animals looking at the visitors. Enclosure design and habituation could have alleviated visitor effects for these two groups of orangutans. This study shows how investigation of a wider range of visitor variables may allow for more meaningful conclusions about the visitor effect, and that other factors such as enclosure design and habituation to visitors may also influence captive animal welfare. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The bioindicator notion is an appealing concept that has received more support in applied than in basic ecology, mostly due to the difficulty in deriving general ecological rules applicable to all target organisms. However, recognizing the mechanisms that determine the association between a particular species and the well-being of many other species is important for understanding the functioning of ecosystems and the relationship among different biological levels. We examined here the processes at the individual level that cause an association between species performance and biodiversity value, by analyzing attributes that can be studied in a variety of animals with sexual reproduction, namely breeding site selection and condition-dependent sexual signals. Our study model was the Capercaillie, an indicator of forest functioning and diversity, and the associated bird community, used here as a surrogate of broader forest biodiversity. At a regional scale Capercaillie occurrence was not associated with the most diverse forest patches, but at the scale of male spring territories the sexual display grounds (arenas) were located in the oldest and less disturbed forest portions, which also hosted the richest local bird communities. Social mechanisms and conspecific cueing likely concurred with habitat-driven processes in determining the long-term persistence of traditional display grounds, which were appealing to many other species because of their structural composition. Characteristics of male vocal display that honestly advertize male quality (low frequencies and rapid song rates) were significantly correlated with high diversity values, resulting in a spatial association between individual and community performances. Costly or risky activities such as reproductive or social behaviors, which more than other attributes match gradients in habitat quality, are therefore contributing to functionally connect individuals with ecosystem health. © 2011 Laiolo et al.},

abstract={Male mate choice is predicted to evolve as male investment in mating increases. Thus, taxa in which males pay a high cost for mating offer researchers an ideal system to test traditional sex roles. Males courting potentially sexually cannibalistic females may be under strong selection to bias their courtship efforts away from hungry females that may be more likely to attack. Here we tested the prediction that web-based chemotactile cues of recent female foraging success influence male courtship in the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus. In addition, we tested the underlying assumption that previous female foraging success reduces precopulatory sexually cannibalistic attacks. We found that males courted well-fed females significantly more than they did starved females, and that this bias was maintained in the absence of the female when males encountered only (1) cues from female webs and (2) cues from female silk after web architecture had been eliminated. A nonsignificant courtship bias in favour of well-fed females was also evident when these females were transplanted to the webs of starved females. Male courtship biases in favour of well-fed females appear adaptive, as starved females were significantly more likely to attack males before mating. We conclude by noting that sexual cannibalism offers a model system wherein the exploitation of cues of predation risk have unique implications such as the effects on male courtship preferences seen here. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Here, we investigated the interaction between nutrient-induced gut-brain signaling and sad emotion induced by musical and visual cues at the behavioral and neural level in healthy nonobese subjects undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects received an intragastric infusion of fatty acid solution or saline during neutral or sad emotion induction and rated sensations of hunger, fullness, and mood. We found an interaction between fatty acid infusion and emotion induction both in the behavioral readouts (hunger, mood) and at the level of neural activity in multiple pre-hypothesized regions of interest. Specifically, the behavioral and neural responses to sad emotion induction were attenuated by fatty acid infusion. These findings increase our understanding of the interplay among emotions, hunger, food intake, and meal-induced sensations in health, which may have important implications for a wide range of disorders, including obesity, eating disorders, and depression.},

abstract={Knowledge of the hormonal pathway controlling genotype-specific norms of reaction would shed light on the ecological factors to which each genotype is adapted. Environmentally mediated changes in the sign and magnitude of covariations between heritable melanin-based colouration and fitness components are frequent, revealing that extreme melanin-based phenotypes can display different physiological states depending on the environment. Yet, the hormonal mechanism underlying this phenomenon is poorly understood. One novel hypothesis proposes that these covariations stem from pleiotropic effects of the melanocortin system. Melanocortins are post-translationally modified bioactive peptides derived from the POMC prohormone that are involved in melanogenesis, anti-inflammation, energy homeostasis and stress responses. Thus, differential regulation of fitness components in relation to environmental factors by pale and dark melanic individuals may be due to colour-specific regulation of the POMC prohormone. Accordingly, we found that the degree of reddish melanic colouration was negatively correlated with blood circulating levels of the POMC prohormone in female tawny owls (Strix aluco) rearing a brood for which the size was experimentally reduced, but not when enlarged, and in females located in rich but not in poor territories. Our findings support the hypothesis that the widespread links between melanin-based colouration and fitness components may be mediated, at least in part, by the melanocortin system. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, constitute the main cause of death worldwide. Eighty percent of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, especially as these countries undergo socio-economic improvement following reductions in the burden of infectious disease. The World Health Organization predicts a substantial increase in the incidence of NCDs over the next decade globally. NCDs are generally preventable, but current approaches are clearly inadequate. New initiatives are needed to implement such prevention, and there needs to be greater recognition that early-life interventions are likely to be the most efficacious. Devising appropriate prevention strategies necessitates an understanding of how the developmental environment influences risk. Progress in this field has been slow due to an excessive emphasis on fixed genomic variations (hard inheritance) as the major determinants of disease susceptibility. However, new evidence demonstrates the much greater importance of early-life developmental factors, involving epigenetic processes and 'soft' inheritance in modulating an individual's vulnerability to NCD. This also offers opportunities for novel epigenetic biomarkers of risk or interventions targeting epigenetic pathways to be devised for use in early life. This may pave the way to much more effective, customised interventions to promote health across the life course. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Introduction: The connection between the human psyche and physical health was observed as early as at the dawn of time. Alarming statistics on cardiovascular disease epidemiology force scientists to thoroughly analyse the risk factors, including psychosocial factors. Among the psychosocial factors playing a significant role in the development of cardiovascular diseases are type A personality pattern and chronic stress. Literature more and more frequently points to the growing significance of health behavior in the development of cardiovascular risk. Aim of the study: The assessment of selected psychosocial factors to the prevalence of type A personality traits predisposing to the development of cardiovascular disease among working people and to study their impact on health behaviors. Material and methods: Surveys were carried out in May 2008 in the Voivodeship Industrial Medicine Centre in Lublin among 150 working persons aged 22-62. The survey employed the Framingham type A questionnaire, which estimates the escalation of 2 traits characteristic for type A personality - hurry and competitiveness, and the Health Behavior Inventory (IZZ) according to Juczyński, which evaluates health behavior in 4 categories, i.e. proper nutrition habits, preventive behavior, health practices and positive mental attitude. Results: The research suggests that the surveyed persons demonstrated intensified traits typical of type A personality, the most frequent being hurry (0.062). The statistical analysis allows one to establish that age groups 31-40 and 41-50 display stronger intensification of type A personality compared to other age groups (p=0.04; p=0.009). The global result of health behavior for the surveyed population amounted to 78.31, which is interpreted as an average result. Health behavior is 30% explained by the following variables: general life orientation, assessment of nutrition habits, sex, and intensification of type A characteristics. Conclusions: The group of working persons participating in the survey was characterised by the intensification of type A personality traits, dependent on age and education level. The male sex and the level of competitiveness traits, characteristic for type A personality pattern, influence the level of health behavior. Copyright © 2011 Cornetis.},

abstract={The theory of trade-off between starvation and predation risks predicts a decrease in body mass in order to improve flight performance when facing high predation risk. To date, this trade-off has mainly been validated in passerines, birds that store limited body reserves for short-term use. In the largest avian species in which the trade-off has been investigated (the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos), the slope of the relationship between mass and flight performance was steeper in proportion to lean body mass than in passerines. In order to verify whether the same case can be applied to other birds with large body reserves, we analyzed the response to this trade-off in two other duck species, the common teal (Anas crecca) and the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Predation risk was simulated by disturbing birds. Ducks within disturbed groups were compared to non-disturbed control birds. In disturbed groups, both species showed a much greater decrease in food intake and body mass during the period of simulated high risk than those observed in the control group. This loss of body mass allows reaching a more favourable wing loading and increases power for flight, hence enhancing flight performances and reducing predation risk. Moreover, body mass loss and power margin gain in both species were higher than in passerines, as observed in mallards. Our results suggest that the starvation-predation risk trade-off is one of the major life history traits underlying body mass adjustments, and these findings can be generalized to all birds facing predation. Additionally, the response magnitude seems to be influenced by the strategy of body reserve management. © 2011 Zimmer et al.},

abstract={Seabirds integrate information about oceanic ecosystems across time and space, and are considered sensitive indicators of marine conditions. To assess whether hypothesized long-term foodweb changes such as forage fish declines may be reflected in a consumer's life history traits over time, I used meta-regression to evaluate multi-decadal changes in aspects of egg production in the glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens), a common coastal bird. Study data were derived from literature searches of published papers and unpublished historical accounts, museum egg collections, and modern field studies, with inclusion criteria based on data quality and geographic area of the original study. Combined historical and modern data showed that gull egg size declined at an average of 0.04 cc y -1 from 1902 (108 y), equivalent to a decline of 5% of mean egg volume, while clutch size decreased over 48 y from a mean of 2.82 eggs per clutch in 1962 to 2.25 in 2009. There was a negative relationship between lay date and mean clutch size in a given year, with smaller clutches occurring in years where egg laying commenced later. Lay date itself advanced over time, with commencement of laying presently (2008-2010) 7 d later than in previous studies (1959-1986). This study demonstrates that glaucous-winged gull investment in egg production has declined significantly over the past ~50-100 y, with such changes potentially contributing to recent population declines. Though gulls are generalist feeders that should readily be able to buffer themselves against food web changes, they are likely nutritionally constrained during the early breeding period, when egg production requirements are ideally met by consumption of high-quality prey such as forage fish. This study's results suggest a possible decline in the availability of such prey, and the incremental long-term impoverishment of a coastal marine ecosystem bordering one of North America's rapidly growing urban areas. © 2011 Louise K.

abstract={Nocturnal carnivores are widely believed to have played an important role in human evolution, driving the need for night-time shelter, the control of fire and our innate fear of darkness. However, no empirical data are available on the effects of darkness on the risks of predation in humans. We performed an extensive analysis of predatory behavior across the lunar cycle on the largest dataset of lion attacks ever assembled and found that African lions are as sensitive to moonlight when hunting humans as when hunting herbivores and that lions are most dangerous to humans when the moon is faint or below the horizon. At night, people are most active between dusk and 10:00 pm, thus most lion attacks occur in the first weeks following the full moon (when the moon rises at least an hour after sunset). Consequently, the full moon is a reliable indicator of impending danger, perhaps helping to explain why the full moon has been the subject of so many myths and misconceptions. © 2011 Packer et al.},

abstract={In the laboratory, food restriction has been shown to induce neuroadaptations in brain reward circuitry which are likely to be among those that facilitate survival during periods of food scarcity in the wild. However, the upregulation of mechanisms that promote foraging and reward-related learning may pose a hazard when food restriction is self-imposed in an ecology of abundant appetitive rewards. For example, episodes of loss of control during weight-loss dieting, use of drugs with addictive potential as diet aids, and alternating fasting with alcohol consumption in order to avoid weight gain, may induce synaptic plasticity that increases the risk of enduring maladaptive reward-directed behavior. In the present mini-review, representative basic research findings are outlined which indicate that food restriction alters the function of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons, potentiates cellular and behavioral responses to D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptor stimulation, and increases stimulus-induced synaptic insertion of AMPA receptors in nucleus accumbens. Possible mechanistic underpinnings of increased drug reward magnitude, drug-seeking, and binge intake of sucrose in food-restricted animal subjects are discussed and possible implications for human weight-loss dieting are considered. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={People who were small at birth and had poor infant growth have an increased risk of adult cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes, particularly if their restricted early growth was followed by increased childhood weight gain. These relations extend across the normal range of birth size in a graded manner, so reduced size is not a prerequisite. In addition, larger birth size is associated with risks of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The associations appear to reflect developmental plastic responses made by the fetus and infant based on cues about the environment, influenced by maternal characteristics including diet, body composition, stress, and exercise levels. These responses involve epigenetic processes that modify the offspring's phenotype. Vulnerability to ill health results if the environment in infancy, childhood, and later life is mismatched to the phenotype induced in development, informed by the developmental cues. This mismatch may arise through unbalanced diet or body composition of the mother or a change in lifestyle factors between generations. These insights offer new possibilities for the early diagnosis and prevention of chronic disease. Copyright © 2011 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={The obesity epidemic is a major health concern. More than two thirds of Americans and more than one third of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle are contributing factors of overweight and obesity. Increasing physical activity in overweight and obese individuals can potentially improve health status and lower the risk of major health problems. Based on the theoretical frameworks of behavioral change models, health information technologies, and pervasive interactive technologies, a conceptual model has been developed. The proposed model is an intervention method combining a behavior change model and a personalized Health IT system using an interactive accelerometer-based pervasive technology component, to increase physical activity potentially in an overweight and obese population. The accelerometer automatically synchronizes with the personal health record database over wireless networks; the decision engine utilizes the theory of planned behavior model to form a feedback; and; proper interactive feedback is provided directly to the users in the personal health record interface. A prototype was developed based on the conceptual model. The prototype measures and stores the number of steps, type of steps and caloric consumption on a daily basis with an interval of 20 minutes by an advanced accelerometer that can simply be attached to any footwear. The accelerometer synchronizes automatically the stored data with a central database as soon as the participant enters a designated wireless area. Virtual characters that are embedded inside a personal health record system convey the feedback to the users. The feedback is generated based on the theory of planned behavior decision model utilizing the stored daily physical activity data. The interface prompts knowledge-based information, presents self-monitoring trend lines, and shows virtual character changes over time such as becoming obese, to reflect the tailored feedback message. In addition, the interface is integrated in a popular social-networking website where users can review other virtual characters and generate peer pressure. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of implementing a behavioral change intervention using pervasive health information technology among overweight and obese population. This research explains the development of the conceptual model, integration of wireless physical activity self-monitoring devices into personal health records, and the application of rich interactive media to convey messages to the users. The final prototype will be presented and preliminary findings will be discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), such as bisphenol A (BPA), may cause adverse health effects in wildlife and humans, but controversy remains as to what traits are most sensitive to EDCs and might serve as barometers of exposure. Expression of sexually selected traits that have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual choice of mating partner are more dependent on developmental and physical condition of an animal than naturally selected traits and thus might be particularly vulnerable to disruption by developmental exposure to EDCs. We have used the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a model to test this hypothesis. Adult male-male competition for mates in this species is supported by enhanced spatial navigational and exploratory abilities, which enable males to search for prospective, widely dispersed females. Male deer mice exposed to BPA or ethinyl estradiol (EE) through maternal diet showed no changes in external phenotype, sensory development, or adult circulating concentrations of testosterone and corticosterone, but spatial learning abilities and exploratory behaviors were severely compromised compared with control males. Because these traits are not sexually selected in females, BPA exposure predictably had no effect, although EE-exposed females demonstrated enhanced spatial navigational abilities. Both BPA-exposed and control females preferred control males to BPA-exposed males. Our demonstration that developmental exposure to BPA compromises cognitive abilities and behaviors essential for males to reproduce successfully has broad implications for other species, including our own. Thus, sexually selected traits might provide useful biomarkers to assess risk of environmental contamination in animal and human populations.},

abstract={It has been suggested that access to high caloric food attenuates stress response. The present paper investigates whether access to commercial chow enriched with glucose and fat, here referred to as comfort food alters behavioral, metabolic, and hormonal parameters of rats submitted to three daily sessions of foot-shock stress. Food intake, anxiety-like behaviors, and serum levels of insulin, leptin, corticosterone, glucose and triglycerides were determined. The rats submitted to stress decreased the intake of commercial chow, but kept unaltered the intake of comfort food. During the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, stressed rats increased the number of head dipping, entries into the open arms, as well as the time spent there, and decreased the number of stretched-attend posture and risk assessment. These effects of stress were independent of the type of food consumed. Non-stressed rats ingesting comfort food decreased risk assessment as well. Stress and comfort food increased time spent in the center of the open field and delayed the first crossing to a new quadrant. Stress increased the plasma level of glucose and insulin, and reduced triglycerides, although consumption of comfort food increases glucose, triglyceride and leptin levels; no effect on leptin level was associated to stress. The stress induced increase in serum corticosterone was attenuated when rats had access to comfort food. It was concluded that foot-shock stress has an anorexigenic effect that is independent of leptin and prevented upon access to comfort food. Foot-shock stress also has an anxiolytic effect that is potentiated by the ingestion of comfort food and that is evidenced by both EPM and open field tests. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective To assess convergent validity, factorial validity, test-retest reliability and internal consistency of a diet quality food behaviour checklist (FBC) for low-literate, low-income Spanish speakers.Design Participants (n 90) completed three dietary recalls, the Spanish-language version of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and the Spanish-language FBC. Factor structure was examined using principal component analysis. Spearman correlation coefficients between FBC item responses and nutrient intakes from 24 h recalls were used to estimate convergent validity. Correlation coefficients were also calculated between FBC item responses at two time points in another group of participants (n 71) to examine test-retest reliability. Cronbach's α coefficient was determined for items within each sub-scale.Setting Non-profit community agencies serving low-income clients, migrant farm worker camps and low-income housing sites in four California counties.Subjects Spanish-speaking women (n 161) who met income eligibility for the SNAP-Ed (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education).Results Factor analysis resulted in six sub-scales. Responses to nineteen food behaviour items were significantly correlated with hypothesized 24 h recall data (with a maximum correlation of 0·44 for drinking milk and calcium) or the USDA HFSSM (0·42 with the food security item). Coefficients for test-retest reliability ranged from 0·35 to 0·79. Cronbach's α ranged from 0·49 for the diet quality sub-scale to 0·80 for the fruit and vegetable sub-scale.Conclusions The twenty-two-item FBC and instruction guide will be used to evaluate USDA community nutrition education interventions with low-literate Spanish speakers.

abstract={The visual orienting behaviour towards prey in the free-moving mantis was investigated with a high-speed camera. The orienting behaviour consisted of head, prothorax, and abdomen rotations. Coordinated movements of these body parts in the horizontal plane were analysed frame-by-frame. Rotations of these body parts were initiated with no or slight (≤40. ms) differences in timing. The initiation timing of prothorax-abdomen rotation was affected by its initial angle before the onset of orienting. There were positive correlations in amplitude among head-prothorax, prothorax-abdomen, and abdomen rotations. The ratio of these rotations to total gaze rotation was affected by the initial prothorax-abdomen angle before the onset of orienting. Our data suggest that coordinated movements of the head, prothorax, and abdomen during orienting are ballistic events and are pre-determined according to visual and proprioceptive information before the onset of orienting. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are beneficial in reducing symptoms of depression. However, there is limited evidence regarding the influence of dietary n-3 PUFA intake on mood in adolescents drawn from population studies. Objective: In the present investigation, we examined the relationship between dietary n-3 PUFA intake on depression symptomatology in a large prospective pregnancy cohort followed for 17 years. Methods: Adolescents enrolled in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study completed a Food Frequency Questionnaire to assess dietary fatty acid intake, as well as other dietary factors at age 14 and a fasting blood sample was taken. Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory for Youth (BDI-Y) at age 14 (N = 1,407) and at age 17 (N = 995). Results: An inverse relationship was observed between intake of both saturated fat and of n-3 PUFA at age 14 and BDI-Y scores at both 14 and 17 years of age. However, after adjusting for energy (kJ) intake and other lifestyle confounders, the relationships were no longer significant. Conclusions: Associations previously reported between n3 PUFA and depressive symptoms may be due to collinearity with other dietary and lifestyle factors. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Foraging herbivores must deal with plant characteristics that inhibit feeding and they must avoid being eaten. Principally, toxins limit food intake, while predation risk alters how long animals are prepared to harvest resources. Each of these factors strongly affects how herbivores use food patches, and both constraints can pose immediate proximate costs and long-term consequences to fitness. Using a generalist mammalian herbivore, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), our aim was to quantitatively compare the influence of plant toxin and predation risk on foraging decisions. We performed a titration experiment by offering animals a choice between non-toxic food at a risky patch paired with food with one of five toxin concentrations at a safe patch. This allowed us to identify the tipping point, where the cost of toxin in the safe food patch was equivalent to the perceived predation risk in the alternative patch. At low toxin concentration, animals ate more from the safe than the risky patch. As toxin concentration increased at the safe patch, intake shifted until animals ate mainly from the risky patch. This shift was associated with behavioural changes: animals spent more time and fed longer at the risky patch, while vigilance increased at both risky and safe patches. Our results demonstrate that the variation in toxin concentration, which occurs intraspecifically among plants, can critically influence the relative cost of predation risk on foraging. We show that herbivores quantify, compare and balance these two different but proximate costs, altering their foraging patterns in the process. This has potential ecological and evolutionary implications for the production of plant defence compounds in relation to spatial variation in predation risk to herbivores. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Purpose of Review: Proinflammatory adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) contribute to obesity-associated disease morbidity. We will provide an update of the current state of knowledge regarding the phenotypic and functional diversity of ATMs in lean and obese mice and humans. Recent Findings: The phenotypic diversity of ATMs is now known to include more than two types requiring an expansion of the simple concept of an M2 to M1 shift with obesity. Potential functions for ATMs now include the regulation of fibrosis and response to acute lipolysis in states of caloric restriction. Novel pathways that can potentiate ATM action have been identified, which include inflammasome activation and the response to lipodystrophic adipose tissue. Studies provide a new appreciation for the ability of ATMs to respond dynamically to the adipose tissue microenvironment. Summary: ATMs play a key role in shaping the inflammatory milieu within adipose tissue, and it is now apparent that ATM heterogeneity is acutely shaped by the adipose tissue environment. To account for the new findings, we propose a new nomenclature for ATM subtypes that takes into account their diversity. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Seed selection, removal and subsequent management by granivorous animals is thought to be a complex interaction of factors including qualities of the seeds themselves (e.g., seed size, nutritional quality) and features of the local habitat (e.g. perceived predator risk). At the same time, differential seed selection and dispersal is thought to have profound effects on seed fate and potentially vegetation dynamics. In a feeding arena, we tested whether rodent species, seed species, and indirect and direct predation cues influence seed selection and handling behaviors (e.g., scatter hoarding versus larder hoarding) of two heteromyid rodents, Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) and the Great Basin pocket mouse (Perognathus parvus). The indirect cue was shrub cover, a feature of the environment. Direct cues, presented individually, were (1) control, (2) coyote (Canis latrans) vocalization, (3) coyote scent, (4) red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scent, or (5) short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) vocalization. We offered seeds of three sizes: two native grasses, Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) and bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), and the non-native cereal rye (Secale cereale), each in separate trays. Kangaroo rats preferentially harvested Indian ricegrass while pocket mice predominately harvested Indian ricegrass and cereal rye. Pocket mice were more likely to scatter hoard preferred seeds, whereas kangaroo rats mostly consumed and/or larder hoarded preferred seeds. No predator cue significantly affected seed preferences. However, both species altered seed handling behavior in response to direct predation cues by leaving more seeds available in the seed pool, though they responded to different predator cues. If these results translate to natural dynamics on the landscape, the two rodents are expected to have different impacts on seed survival and plant recruitment via their different seed selection and seed handling behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract={Evidence of altered antioxidant systems and signs of elevated oxidative stress are reported in peripheral tissue and brain of schizophrenic patients, including low levels of glutathione (GSH), a major thiol antioxidant and redox buffer. Functional and genetic data indicate that an impaired regulation of GSH synthesis is a vulnerability factor for the disease. Impaired GSH synthesis from a genetic origin combined with environmental risk factors generating oxidative stress (e.g., malnutrition, exposure to toxins, maternal infection and diabetes, obstetrical complications, and psychological stress) could lead to redox dysregulation. This could subsequently perturb normal brain development and maturation with delayed functional consequences emerging in early adulthood. Depending on the nature and the time of occurrence of the environmental insults, the structural and functional delayed consequences could vary, giving rise to various endophenotypes. The use of animal models of GSH deficit represents a valuable approach to investigate how interactions between genetic and environmental factors lead to the emergence of pathologies found in the disease. Moreover, these models of GSH can be useful to investigate links between schizophrenia and comorbid somatic disorders, as dysregulation of the GSH system and elevated oxidative stress are also found in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. This chapter reviews pharmacological and genetic rodent models of GSH synthesis dysregulation used to address some of the aforementioned issues. Up to date, these models revealed that GSH deficits lead to morphological, physiological, and behavioral alterations that are quite analogous to pathologies observed in patients. This includes hypofunction of NMDA receptors, alteration of dopamine neurotransmission, anomalies in parvalbumin- immunoreactive fast-spiking interneurons, and reduced myelination. In addition, a GSH deficit affects the brain in a region-specific manner, the anterior cingulate cortex and the ventral hippocampus being the most vulnerable regions investigated. Interestingly, a GSH deficit during a limited period of postnatal development is sufficient to have long-lasting consequences on the integrity of PV-IR interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex and impairs cognitive functions in adulthood. Finally, these animal models of GSH deficit display behavioral impairments that could be related to schizophrenia. Altogether, current data strongly support a contributing role of a redox dysregulation on the development of pathologies associated with the illness and demonstrate the usefulness of these models to better understand the biological mechanisms leading to schizophrenia. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Hatcheries often produce bold fish that are maladapted to survive in the wild, as absence of predators and selection for fast growth tend to favour risk-taking behaviors. Not surprisingly, losses of hatchery fish through predation can be high immediately after release and this may account for the failure of many ex-situ fish conservation programmes. For supportive-breeding to be useful, it is essential that released fish are able to display natural behaviors. We compared the performance of juvenile Atlantic salmon reared in environmentally-enriched tanks receiving natural prey and subjected to simulated predator attacks with fish reared under standard hatchery conditions while keeping densities constant. No differences were detected between controls and environmentally enriched fish in survival, final size or nutritional status. Yet, changes in rearing conditions had rapid and marked effects on risk-taking behavior. Environmentally enriched fish were 2.1 times less willing, and took significantly longer to leave shelter, than controls within two weeks of enrichment. Thus our study indicates that it is possible through environmental enrichment to modify at least one component of fishes' behavior known to have clear adaptive implications, i.e. the propensity of hatchery-reared fish to take excessive risks. Ex-situ conservation could therefore benefit from rearing fish in naturalized, structurally complex environments with natural prey to promote the development of more natural behaviors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Until recently, obesity was considered the product of interactions between genotype and lifestyle. However, recent work suggests that the genetic heritability of adiposity has been over-estimated, whilst epidemiological studies show that although many genes are associated with nutritional status, the effect of each is very small. A polygenic basis of obesity risk may arise through bet-hedging of numerous traits to accommodate diverse unpredictable environments, rather than through systematic local adaptation. Such 'fragmentation' of the genetic component of metabolism across multiple alleles may be a necessary pre-requisite for complementary enhancement of phenotypic plasticity. The inter-generational component of obesity refers to phenotypic effects transmitted across generations, arising from exposure to maternal, familial and environmental niches during development. Inter-generational transfers of somatic capital (height, lean mass) may respond to ecological conditions through a slow-response damping system, through the influence of maternal phenotype on offspring growth and body composition. The primary traits subject to inter-generational effects may be physique and life history strategy, with adiposity both aiding and responding as a flexible risk management strategy. The biological processes that underpin the offspring's developmental plasticity appear sensitive to the obesogenic niche. Through this sensitivity, diverse environmental factors can induce excess weight gain from childhood onwards. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={There is now evidence that developmental influences have lifelong effects on cardiovascular and metabolic function and that elements of the heritable or familial component of susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCD) can be transmitted across generations by non-genomic means. In animals the developmental environment induces altered phenotypes through genetic, physiological (especially endocrine) and epigenetic mechanisms. The latter include DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histones and non-coding RNAs. Such 'tuning' of phenotype has potential adaptive value and may confer Darwinian fitness advantage because it either adjusts the phenotype to current circumstances and/or attempts to match an individual's responses to the environment predicted to be experienced later. When the phenotype is mismatched to the later environment, e.g. from inaccurate nutritional cues from the mother or placenta before birth, or from rapid environmental change through improved socio-economic conditions, risk of NCD increases. Such mechanisms are also thought to play roles in ageing and early onset of puberty, reinforcing a life-course perspective on such adaptive responses, especially the detrimental later effects of trade-offs. Epigenetic changes induced during development are highly gene-specific and function at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides in both gene promoter and intergenic regions. Evidence is accruing that endocrine or nutritional interventions during early postnatal life can reverse epigenetic and phenotypic changes induced, for example, by unbalanced maternal diet during pregnancy. Elucidation of epigenetic processes may permit perinatal identification of individuals most at risk of later NCD and enable early intervention strategies to reduce such risk. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Food neophobia has been studied extensively in children, but its causal origins and relationship to eating behavior in adults are not well understood. We studied genetic and environmental effects on variation in food neophobia, measured using the Food Neophobia Scale, and explored associations between food neophobia and personality, pleasantness and use frequency of food groups, and body mass index in young adult twins (N = 1175, aged 20-25 years, 54.7% women). In women, additive genetic effects (heritability) accounted for 61% of variation in food neophobia, whereas in men, shared environmental effects explained 45% of the variation. Food neophobia negatively correlated with the personality trait Openness, corrected for the structural overlap (r = -0.23), and in women, these two traits had a genetic correlation (r g = -0.39). In addition, food neophobia negatively correlated with pleasantness and use frequency of fruits and vegetables and of fish and with mean pleasantness of foods. Once evolutionarily important, food neophobia should at present be considered in nutrition counseling as a possible barrier to a balanced diet. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Despite ongoing projects involving the breeding and release of equids into semi-wild and wild environments, insufficient information is available in the literature that describes strategies used by equids to adapt and survive in a novel environment. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of nave, feral Equus caballus (horse) mares to cope in a novel feral horse environment and investigate possible reasons why some may not survive this challenge. Four mares taken from a semi-arid desert environment remained in good health but significantly changed their movement behaviour pattern when surrounded by prime grazing habitat in a mesic temperate grassland. Three of the four mares captured from the prime grazing habitat and released in the semi-arid desert habitat died, apparently due to stress and/or starvation, within 8 weeks of release. The fourth mare survived 4 months but lost considerable weight. The group of mares relocated to the semi-arid desert environment had difficulty adapting to relocation and did not take up the movement behaviour strategy of local horses, which required long distance treks from a central water hole to distant feeding areas at least 15km away. The movement behaviour, range use and health consequences of relocating equids may be of interest to wildlife ecologists, animal behaviourists and horse welfare groups. The observations may be used to guide those intending on relocating managed domestic and native horses to novel habitats. © 2011 Australian Rangeland Society.},

abstract={The social insects live in extraordinarily complex and cohesive societies, where many individuals sacrifice their personal reproduction to become helpers in the colony. Identifying adaptive molecular changes involved in eusocial evolution in insects is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying transitions from solitary to social living, as well as the maintenance and elaboration of social life. Here, we review recent advances made in this area of research in several insect groups: the ants, bees, wasps, and termites. Drawing from whole-genome comparisons, candidate gene approaches, and a genome-scale comparative analysis of protein-coding sequence, we highlight novel insights gained for five major biological processes: chemical signaling, brain development and function, immunity, reproduction, and metabolism and nutrition. Lastly, we make comparisons across these diverse approaches and social insect lineages and discuss potential common themes of eusocial evolution, as well as challenges and prospects for future research in the field.},

abstract={Deforestation is rapidly transforming primary forests across the tropics into human-dominated landscapes. Consequently, conservationists need to understand how different taxa respond and adapt to these changes in order to develop appropriate management strategies. Our two year study seeks to determine how wild Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) adapt to living in an isolated agroforest landscape by investigating the sex of crop-raiders related to population demographics, and their temporal variations in feeding behaviour and dietary composition. From focal animal sampling we found that nine identified females raided cultivated fruits more than the four males. Seasonal adaptations were shown through orangutan feeding habits that shifted from being predominantly fruit-based (56% of the total feeding time, then 22% on bark) to the fallback food of bark (44%, then 35% on fruits), when key cultivated resources such as jackfruit (Artocarpus integer), were unavailable. Cultivated fruits were mostly consumed in the afternoon and evening, when farmers had returned home. The finding that females take greater crop-raiding risks than males differs from previous human-primate conflict studies, probably because of the low risks associated (as farmers rarely retaliated) and low intraspecific competition between males. Thus, the behavioral ecology of orangutans living in this human-dominated landscape differs markedly from that in primary forest, where orangutans have a strictly wild food diet, even where primary rainforests directly borders farmland. The importance of wild food availability was clearly illustrated in this study with 21% of the total orangutan feeding time being allocated to feeding on cultivated fruits. As forests are increasingly converted to cultivation, humans and orangutans are predicted to come into conflict more frequently. This study reveals orangutan adaptations for coexisting with humans, e.g. changes in temporal foraging patterns, which should be used for guiding the development of specific human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies to lessen future crop-raiding and conflicts. © 2011 Campbell-Smith et al.},

abstract={Whether animals experience human-like emotions is controversial and of immense societal concern [1-3]. Because animals cannot provide subjective reports of how they feel, emotional state can only be inferred using physiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures [4-8]. In humans, negative feelings are reliably correlated with pessimistic cognitive biases, defined as the increased expectation of bad outcomes [9-11]. Recently, mammals [12-16] and birds [17-20] with poor welfare have also been found to display pessimistic-like decision making, but cognitive biases have not thus far been explored in invertebrates. Here, we ask whether honeybees display a pessimistic cognitive bias when they are subjected to an anxiety-like state induced by vigorous shaking designed to simulate a predatory attack. We show for the first time that agitated bees are more likely to classify ambiguous stimuli as predicting punishment. Shaken bees also have lower levels of hemolymph dopamine, octopamine, and serotonin. In demonstrating state-dependent modulation of categorization in bees, and thereby a cognitive component of emotion, we show that the bees' response to a negatively valenced event has more in common with that of vertebrates than previously thought. This finding reinforces the use of cognitive bias as a measure of negative emotional states across species and suggests that honeybees could be regarded as exhibiting emotions.

abstract={Probability discounting is used to study risky decision-making in humans and rodents. In these paradigms, the subject chooses between a small reward that is always delivered and a large reward that is delivered with varying probabilities. Risk-taking is defined as a preference for the large, uncertain reward. The aversive consequence associated with this task involves choosing the large reward and not obtaining it. To study this form of impulsivity in rodents, food reinforcement is commonly used. Using this reinforcer, and the need to food-deprive rodents to enhance task performance, may be problematic in rodent models that exhibit eating disorders, in pharmacological assessments that alter feeding, and for assessments of the neurocircuitry that is engaged by both feeding and risk-taking. We reveal here that electrical intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) can be used as the positive reinforcer in risk assessments (i.e., probability discounting). ICSS was selected as it is rapidly acquired, the operant procedures are retained for months, and no tolerance or satiety develops to the reinforcer; thus, ICSS can be used in multiple test sessions in a repeated measures design. We developed an efficient, standardized, six phase ICSS-mediated protocol that allowed for the assessments of risk-taking in a probability discounting task. We demonstrated that the discounting behavior remained stable for several weeks. The value of this protocol is discussed in terms of practical as well as theoretical advantages of using ICSS-mediated reinforcement. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Supplemental feeding had no effect on home-range size, and exclusivity was not influenced by either treatment.

abstract={The potentially confounded effects of factors affecting breeding dispersal have rarely been simultaneously examined. The consequences of breeding dispersal are even less studied, presenting a paradox: breeding dispersal seldom seems to improve breeding success, despite its presumed adaptiveness. We studied the causes and consequences of breeding dispersal in female-philopatric eiders (Somateria mollissima) in relation to the spatiotemporal predictability of nest success. Previous nest fate, breeding experience, and breeding density simultaneously affected breeding dispersal. Dispersal distances were longer among inexperienced breeders and after failed breeding. Individual dispersal distances decreased with increasing nest-site-specific breeding density, whereas island-specific nesting success peaked at intermediate densities. The fate of neighbouring nests ('public information') did not influence dispersal. Breeding dispersal was unrelated to subsequent hatching success, controlling for individual quality (body condition, breeding experience, previous nest fate), while it delayed hatch date, which is likely to impair reproductive success. This delay may result from the loss of acquired information of local breeding conditions, prolonging nest prospecting and establishment, also helping explain why breeding dispersal did not increase at high breeding densities, despite a potential reduction in nesting success. In long-lived species, however, dispersal-induced reductions in reproductive output in one season could be offset by improved parental survival prospects. Careful nest prospecting may be profitable, because overall nest success had a strong island-specific component but showed weak temporal variation, and successive individual nest fates were predictable between years. Once a safe nest site is found, females may breed at the same place successfully for many years. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Rationale Early-onset drug taking is associated with increased likelihood of addiction, but it is unclear whether early onset is causal in development of addiction. Many other factors are associated with increased risk of addiction and also promote early intake. Here, a rodent model is used to explore the causality of early onset in development of self-administration and addiction-like behavior and to examine factors that promote self-administration. Methods We used cocaine self-administration to examine drug taking and addiction-like behavior in adolescent and adult rats a priori characterized for their locomotor responses to novelty and cocaine and behavior in the light-dark task. Results Adolescent animals initially sought more cocaine than adults. However, as the adolescents matured, their intake fell and they did not differ from adults in terms of unreinforced lever-pressing, extinction or reinstatement behavior. For both age groups, self-administration was positively correlated with the locomotor response to novelty, the locomotor response to cocaine, and with time in light in the light-dark task. The rats that were insensitive to cocaine's locomotor effects and that spent the least time in light in the light-dark task sought the least cocaine, appearing to be "protected" from the reinforcing effects of cocaine. There was no difference between the two age groups in appearance of this "protected" phenotype. Conclusions These results suggest that early onset of drug taking may promote increased use, but does not promote progression to addiction-like behavior. Furthermore, protective factors, such as innate anxiety and insensitivity to cocaine's pharmacological effects, function across developmental stages. © Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract={Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a method for increasing both the length and quality of life for over 500 years. Experimental work confirming the success of this approach in animals has accumulated over the last 100 years. Lifelong caloric restriction (CR) may extend life by up to 50% in rodents, with progressively less impact the later in life it is started. This effect is matched by profound impacts on age related diseases including reduced risk of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus. The disposable soma theory of ageing suggests that CR evolved as a somatic protection response to enable animals to survive periods of food shortage. The shutdown of reproductive function during CR is consistent with this suggestion, but other features of the phenomenon are less consistent with this theory, and some have suggested that in rodents it may be mostly an artifact of domestication. CR induces profound effects on animals at all levels from the transcriptome to whole animal physiology and behavior. Animals under CR lose weight which is disproportionately contributed to by white adipose tissue. Generally animals on CR change their activity patterns so that they are more active prior to food delivery each day but total activity may be unchanged or reduced. Considerable debate has occurred over the effects of CR on resting metabolic rate (RMR). Total RMR declines, but as body mass and body composition also change it is unclear whether metabolism at the tissue level also declines, is unchanged or even increases. Body temperature universally decreases. Hunger is increased and does not seem to abate even with very long term restriction. Circulating adipokines are reduced reflecting the reduction in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass under restriction and there is a large reduction in circulating insulin and glucose levels. There are profound tissue level changes in metabolism with a generalized shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Four pathways have been implicated in mediating the CR effect. These are the insulin like growth factor (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin pathway, the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. These different pathways may interact and may all play important roles mediating different aspects of the response. Exactly how they generate the health benefits remains open for debate, however CR results in reduced oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy, both of which could be essential components of the beneficial effects. Most data about the effects of CR in mammals comes from work on rodents. There is limited work on non-human primates that shows promising effects and one randomized controlled trial in humans where physiological markers of the CR response are consistent with the responses in mice and rats. There are also populations of humans voluntarily restricting themselves. Humans on long term restriction report similar negative side effects to those observed in animals - perpetual hunger, reduced body temperature leading to a feeling of being cold, and diminished libido. Considerable effort has been directed in recent years to find drugs that mimic the CR response. Promising candidates are those that intersect with the critical signaling pathways identified above and include biguanides such as metformin that target the insulin signaling pathway, stilbenes (e.g. resveratrol) that affect sirtuin activity and drugs such as rapamycin that interact with mTOR signaling. Whether it will ever be possible to find drugs that capture the health benefits of CR without the negative side-effects remains unclear. Moreover, even if such drugs are developed how the current licensing system for drug use in western societies would cope with them may be a further obstacle to their use. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with 3 presentations of hock lesions (hair loss, ulceration, and swelling) in freestall-housed lactating cattle. By independent identification and scoring of, and analysis of the factors associated with, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, the aim was to identify whether risk factors were common to all 3, or differed among the presentations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 76 herds in the UK during the winter housing period of 2007 to 2008, with a total of 3,691 cows examined for hock lesions. A randomly selected sample of approximately 50 cows in each herd were scored for body condition, lameness, cleanliness, rising behavior, and lesions at the hocks. For all cows, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling were scored separately on 4-point scales, with both left and right hocks scored. Based on a review of the literature, potential risk factors were identified and measured, collected from milk-recording data, or obtained through interviews with the farmers. Risk factors associated with hocks lesions in cattle were examined using data from the 2,982 cows housed in the 63 freestall-housed herds visited. Risk factors for each of the 3 lesion presentations were considered separately in multilevel logistic regression models, with moderate or severe hair loss, any degree of ulceration, and moderate or severe swelling as the outcome variables. Thirty risk factors were identified, none of which were common to all 3 lesion presentations. Five risk factors (locomotion score, number of days of winter housing, mean milk yield, freestall base material, and herd size) were common to both hair loss and ulceration. The stall bedding material was a common risk factor for both hair loss and swelling. A further 8, 5, and 11 risk factors were unique to hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The existence of several differential risk factors between the 2 lesion presentations suggests that ulceration may not always be a direct extension of hair loss, as has been implied in previous scoring systems. Of the 12 risk factors associated with swelling, only 1 was common to another lesion presentation, which suggests that swelling may have a different etiology than hair loss and ulceration. The variables associated with the lesions indicate the importance of factors that affect the lying and rising behavior of the animal, including freestall structure and design, and the lying surface. © 2011 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={In view of its fundamental and pervasive influences and impacts on organism physiology and ecology, body size is recognized as a key component of evolutionary fitness and serves as the cornerstone of a seminal contribution in freshwater zooplankton ecology-the Size Efficiency Hypothesis (SEH) of Brooks & Dodson (Science 150:28-35, 1965). While the roles and implications of body size in predation and competition-central tenets of the SEH-have been widely considered and reviewed, no broader integrated synthesis exists of the collective array of body size determinants and their implications in the ecology in crustacean zooplankton-a numerically and functionally dominant group of aquatic organisms. Focusing on planktonic Cladocera and Copepoda in inland waters, in particular, we provide a wide-ranging overview of the direct and/or indirect effects of environmental conditions, consumable resources and biotic interactions that independently and/or collectively influence the phenotypic expression of body size (particularly as length), both within and between species. Some indirect ultimate evolutionary consequences of body size are considered, and we identify some controversies and unresolved issues related to this biologically crucial trait. While by no means exhaustive, our overview reveals a complex nexus of extrinsic proximate abiotic and biotic factors and interactions that influence body size, the phenotypic expression of which in natural systems commonly reflects contrasting outcomes related to conflicting direct and/or indirect selective pressures. In general, however, body size (both inter- and intra specifically) declines with rising temperature and increases with rising food supply (depending on its quality), although both temperature and food supply exert contrary influences on particular taxa (or life history stages) under certain environmental circumstances. Predation undoubtedly has an overriding influence on body size selection. Depending on its mechanistic basis (visual, tactile or both in tandem), it selectively favours either small or large body size, both within (adults vs. juveniles) and between prey species, which are accordingly often 'size-trapped' between contrasting selective pressures, with consequent indirect effects. The bioenergetics of fundamental physiological processes undoubtedly set constraints on body size and serve as the primary determinant. However, within such constraints, the phenotypic expression of body size reflects its adaptive modification in response to the prevailing abiotic and biotic environment. As such, body size represents an emergent ecological property, reflecting the outcome of specific circumstances and conditions, which vary both temporally within and spatially between different ecosystems, and are accordingly context dependent. Nevertheless, underlying physiological advantages of larger size (within and between species) among crustacean zooplankters-lower mass-specific metabolic rates (although recently challenged), higher individual feeding rates (at least among cladocerans), potentially wider food size-ranges, better starvation tolerances, higher potential fecundity, etc.-collectively favour the selection of increased body size, as predicted by the SEH. Although competitive superiority of large size (measured in terms of minimal food requirements) has been confirmed experimentally, this cannot be generalized to natural conditions, where conflicting and temporally variable pressures apply, and contribute to generally mixed, and temporally variable body size compositions. Complex underlying ecological interactions and influences ultimately determine the phenotypic expression of body size in directions consistent with fitness optimization under prevailing circumstances. Certain specific and general deficiencies in information are identified. In particular, the overwhelming emphasis on daphniid cladocerans as model study taxa in freshwater ecosystems has marginalized the acquisition of a comparably broad and penetrating understanding of specific features both of non-daphniid cladoceran and copepod life histories and body size selection. Among daphniid cladocerans, contemporary definitive understanding devolves largely from reductionist laboratory approaches. Holistic re-integration of these mechanistic findings into natural system circumstances presents a difficult challenge that is attracting increasingly attention. With regard to copepods, synthetic integration of the expansive marine knowledge base appears crucial to inform and direct future investigations on freshwater taxa. The question of intrinsic body size regulation in copepods and cladocerans, especially in regard to final phenotypic plasticity in body size expression, awaits resolution. Overall, body size remains a multi-facetted and complex topic, offering promising challenges for further investigation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a behavioral ecologist's view on adaptive responses to early stress. I first summarize two approaches to this topic drawn from other papers in this Special Issue: the 'inoculation model' and the 'adaptive calibration model'. I then describe three relevant modeling approaches from behavioral and evolutionary ecology: models of adaptive plasticity, models of adaptive prey behavior under uncertainty about risk, and models of state-dependent adaptive behavioral syndromes. These models generate some novel predictions on factors that explain variation in how organisms might respond adaptively to early stress. In particular, the state-dependent models of adaptive behavioral syndromes emphasize the importance of feedback loops between behavior and state variables in explaining the long-term persistence of effects of early experiences. State variables can include aspects of physiology, morphology or life history, differences among individuals in information state or skill, or even in social state (e.g., social rank). The feedbacks between behavior and individual state suggest a framework for an integrative approach to understanding responses to stress. The behavioral syndrome approach also emphasizes the importance of understanding stress carryovers - e.g., situations where effects of one kind of stressor (e.g., early social stress) carry over to influence other stress responses (e.g., response to danger) later in life. Finally, I discuss how responses to early stress might relate to variation in the ability of animals to cope well with novel conditions associated with human-induced rapid environmental change, a ubiquitous problem that animals face in the modern world. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Individual variation in the way animals cope with stressors has been documented in a number of animal groups. In general, two distinct sets of behavioural and physiological responses to stress have been described: the proactive and the reactive coping styles. Some characteristics of stress coping style seem to be coupled to the time to emerge of fry from spawning redds in natural populations of salmonid fishes. In the present study, behavioural and physiological traits of stress coping styles were compared two and five months after emergence in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), using individuals with an early or late time to emerge. Initially, compared to late emerging individuals, early emerging individuals showed a shorter time to resume feeding after transfer to rearing in isolation. Resumption of feeding after isolation was suggested to be related to boldness behaviour, rather than hunger, in the present study. This observation was repeated five months after emergence, demonstrating behavioural consistency over time in this trait. However, in other traits of proactive and reactive stress coping styles, such as social status, resting metabolism or post stress cortisol concentrations, early and late emerging individuals did not differ. Therefore, this study demonstrates that boldness in a novel environment is uncoupled from other traits of the proactive and reactive stress coping styles in farmed salmonids. It is possible that this decoupling is caused by the low competitive environment in which fish were reared. In natural populations of salmonids, however, the higher selection pressure at emergence could select for early emerging individuals with a proactive coping style. © 2011.},

abstract={Great apes sometimes feed on items of low nutritional value with bioactive secondary compounds. These molecules may be toxic and neophobia is presumed to be an essential factor in avoiding the ingestion of noxious items. The aim of this study is to investigate, in captive orangutans, individual and social learning involved in the discovery and ingestion of new items. We presented novel aromatic plants - 11 fresh plants and 4 infused plants - to 4 captive weaned Bornean orangutans, both under isolated and group conditions, and recorded their behaviour and interactions between group members. All animals tasted by nibbling or ingested most of the plants presented. Regardless of the experimental condition, individual responses did not vary visibly across the sessions, despite numerous close observations, and food transfers between individuals were observed. Our results suggest that a low level of neophobia and a strong propensity to look to conspecifics for information allow Bornean orangutans to expand their diet after weaning. Our results also provide some evidence that olfaction is a key sense in determining food edibility based on previous experience. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Sick animals may change their feeding behaviour to compensate for infections. However, there is little information regarding whether infection affects (1) feeding behaviour of predators, (2) feeding behaviour using an experimental approach in the wild, (3) other costly behaviours and/or (4) physiological components of condition. We experimentally infected males of the predatory damselfly Hetaerina americana in a field experiment. We hypothesized that infection would reduce feeding behaviour. We further predicted a reduction in territorial activity, an increase in immune response (measured by the activity of phenoloxidase, PO) and a reduction of fat reserves and flight-associated muscle mass (two traits usually traded off with immune ability and territorial behaviour). We also infected males in a laboratory experiment that controlled for food supply and territorial activity, and measured the same physiological characters. Immune challenges in the field experiment unexpectedly increased feeding rate but did not change territorial activities. Muscle mass was reduced in the field but not in the laboratory, probably because of differences in the presence of energetically expensive territorial activities. In the laboratory, starvation and infection reduced PO activity and fat stores but did not affect muscle mass. Thus, our field and laboratory results support the idea that increased feeding compensates for infections in predators. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet, compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2 consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with potential fitness consequences, depending on payoffs of explorative strategies in different environmental conditions. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Major depressive disorder (MDD) and diabetes mellitus type II (T2DM) are two of the major health challenges of our time. It has been shown that MDD and T2DM are highly co-morbid, and recent work has proposed a bi-directional connection between the diseases.The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on behavior and metabolism in a genetic rat model of depression, the Flinders Sensitive and Resistant Line (FSL/FRL) rats. Age and weight matched rats were fed a HFD or control diet for 10 weeks and subjected to behavioral testing and metabolic assessment.We found that HFD exacerbated the depressive-like behavior of the FSL rat in the Forced Swim Test (FST), a depression screening tool, although it did not affect the non-depressed FRL rat despite a higher caloric intake. Moreover, the depressive-like phenotype was associated with reduced anxiety and impairment in novel object recognition memory, while HFD consumption led to diminished object recognition memory as well. In both strains HFD increased insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test, although fasting blood glucose levels were only significantly increased by HFD in the FSL rat, suggesting a greater metabolic susceptibility in this rat strain.We conclude that compared with the FRL rat, the FSL rat is more susceptible to developing aberrant behaviors related to depression following metabolic stress induced by HFD. Further studies with a mechanistic focus could potentially lead to a better understanding of a possible pathophysiological link between T2DM and MDD. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study reveals that both cyanobacterial toxicity and turbidity have the potential to reduce the growth and energy storage of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch and thereby influence survival rates. During the 1990's a reduction in recruitment of YOY perch (Perca fluviatilis) occurred along the Swedish East coast. Concurrently, large blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria have increased in the Baltic Proper and in coastal waters. This study examined whether extended exposure to toxic and non-toxic filamentous cyanobacterium Nodularia affect YOY perch growth and feeding behavior under simulated bloom conditions (30 days at 50 μg Chl a L-1). Specific growth rate (SGR), the somatic condition index (SCI) and the lipid content of YOY perch (10-12 weeks old) were significantly lower in perch exposed to Nodularia compared to fed controls (no Nodularia). YOY perch exposed to non-toxic Nodularia displayed a higher attack rate than perch living in Nodularia free controls in 2 out of 3 trials. Reductions in growth and energy storage, mediated by cyanobacteria, increase the risk of starvation and predation and could locally influence recruitment of YOY perch. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The composition and nutritional value of meat and milk derived from cloned animals and their progeny has not been demonstrated to be different from normal animals, but possible food consumption risks that might arise from unidentified hazards remain. In this study, we investigated the effects of somatic cell nuclear transfer cloned-cattle meat diet on the behavioral and reproductive characteristics of F1 rats derived from dams that were also fed on cloned-cattle meat. Methods and results: F1 rats were divided into five diet groups with their dams: commercial pellets (control), pellets containing 5% (N-5) and 10% (N-10) of normal-cattle meat, and diets containing 5% (C-5) and 10% (C-10) of cloned-cattle meat. In most cases, the cloned-cattle meat diet did not affect body weight and food consumption in both male and female F1 rats during 11 weeks, except for significantly higher body weight in both N-5 and N-10 (3-5 weeks, p<0.05 or p<0.01) and significantly higher food consumption in the both normal- and cloned-cattle meat groups (7-9 weeks, p<0.05 or p<0.01), as compared with the controls, respectively. We detected no signs of test substance-related toxicities on organ weights and behavioral characteristics (sensory reflex, motor function, and spatial learning and memory tests). Reproductive functions did not significantly differ among all examined rats (mating, fertility, and implantation). Conclusions: These behavioral and reproductive toxicity results suggest that there are no obvious food safety concerns related to cloned-cattle meat in these parameters. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Previous studies have shown that dysfunctions in the serotonin system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) are associated strongly with suicidal behavior and suicide, especially among individuals with major depressive disorder. Suicidal behavior has been explained using both the stress-diathesis model and the state-trait interaction model. Specifically, diatheses, or trait-dependent risk factors, are associated with dysfunctions in the serotonin system; however, stress responses, or state-dependent factors, are associated with HPA hyperactivity. Decreases in cholesterol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels have been associated with impaired brain plasticity among individuals with suicidal behavior. Decreased serotonin functioning has been measured using cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 5-HIAA, fenfluramine challenge studies, and platelet 5-HT2A receptors. HPA axis dysfunction has been evaluated with the dexamethasone suppression test. Cholesterol and BDNF levels have been measured in blood serum or plasma. Nevertheless, challenges to finding promising and accessible neurobiological predictors of suicide and suicidal behavior remain. As suicide behavior is a complex phenomenon, a combined or multidimensional approach, including each of the aforementioned methods, may be required to predict suicide risk among individuals with major depressive disorder. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The importance of developmental factors in influencing the risk of later-life disease has a strong evidence base derived from multiple epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies in animals and humans. During early life, an organism is able to adjust its phenotypic development in response to environmental cues. Such developmentally plastic responses evolved as a fitness-maximizing strategy to cope with variable environments. There are now increasing data that these responses are, at least partially, underpinned by epigenetic mechanisms. A mismatch between the early and later-life environments may lead to inappropriate early life-course epigenomic changes that manifest in later life as increased vulnerability to disease. There is also growing evidence for the transgenerational transmission of epigenetic marks. This article reviews the evidence that susceptibility to metabolic and cardiovascular disease in humans is linked to changes in epigenetic marks induced by early-life environmental cues, and discusses the clinical, public health and therapeutic implications that arise. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract={Objective. This study investigated whether infants' temperament at 18 months is associated with the feeding of foods and drinks that may increase the risk for later obesity. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of mothers and infants (N = 40 266) participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Data were collected by questionnaire. Predictor variables were: infants' temperament at 18 months (internalizing, externalizing, and surgency/extraversion), and mothers' negative affectivity. Outcome variables were feeding of sweet foods, sweet drinks, and night-time caloric drinks at 18 months (all dichotomized). Confounders were child's gender, weight-for-height at 1 year, breastfeeding, and mother's level of education. Results. After controlling for confounders, infant temperament dimensions at 18 months were significantly associated with mothers' feeding of potentially obesogenic foods and drinks independent of mothers' negative affectivity. Infants who were more internalizing were more likely to be given sweet foods (OR 1.47, CI 1.32-1.65), sweet drinks (OR 1.76, CI 1.56-1.98), and drinks at night (OR 2.91, CI 2.54-3.33); infants who were more externalizing were more likely to be given sweet food (OR 1.53, CI 1.40-1.67) and sweet drinks (OR 1.22, CI 1.11-1.34); and infants who were more surgent were more likely to be given drinks at night (OR 1.66, CI 1.42-1.92).

abstract={Bariatric surgery has complemented the medical care of patients with obesity at Hospital Na Homolce since 2004. Multidisciplinary cooperation becomes essential. The bariatric team consists not only of a surgeon, a nurse and an anaesthetist, but also an internist, a nutritionist, a psychologist, and possibly a psychiatrist. Our article brings contributions of the psychologist in the bariatric team, and describes the possibilities and importance of his psychological intervention and treatment, both preoperatively and postoperatively. The article offers a review of the methods used in the psychodiagnostic examination prior to surgery, and also mentions the risk factors, such as in cases of deeper pathology in eating behaviour, a personality disorder, low probability of the patient's postoperative compliance and so on, which can decrease the effectiveness of bariatric treatment. In cases where there is psychological contraindication for surgery, the psychologist should offer suitable psychotherapeutic or psychiatric alternative treatment.},

abstract={Behaviors in insects are partly highly efficient Bayesian processes that fulfill exploratory tasks ending with the colonization of new ecological niches. The foraging (for) gene in Drosophila encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). It has been extensively described as a frequency-dependent gene and its transcripts are differentially expressed between individuals, reflecting the population density context. Some for transcripts, when expressed in a population at high density for many generations, concomitantly trigger strong dispersive behavior associated with foraging activity. Moreover, genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) analysis has highlighted a dormant role of for in energetic metabolism in a food deprivation context. In our current report, we show that alleles of for encoding different cGMP-dependent kinase isoforms influence the oxidation of aldehyde groups of aromatic molecules emitted by plants via Aldh-III and a phosphorylatable adaptor. The enhanced efficiency of oxidation of aldehyde odorants into carboxyl groups by the action of for lessens their action and toxicity, which should facilitate exploration and guidance in a complex odor environment. Our present data provide evidence that optimal foraging performance requires the fast metabolism of volatile compounds emitted by plants to avoid neurosensory saturation and that the frequency-dependent genes that trigger dispersion influence these processes. © 2011 Arthaud et al.},

abstract={Background: Accurate estimates of movement behavior and distances travelled by animals are difficult to obtain, especially for small-bodied insects where transmitter weights have prevented the use of radio-tracking. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e.g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites. © 2011 Hagen et al.},

abstract={Background: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive neuronal inclusions represents a novel entity (FTLD-TDP) that may be associated with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND); involvement of extrapyramidal and other systems has also been reported.Case presentation: We present three cases with similar clinical symptoms, including Parkinsonism, supranuclear gaze palsy, visuospatial impairment and a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, associated with either clinically possible or definite MND. Neuropathological examination revealed hallmarks of FTLD-TDP with major involvement of subcortical and, in particular, mesencephalic structures. These cases differed in onset and progression of clinical manifestations as well as distribution of histopathological changes in the brain and spinal cord. Two cases were sporadic, whereas the third case had a pathological variation in the progranulin gene 102 delC.Conclusions: Association of a "progressive supranuclear palsy-like" syndrome with marked visuospatial impairment, motor neuron disease and early behavioral disturbances may represent a clinically distinct phenotype of FTLD-TDP. Our observations further support the concept that TDP-43 proteinopathies represent a spectrum of disorders, where preferential localization of pathogenetic inclusions and neuronal cell loss defines clinical phenotypes ranging from frontotemporal dementia with or without motor neuron disease, to corticobasal syndrome and to a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome. © 2011 Rusina et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Predation directly triggers behavioural decisions designed to increase immediate survival. However, these behavioural modifications can have long term costs. There is therefore a trade-off between antipredator behaviours and other activities. This trade-off is generally considered between vigilance and only one other behaviour, thus neglecting potential compensations. In this study, we considered the effect of an increase in predation risk on the diurnal time-budget of three captive duck species during the wintering period. We artificially increased predation risk by disturbing two groups of 14 mallard and teals at different frequencies, and one group of 14 tufted ducks with a radio-controlled stressor. We recorded foraging, vigilance, preening and sleeping durations the week before, during and after disturbance sessions. Disturbed groups were compared to an undisturbed control group. We showed that in all three species, the increase in predation risk resulted in a decrease in foraging and preening and led to an increase in sleeping. It is worth noting that contrary to common observations, vigilance did not increase. However, ducks are known to be vigilant while sleeping. This complex behavioural adjustment therefore seems to be optimal as it may allow ducks to reduce their predation risk. Our results highlight the fact that it is necessary to encompass the whole individual time-budget when studying behavioural modifications under predation risk. Finally, we propose that studies of behavioural time-budget changes under predation risk should be included in the more general framework of the starvation-predation risk trade-off. © 2011 Zimmer et al.},

abstract={Contemporary trends in obesity mean that research into whether unbalanced diets could impact on behavioural traits became increasingly important. The timing of exposure to obesity is particularly important, as sensitive periods during development have been identified where dietary extremes play a critical role in determining adult risk of physiological dysfunction. To this end, female Wistar rats were fed on chow or cafeteria diet (CD) for 8. weeks from weaning until mating. Half of the mated animals within each group were crossed-over to the alternative diet. This generated four treatment groups, differing in their pre-gestational and gestational diets. After birth, offspring of dams from each of the 4 pregnancy groups were further divided into groups, either being fed chow or CD throughout lactation. Anxiety-related behaviour and exploration in the offspring were tested in the Elevated Plus Maze (EMP) and the Open Field (OF) at 10. weeks of age. Maternal obesity significantly reduced the EPM locomotor activity in male and female offspring and grooming in males. Lactational CD had an anxiolytic effect in male offspring as shown in the EPM (increased entries into and more time on open arms) and the OF (shorter latency to enter the centre). In both sexes, lactational CD reduced grooming upon exposure to the EPM and the OF. Post mortem analysis revealed a stimulant effect of lactational CD on adipose tissue growth. The present study demonstrates that pre-gestational, gestational and lactational maternal CD programme behaviour in the offspring with lactational CD reducing anxiety in the male offspring. © 2011.},

abstract={Environmental conditions experienced early in life have been shown to significantly affect growth trajectories at later stages in many vertebrate species. Amphibians typically have a biphasic life history, with an aquatic larval phase during early development and a subsequent terrestrial adult phase after completed metamorphosis. Thus, the early conditions have an especially strong impact on the future survival and fitness of amphibians. We studied whether early nutritional conditions affect the behavioural reaction of fire salamander larvae (Salamandra salamandra) before completion of metamorphosis. Fire salamander larvae reared under rich nutritional conditions were heavier and larger, displayed better body condition overall throughout the first three month of life and metamorphosed earlier compared with larvae raised under poor nutritional conditions. Specifically, we tested whether larvae reared under these different conditions differed with respect to their risk-taking behaviour and activity. We found no differences in the activity of larvae with respect to their experienced early food conditions. However, larvae reared under poor nutritional conditions hid significantly more often in a risk-taking test than larvae reared under rich food conditions. This increase in shelter-seeking behaviour might be an adaptation to reduce the risk of larval drift or an adaptation to compensate for physiological deficits in part by appropriate behavioural reactions. Our results indicate that environmental conditions, such as food availability, may lead to different behavioural strategies. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Nutrient balancing is well known in herbivores and omnivores, but has only recently been demonstrated in predators. To test how a predator might regulate nutrients when the prey varies in nutrient composition, we restricted juvenile Pardosa prativaga wolf spiders to diets of one of six fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, prey types varying in lipid:protein composition during their second instar. We collected all fly remnants to estimate food and nutrient intake over each meal. The spiders adjusted their capture rate and nutrient extraction in response to prey mass and nutrient composition irrespective of energy intake. Intake was initially regulated to a constant lipid plus protein mass, but later spiders fed on prey with high proportions of protein increased consumption relative to spiders fed on other prey types. This pattern indicates that the spiders were prepared to overconsume vast amounts of protein to gain more lipids and energy. The spiders also regulated protein after ingestion, and ingested protein was incorporated less efficiently into body tissue when the prey was protein rich. Despite both pre- and postingestive nutrient regulation, the body lipid:protein compositions of the spiders were highly affected by the nutrient compositions of their prey, and growth in carapace length and lean body mass increased with increasing prey protein:lipid ratio. Our results demonstrate that prey nutrient composition affects these predators, but also that the spiders possess behavioural and physiological adaptations that lead to partial compensation for these effects. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This study tested a multi-dimensional model that consisted of factors across three domains (personal, medical, and lifestyle factors) to understand determinants of QoL in adults with type 2 diabetes. A total of 1,147 adults with type 2 diabetes completed a self-report survey which assessed demographic factors, personality (activity sub-trait), medical factors (diabetes duration, insulin use, number of comorbidities, and Body Mass Index), lifestyle behaviors (smoking, physical activity, and diet), and two indicators of QoL [i.e., health-related quality of life (HRQL) and life satisfaction (LS)]. The model explained 27.1 and 18.2% of the variance for HRQL and LS, respectively. Age was positively related to HRQL (β = 0.14, P < 0.01). Personality (sub-activity trait) was the strongest, independent variable in both HRQL (β = 0.25, P < 0.01) and LS (β = 0.25, P < 0.01) after controlling for demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. Physical activity was positively associated (β = 0.14, P < 0.01) with HRQL but not with LS. Personality may be a useful screening tool to distinguish adults with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for poor QoL.},

abstract={Changes in dietary preferences in animal species play a pivotal role in niche specialization. Here, we investigate how divergence of foraging behaviour affects the trophic position of animals and thereby their role for ecosystem processes. As a model, we used two closely related bat species, Myotis myotis and M. blythii oxygnathus, that are morphologically very similar and share the same roosts, but show clear behavioural divergence in habitat selection and foraging. Based on previous dietary studies on synanthropic populations in Central Europe, we hypothesised that M. myotis would mainly prey on predatory arthropods (i. e., secondary consumers) while M. blythii oxygnathus would eat herbivorous insects (i. e., primary consumers). We thus expected that the sibling bats would be at different trophic levels. We first conducted a validation experiment with captive bats in the laboratory and measured isotopic discrimination, i. e., the stepwise enrichment of heavy in relation to light isotopes between consumer and diet, in insectivorous bats for the first time. We then tested our trophic level hypothesis in the field at an ancient site of natural coexistence for the two species (Bulgaria, south-eastern Europe) using stable isotope analyses. As predicted, secondary consumer arthropods (carabid beetles; Coleoptera) were more enriched in 15N than primary consumer arthropods (tettigoniids; Orthoptera), and accordingly wing tissue of M. myotis was more enriched in 15N than tissue of M. blythii oxygnathus. According to a Bayesian mixing model, M. blythii oxygnathus indeed fed almost exclusively on primary consumers (98%), while M. myotis ate a mix of secondary (50%), but also, and to a considerable extent, primary consumers (50%). Our study highlights that morphologically almost identical, sympatric sibling species may forage at divergent trophic levels, and, thus may have different effects on ecosystem processes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Premature delivery is often complicated by neonatal growth restriction (GR) and neurodevelopmental impairment. Because global overnutrition increases the risk of adult metabolic syndrome, we sought a targeted intervention. Premature delivery and perinatal GR decrease circulating levels of the neurotrophic hormone leptin. We hypothesized that leptin supplementation would normalize the outcomes of mice with incipient neonatal GR. Pups were fostered into litters of 6 or 12 to elicit divergent growth patterns. Pups in each litter received injections of saline or leptin from d 4 to 14. At 4 mo, mice underwent tail cuff blood pressure measurement, behavioral testing, and MRI. Mice fostered in litters of 12 had decreased weanling weights and leptin levels. Neonatal leptin administration normalized plasma leptin levels without influencing neonatal growth. Leptin replacement also normalized the hypertension, stress-linked immobility, conditioned fear, and amygdala enlargement seen in neonatal growth restricted male mice. In control males, neonatal leptin administration led to hypothalamic enlargement, without overt neurocardiovascular alterations. Female mice were less susceptible to the effects of neonatal GR or leptin supplementation. In conclusion, the effects of neonatal leptin administration are modulated by concurrent growth and gender. In growth restricted male mice, physiologic leptin replacement improves adult neurocardiovascular outcomes. Copyright © 2011 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play an important role in excitatory neurotransmission and mediate synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory. NMDA receptors are composed of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits and the identity of the NR2 subunit confers unique electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties to the receptor. The precise role of NR2C-containing receptors in vivo is poorly understood. We have performed a battery of behavioral tests on NR2C knockout/. nβ-galactosidase knock-in mice and found no difference in spontaneous activity, basal anxiety, forced-swim immobility, novel object recognition, pain sensitivity and reference memory in comparison to wildtype counterparts. However, NR2C knockout mice were found to exhibit deficits in fear acquisition and working memory compared to wildtype mice.

abstract={There is increasing evidence that the early life environment, of which nutrition is a key component, acts through developmental adaptations to set the capacity of cardiovascular and metabolic pathways, and ultimately the limits to physiological challenges in later life. Suboptimal maternal nutrition and fetal growth result in reduced microvascular perfusion and functional dilator capacity, which are strongly associated with later development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. These conditions are also linked to microvascular rarefaction and remodeling that together limit capillary recruitment, reduce exchange capacity and increase diffusion distances of metabolic substrates, and increase local and overall peripheral resistance. Changes in small vessel structure and function may be seen very early, long before the onset of overt cardiovascular and metabolic disease, and may thus be a target for early therapeutic and lifestyle intervention strategies. This article explores how a disadvantageous microvascular phenotype may result from perinatal priming and how developmental plasticity may become an important and additional risk determinant in susceptibility to cardiometabolic disease in adult life. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Objective: Aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of paediatric headache and periodic syndromes in a school population and to evaluate the co-existence of environmental predisposing conditions. Design and methods: A 60-item questionnaire was completed by a school-based sample (n = 1536, ages 6-18 years). Diagnostic assessment of primary headache and periodic syndromes was established in first section; predisposing conditions in the second section; while the third section quantified the frequency of self medication and identified drugs most frequently used. Results: Headache was reported by 62.1% of subjects. Socioeconomic status, composition of family unit and nutrition habits in the first year of life did not appear significantly different in subjects with headache compared to healthy controls. A good sleep quality was found in 95.2% of healthy controls, in 89.4% of children with occasional headache. Recurrent abdominal pain, motor weakness and car sickness was significantly higher in primary headache group compared to occasional headache. Depressive/anxious traits were significantly higher in primary headache and occasional headache groups than in healthy controls. The frequency of aggressive traits was also higher in children with primary headache compared to occasional headache and healthy control subjects. 72.5% of subjects with primary headache and 58.4% of children with occasional headache assumed medicines to relieve pain. Paracetamol was the most frequently assumed drug. Conclusions: Our data show a more frequent occurrence of anxious/depressive profile in children suffering from primary headache. In agreement with literature data, this research points out that self-treatment is a relevant problem in paediatric headache. © 2010 European Paediatric Neurology Society.},

abstract={Phenological events of plants and animals are sensitive to climatic processes. Migration is a life-history event exhibited by most large herbivores living in seasonal environments, and is thought to occur in response to dynamics of forage and weather. Decisions regarding when to migrate, however, may be affected by differences in life-history characteristics of individuals. Long-term and intensive study of a population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, allowed us to document patterns of migration during 11 years that encompassed a wide array of environmental conditions. We used two new techniques to properly account for interval-censored data and disentangle effects of broad-scale climate, local weather patterns, and plant phenology on seasonal patterns of migration, while incorporating effects of individual life-history characteristics. Timing of autumn migration varied substantially among individual deer, but was associated with the severity of winter weather, and in particular, snow depth and cold temperatures. Migratory responses to winter weather, however, were affected by age, nutritional condition, and summer residency of individual females. Old females and those in good nutritional condition risked encountering severe weather by delaying autumn migration, and were thus risk-prone with respect to the potential loss of foraging opportunities in deep snow compared with young females and those in poor nutritional condition. Females that summered on the west side of the crest of the Sierra Nevada delayed autumn migration relative to east-side females, which supports the influence of the local environment on timing of migration. In contrast, timing of spring migration was unrelated to individual life-history characteristics, was nearly twice as synchronous as autumn migration, differed among years, was related to the southern oscillation index, and was influenced by absolute snow depth and advancing phenology of plants. Plasticity in timing of migration in response to climatic conditions and plant phenology may be an adaptive behavioral strategy, which should reduce the detrimental effects of trophic mismatches between resources and other life-history events of large herbivores. Failure to consider effects of nutrition and other life-history traits may cloud interpretation of phenological patterns of mammals and conceal relationships associated with climate change. © 2011 Monteith et al.},

abstract={Olfaction is an integral part of feeding providing predictive cues that anticipate ingestion. Although olfactory function is modulated by factors such as prolonged fasting, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently identified ghrelin receptors in olfactory circuits in the brain. We therefore investigated the role of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin in olfactory processing in rodents and humans, testing the hypothesis that ghrelin lowers olfactory detection thresholds and enhances exploratory sniffing, both being related to food seeking. In rats, intracerebroventricular ghrelin decreased odor detection thresholds and increased sniffing frequency. In humans, systemic ghrelin infusions significantly enhanced sniff magnitudes in response to both food and nonfood odorants and air in comparison to control saline infusions but did not affect the pleasantness ratings of odors. This is consistent with a specific effect on odor detection and not the hedonic value of odors. Collectively, our findings indicate that ghrelin stimulates exploratory sniffing and increases olfactory sensitivity, presumably enhancing the ability to locate, identify, and select foods. This novel role is consistent with ghrelin's overall function as a signal amplifier at the molecular interface between environmental and nutritional cues and neuro endocrine circuits controlling energy homeostasis. © 2011 the authors.},

abstract={In the present paper, we explore a novel preparation for the study of animal choice behaviour designed to capture some aspects of naturally occurring patch exploitation. Although one can cast the problem of patch exploitation as a binary choice, naturally occurring patch-leaving decisions are inevitably asymmetric. We asked whether captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, treat leaving and staying in the same way. To do this we factorially varied the delays associated with leaving and staying in a food patch. In addition, we manipulated our subject's level of motivation (e.g. hunger) using prefeeding treatments. We found that hungry subjects came closest to our prediction of treating leaving and staying in the same way, but that less motivated subjects showed a pronounced and surprising bias in favour of leaving. We discuss the implications of results for experimental and theoretical studies and choice behaviour. We suggest that students of choice behaviour need to understand the sources of such biases because naturally occurring choice situations are seldom perfectly symmetrical. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system, is well documented in humans and laboratory models and is known to increase infection risk, morbidity, and mortality among the old. Immunosenescence patterns have recently been unveiled in various free-living populations, but their consequences in the wild have not been explored. We investigated the consequences of immunosenescence in free-living Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor through a field experiment simulating a bacterial infection (challenge with lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in females of different ages during the nestling rearing period. We assessed behavioral and physiological responses of females, as well as growth and quality of their offspring, to determine the costs associated with the simulated infection. Results of the experiment differed between the two years of study. In the first year, old females challenged with LPS lost more body mass and reduced their nest visitation rates more, and their offspring tended to grow slower compared to similarly challenged younger females. In contrast, in the second year, old females did not appear to suffer larger costs than younger ones. Interestingly, immunosenescence was only detected during the first year of the study, suggesting that it is the dysregulated immune function characteristic of immunosenescent individuals rather than age per se that can lead to higher costs of immune defense in old individuals. These results provide the first evidence of costs of immunosenescence in free-living animals and support the hypothesis that old, immunosenescent individuals pay higher costs than younger ones when faced with a challenge to their immune system. Our results also suggest that these costs are mediated by an exaggerated sickness behavior, as seen in laboratory models, and can be modulated by ecological factors such as weather conditions and food availability. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={1. Pollutants as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are of worldwide concern, due to their detrimental effects on the physiology and behaviour of wildlife. One major source of EDCs is sewage treatment works which serve as foraging grounds for many bird species. However, the risks of consuming EDCs to wild birds at these sites have been largely overlooked. 2. We have previously quantified contamination levels of invertebrates from within filter beds of sewage treatment works and the intake rates of these invertebrates by wild European starlings feeding at these sites. Our work to date has shown that environmentally-relevant EDC exposure results in reduced immunocompetence, increased song behaviour and neural development in adult starlings. 3. In the present study, we hypothesized that nestling starlings exposed to similar EDC levels from contaminated prey, from parental feeding at sewage treatment works, would show altered growth and physiology. 4. Our findings show that EDC exposure results in reduced growth and immunocompetence in nestling birds. However, there was no effect on corticosterone or haematocrit levels. As growth rates and immunocompetence are likely to be related to survival rates, we suggest that these exposure levels are likely to adversely affect recruitment into the adult population. 5. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the potential transfer of EDCs between semi-aquatic or aquatic organisms and terrestrial organisms up the food chain at sites of sewage treatment works, broadening the scope of potential routes of exposure. Our findings suggest that birds foraging in these sites are at risk of physiological manipulation from EDCs and reduced body condition as a result. We advocate further work to evaluate the potential for EDCs from sewage treatment works to bioaccumulate and modulate the condition of wild organisms feeding on contaminated prey. Our results suggest that changes in management practices of sewage treatment works are required. We support measures to reduce EDC levels in sewage treatment works and that these sites should be designed to exclude or deter wildlife from foraging on contaminated prey. The management implications of such policy - oriented steps will ensure the health of wildlife foraging at sewage treatment works. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Anhedonia is a core symptom of depression that also characterizes substance abuse-related mood disorders, in particular those secondary to stimulant abuse. This study investigated the long-lasting condition of cocaine sensitization as an inducing condition for anhedonia in rats. Cortical-mesolimbic dopamine plays a central role in assessing the incentive value of a stimulus and an increased dopamine output in these areas after a novel palatable meal seems to correlate with the ability to acquire an instrumental behaviour aimed at earning it again. This dopaminergic response is associated with consistent modifications in the phosphorylation pattern of some cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates and it is mediated by dopamine D1 receptor stimulation. Thus, since behavioural cocaine sensitization is characterized by tonically increased levels of phospho-Thr75 DARPP-32 that is a potent PKA inhibitor, we hypothesized that cocaine-sensitized rats might reveal deficits in palatable food responding. Indeed, non-food-deprived cocaine-sensitized rats showed no interest in palatable food, no dopaminergic response after a palatable meal in terms of increased dopamine output and DARPP-32 phosphorylation changes, and no ability to acquire a palatable food-sustained instrumental behaviour. Repeated administration of an established antidepressant compound, imipramine, corrected these deficits and reinstated the dopaminergic response in the cortico-mesolimbic areas to control values. Thus, the behavioural modifications observed in cocaine-sensitized rats satisfy some requirements for an experimental model of anhedonia since they are induced by repeated cocaine administration (aetiological validity), they mimic an anhedonia-like symptom (construct validity), and are reversed by the administration of imipramine (predictive validity). © CINP 2010.},

abstract={Objective: Binge eating involves an abnormal motivation for highly palatable food in that these foods are repeatedly consumed despite their binge-triggering effects and life-affecting consequences associated with binge eating. We determined if rats identified as binge-eating prone (BEP) similarly display abnormal motivation for palatable food. Method: Food-sated BEP and binge-eating resistant (BER) rats were given voluntary access to palatable food paired with increasing intensity of footshock. Later, they were exposed to a period of cyclic caloric restriction-refeeding. Results: BEPs consumed significantly more and tolerated higher levels of footshock for palatable food than BERs. Cyclic restriction-refeeding increased BERs' tolerance of shock for palatable food. Discussion: Previously observed parallels of the rat BEP model to human binge eating can now be extended to include an abnormal motivation for palatable food. This model should prove useful in identifying specific genes that interact with the nutritional environment to mediate binge eating and may point to novel physiological targets to treat compulsive overeating. © 2010 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Mineral licks-also known as "salados," "saladeros," or "collpas"-are specific sites in tropical and temperate ecosystems where a large diversity of mammals and birds come regularly to feed on soil. Although the reasons for vertebrate geophagy are not completely understood, animals are argued to obtain a variety of nutritional and health benefits from the ingestion of soil at mineral licks. We studied the temporal patterns of mineral lick use by white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) and red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) in a lowland rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador. Using camera and video traps at four different mineral licks, combined with behavioral follows of one group of spider monkeys, we documented rates of mineral lick visitation by both primate species and the relative frequency and intensity of mineral lick use by spider monkeys. On the basis of 1,612 days and 888 nights of mineral lick monitoring, we found that A. belzebuth and A. seniculus both visit mineral licks frequently throughout the year (on average ~14% of days for both species), and mineral lick visitation was influenced by short-term environmental conditions (e.g. sunny and dry weather). For spider monkeys, the area surrounding the lick was also the most frequently and most intensively used region within the group's home range. The fact that spider monkeys spent long periods at the lick area before coming to the ground to obtain soil, and the fact that both species visited the lick preferentially during dry sunny conditions (when predator detectability is presumed to be relatively high) and visited simultaneously more often than expected by chance, together suggest that licks are indeed perceived as risky areas by these primates. We suggest that howler and spider monkeys employ behavioral strategies aimed at minimizing the probability of predation while visiting the forest floor at risky mineral lick sites. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Plasticity in developmental programming has evolved in order to provide the best chances of survival and reproductive success to the organism under changing environments. Environmental conditions that are experienced in early life can profoundly influence human biology and long-term health. Developmental origins of health and disease and life-history transitions are purported to use placental, nutritional, and endocrine cues for setting longterm biological, mental, and behavioral strategies in response to local ecological and/or social conditions. The window of developmental plasticity extends from preconception to early childhood and involves epigenetic responses to environmental changes, which exert their effects during life-history phase transitions. These epigenetic responses influence development, cell-and tissue-specific gene expression, and sexual dimorphism, and, in exceptional cases,could be transmitted transgenerationally. Translational epigenetic research in child healthis are iterative process that ranges from research in the basic sciences, preclinical research,and pediatric clinical research. Identifying the epigenetic consequences of fetal programming creates potential applications in clinical practice: the development of epigenetic biomarkers for early diagnosis of disease, the ability to identify susceptible individuals at risk for adult diseases, and the development of novel preventive and curative measures that are based on diet and/or novel epigenetic drugs. © 2011 by The Endocrine Society.},

abstract={Although there is great interest in identifying the neural correlates of cognitive processes that create risk for psychopathology, there is a paucity of research in young children. One event-related potential (ERP), the N2, is thought to index conflict monitoring and has been linked cognitive and affective risk factors for anxiety. Most of this research, however, has been conducted with adults, adolescents, and older children, but not with younger children. To address this gap, the current study examined 26 4-8-year-olds, who completed a cued flanker task while EEG was continuously recorded. We assessed whether the N2 was detectable in this group of young children and examined associations between the N2 and factors reflecting affective risk (e.g., reduced executive attention, temperamental effortful control, and temperamental surgency). We documented an N2 effect (greater N2 amplitude to incongruent versus congruent flankers), but only in children older than 6 years of age. Increases in the N2 effect were associated with less efficient executive attention and lower temperamental effortful control. We discuss the implications of these findings and consider how they may inform future studies on biomarkers for cognitive and affective risk factors for anxiety. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: It is no surprise that it has taken over four decades to confirm and extend the crucial role of dopamine and related genes and gene deficits in the etiology of risk for drug dependence. Hundreds of studies, enabled by neuroscience neuroimaging and genetic advances, have been reported. While dopamine theories have been reported, confirmed, replicated and replicated again, changes have been slow to move from the bench to the bedside. Unlike penicillin used to target certain infections, addiction requires the consent, motivation and enthusiastic participation of the patient. Clearly, current treatment has not caught up with advances in the science. In-patient and out-patient treatment still relies on detoxification, abstinence and 12 step programs. Addiction is a chronic and relapsing disease. Addiction treatment can be reported as cures at 3 or 6 weeks, only to be clearly failures at 1 or 5 years. The logical standard of care should focus on detoxifying, stabilizing and returning the patient to the pre-loss of control or pre-addiction neurochemical state. Method: Pre-clinical and clinical data on neurochemistry and neurogenetics of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) as it relates to both relapse and drug hunger has been reviewed. Results: We are proposing herein that efforts to physiologically integrate known neural mechanisms with other psychotherapeutic treatment options to combat relapse should be encouraged. It is well known that after prolonged abstinence, recovered addicts are particularly vulnerable to relapse. Individuals who use their drug of choice after abstinence experience a powerful euphoria that can quickly precipitate a full-blown relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum has remained elusive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed "supersensitivity" might be the result of pre-morbid or state genetic hypodopaminergic polymorphisms. Hypothesis: We are proposing that recent studies have indicated that genetic, personality and environmental factors are predictors of drug use in adolescents. Exploration of various treatment approaches for the most part reveal poor outcomes in terms of relapse prevention and continued drug hunger. The authors are proposing a new paradigm shift in residential, non-residential and aftercare involving the incorporation of genetic testing to identify risk alleles coupled with D2 receptor stimulation using neuroadatogen amino acid precursor enkephlinase - catecholamine-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition therapy. A natural but therapeutic nutraceutical formulation potentially induces DA release could cause the induction of D2-directed mRNA and proliferation of D2 receptors in the human. We further hypothesize that this proliferation of D2 receptors in turn will induce the attenuation of drug-like craving behavior. Finally, pharmacological therapies have had limited success because these powerful agents have focused on maintenance or interference with drug euphoria rather than correcting or compensating for pre-morbid dopamine system deficits These concepts await further confirmation via required neuro-imaging studies. © 2011.},

abstract={The basal ganglia (BG) appear to play a prominent role in associative learning, the process of pairing external stimuli with rewarding responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that the contributions of various BG components may be described within a reinforcement learning model, in which a broad repertoire of possible responses to environmental stimuli are evaluated before the most profitable one is chosen. The striatum receives diverse cortical inputs, providing a rich source of contextual information about environmental cues. It also receives projections from midbrain dopaminergic neurons, whose phasic activity reflects a reward prediction error signal. These coincident information streams are well suited for evaluating responses and biasing future actions toward the most profitable response. Still lacking in this model is a mechanistic description of how initial response variability is generated. To investigate this question, we recorded the activity of single neurons in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), the primary BG output nucleus, in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta) performing a motor associative learning task. A subset (29%) of GPi neurons showed learning-related effects, decreasing firing during the early stages of learning, then returning to higher baseline rates as associations were mastered. On a trial-by-trial basis, lower firing rates predicted exploratory behavior, whereas higher rates predicted an exploitive response. These results suggest that, during associative learning, BG output is initially permissive, allowing exploration of a variety of responses. Once a profitable response is identified, increased GPi activity suppresses alternative responses, sharpening the response profile and encouraging exploitation of the profitable learned behavior. © 2011 the authors.},

abstract={Food availability can affect larval survival directly through starvation and indirectly through the effects on larval growth rate, swimming performance and vulnerability to predators. In the present study we evaluate the effects of starvation on growth, nutritional condition and swimming behaviour of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) throughout ontogeny (8 to 14 days after hatching). Biochemical analysis (RNA/DNA ratios) and behavioural experiments (critical swimming speed, Ucrit) were conducted on larvae reared under 3 feeding treatments: fed ad libitum, deprived of food for 48 hours and deprived of food for 96 hours. Growth was significantly affected by feeding treatment, while only slight decreases in RNA/DNA ratio and swimming performance were registered. Late stage larvae of the three feeding treatments had slower critical speeds than the pre-flexion and flexion stages, which is probably related to the benthic lifestyle acquired by the species at the end of the larval period. These physiological and behavioural changes are in accordance with previous results, which show that flatfish larvae are more resistant to starvation than pelagic species and that they become less active later in development.},

abstract={Isoflavone-rich diets are associated with reduced menopausal symptoms and lowered risk of cancers of reproductive tissues. Isoflavones may mimic some effects of estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors, and/or altering steroid availability. Despite their potential health benefits, neither the effects, nor mechanisms, of isoflavones are well understood. We hypothesized that isoflavones would alter behavior and physiology of rats in sex and/or gonad-dependent manner. An isoflavone-based, commercially-available, dietary supplement was administered via subcutaneous implantation to female and male, intact and gonadectomized Long-Evans rats. Affective (elevated plus-maze), cognitive (water-maze), and reproductive (sexual) behavior was examined. Weights of reproductive structures were measured, as an index of trophic effects. Steroid levels in circulation and brain regions associated with behavioral measures were evaluated by radioimmunoassay. The supplement increased anti-anxiety behavior of intact, but not gonadectomized, rats. The supplement enhanced visual-spatial performance of all rats, but this effect was most evident among proestrous female rats, which had the poorest spatial performance. There were neither effects of the supplement on sexual behavior, mass of reproductive tissues, nor plasma steroid levels. The supplement increased levels of 5α-androstane, 17ß-diol-3α-diol (3α-diol) in the hippocampus (but not other brain regions) of gonadectomized females. Thus, the supplement altered anxiety and cognitive behavior and brain production of steroids; however, the anti-anxiety effects were limited to rats with an intact reproductive axis and effects on cognitive performance and neurosteriodogenesis were most evident among intact and gonadectomized, female rats respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The function of sleep in physiology, behaviour and cognition has become a primary focus of neuroscience. Its study inevitably includes experimental sleep deprivation designs. However, concerns exist regarding confounds like stress, increased locomotor activity levels, and decreased motivation to perform operant tasks induced by the methods employed. We here propose a novel procedure for sleep deprivation in rats and evaluate how it affects sleep, corticosterone concentration profiles, locomotor activity levels, and motivation to perform an operant task. Before, during and after 12. h of total sleep deprivation by means of gradually increasing the rotation variability and the speed of a novel automated, two-compartment sleep deprivation device, sleep-wake states were assessed by electroencephalography (n= 21), brain extracellular corticosterone concentrations using microdialysis (n= 11), locomotor activity by infrared measurements (n= 8), and operant performance using a fixed-interval-fixed-ratio task (n= 16). Sleep was effectively prevented during the procedure; rats on average slept less than 1% of the time (0.8 ± 0.2%, mean ± standard error). Brain corticosterone concentrations were mildly increased during the procedure, but did not exceed normal peak concentrations. Locomotor activity was not only increased during the procedure, but also did not exceed the peak levels found during undisturbed wakefulness. Food restriction to 12. g/rat/day prevented sleep deprivation from reducing the motivation to perform an operant task. This novel procedure can be applied to sleep deprive rats in a highly effective way, while keeping corticosterone and locomotor activity within the normal range. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study investigated physiological and behavioral functions of a novel gene identified from the termite Reticulitermes flavipes. The gene, named deviate, encodes an apparent ligand binding protein from the takeout-homologous family. Initial studies were conducted to investigate deviate mRNA expression among termite castes and body regions, and changes in response to light-dark conditions, starvation, temperature, and juvenile hormone (JH). Deviate has ubiquitous caste and tissue expression, including antennal expression. Consistent with characteristics of other takeout family members, deviate expression is responsive to photophase conditions (p< 0.1), and feeding, temperature, and JH (p< 0.05). Using RNA-interference (RNAi) techniques, short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to the deviate gene were synthesized and injected into worker termites, which were then subjected to bioassays designed to (1) induce caste differentiation or (2) measure various behavioral aspects of foraging and trail following. No impacts on JH-dependent caste differentiation were observable. However, trail following accuracy was significantly reduced in termites that received deviate siRNA injections, and this pattern generally mirrored deviate mRNA attenuation and recovery after RNAi. In a subsequent distance foraging bioassay, deviate-silenced termites exhibited equal feeding levels to controls, suggesting the deviate gene is not linked to general vigor or the ability/motivation of termites to move and forage. These findings are among the first linking the expression of a termite gene with eusocial behavior; they illustrate the connection between deviate expression and trailing behavior, which is a key evolutionary adaptation vital to subterranean social insects such as termites and ants. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction The increase of obesity in Mexico has been exponential; however referring to it is not easy because eight out of ten patients will abandon their diet treatment program before they reach their goal. This will contribute to maintain the risks of chronic degenerative diseases associated with obesity. Objectives Identifying the factors that cause the abandon of the diet program before they reach their goal in patients diag nosed with obesity. Method Quantitative study, non experimental- cross-sectio - nal, correlational. A total of 147 clinical files were analyzed and then causes of diet program abandon were determined. Results The maximum percentage advance at the moment of treatment abondonment was 58%. 87% of them abandoned the program in the first quarter of the same. Five main causes were found in the diet abandonment; being unreal expectations the highest of all. Vacation time shows a weaker correlation but, it was also a cause related to diet abandonment, being summer vacation time the period in which more patients quit. The lowest variable was the presence of lifestyles that are not compatible with the diet. On the other hand, the age group that showed the greater advance before quitting was the group between 40 and 49 years old. Stress as a cause of diet abandonment showed little relevance. The coefficient of determination for the sum of the variables is 0.76. Discussion Despite the other determined variables show some degree of the relation between the program abandonment, none shows on its own the decision to abandon the diet, however they explain the 76% of the abandonment, as a result we can consider abandoning the diet program a multifactor decision. Conclusion Based on the patients behavior, the characteristics of the service given in the office and the type of analyzed variables, the development of an integral solution is proposed, this will accompany the patients in the fulfillment of their goal in their diet program.},

abstract={Current work in behavioral ecology contrasts traditional hypotheses of context-specific adaptation with the suggestion that behaviors are often coupled such that animals exhibit context-general behavioral syndromes. Wasteful killing, the partial consumption and/or abandonment of prey, is a perplexing phenomenon because the costs of this behavior seem high (e.g. energetic loss, risk of injury). Wasteful killing may be the product of a context-specific, adaptive foraging strategy restricted spatially and/or temporally to conditions of prey abundance. Alternatively, wasteful killing may represent a context-general syndrome of high aggression that results in the capture of prey that are not consumed. We investigated the conditions in which a web-building spider the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) participates in wasteful killing. We employed a powerful repeated-measures design that reduces error variance by controlling for individual differences. Across the adult life cycle of female spiders collected from urban habitats throughout Phoenix, AZ, we repeatedly measured each spider's foraging voracity and wastefulness after varied periods of food restriction (2, 7, and 14d). While food restriction decreased body condition, condition alone was a poor predictor of voracity and wasteful killing. Our results indicate that previous food restriction i) shortens latency to attack, ii) heightens the number of prey killed per trial, and iii) reduces wastefulness. Latency to attack and wasteful killing were neither repeatable within individuals nor correlated with each other and therefore appear unlikely to be components of a behavioral syndrome. We discuss other possible benefits for wasteful killing in the contexts of predation risk and mate attraction. © 2011 Arizona St. University.},

abstract={An extensive literature has documented differences in the way individual animals cope with environmental challenges and stressors. Two broad patterns of individual variability in behavioural and physiological stress responses are described as the proactive and reactive stress coping styles. In addition to variability in the stress response, contrasting coping styles may encompass a general difference in behavioural flexibility as opposed to routine formation in response to more subtle environmental changes and non-threatening novelties. In the present study two different manipulations, relocating food from a previously learned location, and introducing a novel object yielded contrasting responses in rainbow trout selected for high (HR) and low (LR) post stress plasma cortisol levels. No difference was seen in the rate of learning the original food location; however, proactive LR fish were markedly slower than reactive HR fish in altering their food seeking behaviour in response to relocated food. In contrast, LR fish largely ignored a novel object which disrupted feeding in HR fish. Hence, it appears that the two lines appraise environmental cues differently. This observation suggests that differences in responsiveness to environmental change are an integral component of heritable stress coping styles, which in this particular case, had opposite effects on foraging efficiency in different situations. Context dependent fitness effects may thus explain the persistence of stable divergence of this evolutionary widespread trait complex. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Growth rate is an ecologically important trait, affecting the energy acquisition from, and provisioning to, the surrounding community. One of many costs suggested to counteract the evolution of increased intrinsic growth rate is an associated reduction in tolerance to conditions of nutrient stress. Here we test this concept with individuals possessing experimentally increased intrinsic growth rates (growth hormone transgenic coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch) relative to wild genotypes. Using a series of three experiments, survival and growth of both genotypes were assessed on a physiological and behavioral level while varying food abundance, social interactions, and predation risk. Only in complete absence of exogenous food in newly emerged fry did the high intrinsic growth rate appear costly with a shorter average survival time compared to wild-type (Exp. 1). In experiment 2, genotypes with elevated intrinsic growth showed equal or higher survival and growth than wild-type genotypes In a third experiment, adding very limited amounts of food and allowing for social interactions in a simulated natural environment benefited transgenic individuals relative to wild-types, but at similar magnitudes in both the absence and presence of predators. Populations with transgenic individuals present did not crash under these competitive conditions as previously reported when studied in simple environments where hiding and attack escape were not possible. Our data suggest that transgenic fish have a greater scope for growth under most conditions, but are not obligated to use this capability. Physiological (e.g. appetite and conversion efficiency) and behavioral traits (e.g. competitive ability and risk-taking) found previously to correlate positively with intrinsic growth rate in the transgenic strain likely aided in their survival and growth, even under food limited conditions. Hence, at least in coho salmon, intrinsic growth rate does not appear to strongly affect survival under nutrient stress. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The late preweanling rat has potential as a preclinical model for disorders initially manifested in early childhood that are characterized by dysfunctional interactions with specific stimuli (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism). No reports, however, of specific-stimulus exploration in the late preweanling rat are found in the literature. We examined the behavioral responses of normal late preweanling (PND 18-19) and adult rats when presented with exemplars of categorically-varied stimuli, including inanimate objects systematically varied in size and interactive properties, biological stimuli, and food. Preweanlings were faster to initiate specific stimulus exploration and were more interactive with most specific stimuli than adults; the magnitude of these preweanling-adult quantitative differences ranged from fairly small to very large depending upon the stimulus. In contrast, preweanlings were adult-like in their interaction with food and prey. Preweanling response to some stimuli, for example to live pups, was qualitatively different from that of adults; the preweanling behavioral repertoire was characterized by pup-seeking while the adult response was characterized by pup-avoidance. The specific stimulus interactions of preweanlings were less impacted than those of adults by the time of day of testing and placement of a stimulus in an anxiety-provoking location. The impact of novelty was stimulus dependent. The differences in interactions of preweanlings versus adults with specific stimuli suggests that CNS systems underlying these behavior patterns are at different stages of immaturity at PND 18 such that there may be an array of developmental trajectories for various categories of specific stimuli. These data provide a basis for the use of the preweanling as a preclinical model for understanding and medicating human disorders during development that are characterized by dysfunctional interactions with specific stimuli. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Communication is shaped and constrained by the signaling environment. In aquatic habitats, turbidity can reduce both the quantity and quality of ambient light and has been implicated in the breakdown of visual signaling. Here, we examined the relationship between turbidity (quantified with long-term data) and the expression of carotenoid-based nuptial coloration in the red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis), a small-bodied cyprinid. Males in more turbid habitats displayed redder fins, and an experimental manipulation of adult diet suggested that carotenoid intake alone did not explain among-population color differences. These results run counter to similar studies where signal expression decreased in turbid conditions, and may be explained by the non-territorial red shiner mating system, interactions between the mechanism of coloration and the signaling environment, or reduced cost of color expression in turbid habitats (e.g., reduced predation risk). Our results highlight how the behavioral and ecological contexts in which signals function can shape evolutionary responses to the environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={1. Cross-ecosystem movements of resources, including detritus, nutrients and living prey, can strongly influence food web dynamics in recipient habitats. Variation in resource inputs is thought to be driven by factors external to the recipient habitat (e.g. donor habitat productivity and boundary conditions). However, inputs of or by 'active' living resources may be strongly influenced by recipient habitat quality when organisms exhibit behavioural habitat selection when crossing ecosystem boundaries. 2. To examine whether behavioural responses to recipient habitat quality alter the relative inputs of 'active' living and 'passive' detrital resources to recipient food webs, we manipulated the presence of caged predatory fish and measured biomass, energy and organic content of inputs to outdoor experimental pools of adult aquatic insects, frog eggs, terrestrial plant matter and terrestrial arthropods. 3. Caged fish reduced the biomass, energy and organic matter donated to pools by tree frog eggs by ∼70%, but did not alter insect colonisation or passive allochthonous inputs of terrestrial arthropods and plant material. Terrestrial plant matter and adult aquatic insects provided the most energy and organic matter inputs to the pools (40-50%), while terrestrial arthropods provided the least (7%). Inputs of frog egg were relatively small but varied considerably among pools and over time (3%, range=0-20%). Absolute and proportional amounts varied by input type. 4. Aquatic predators can strongly affect the magnitude of active, but not passive, inputs and that the effect of recipient habitat quality on active inputs is variable. Furthermore, some active inputs (i.e. aquatic insect colonists) can provide similar amounts of energy and organic matter as passive inputs of terrestrial plant matter, which are well known to be important. Because inputs differ in quality and the trophic level they subsidise, proportional changes in input type could have strong effects on recipient food webs. 5. Cross-ecosystem resource inputs have previously been characterised as donor-controlled. However, control by the recipient food web could lead to greater feedback between resource flow and consumer dynamics than has been appreciated so far. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This article aims to provide a structured review of how to create settings and environments that prevent the development of childhood overweight and obesity. It also describes which institutions and levels are responsible for environmental (global) approaches in obesity prevention and which evidence exists in terms of process and outcomes of different preventive measures. Environmental approaches in disease prevention deal with social and technical-material conditions of daily living, as those conditions significantly influence health behavior. Strategies that focus on the obesogenic environment are considered increasingly important in the prevention of obesity in children and adolescents. They can be applied at different levels (e.g., schools, communities). These interventions should aim to improve the availability of healthy foods and physical activity facilities, e.g., by provision of healthy meals and foods in schools, restaurants, and stores and by price reductions of healthy foods. Physical activity can be supported by creating attractive green spaces and playgrounds in schools and cities, improving sidewalk networks and a supportive pedestrian environment, and implementing walk-to-school projects. On a national level, policies and legislation can support changes in the social and situational environments, e.g., relating to catering in schools or TV advertisement. The practice of environmental approaches is complex, because many stakeholders from different sectors have to be involved. This may account for the observation that environmental approaches are currently underrepresented in obesity prevention. © 2011 Springer Medizin Verlag.},

abstract={We studied developmental plasticity under food stress in three female-biased size dimorphic predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus californicus, and Amblyseius andersoni. All three species prey on two-spotted spider mites but differ in the degree of adaptation to this prey. Phytoseiulus persimilis is a specialized spider mite predator, N. californicus is a generalist with a preference for spider mites, and A. andersoni is a broad generalist. Immature predators were offered prey patches of varying density and their survival chances, dispersal tendencies, age and size at maturity measured. Amblyseius andersoni dispersed earlier from and had lower survival chances in low density prey patches than N. californicus and P. persimilis. Age at maturity was not affected by prey density in the generalist A. andersoni, whereas both the specialist P. persimilis and the generalist N. californicus accelerated development at low prey densities. Species-specific plasticity in age at maturity reflects opposite survival strategies when confronted with limited prey: to prematurely leave and search for other food (A. andersoni) or to stay and accelerate development (P. persimilis, N. californicus). In all species, size at maturity was more plastic in females than males, indicating that males incur higher fitness costs from deviations from optimal body size. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have amassed showing that the risk of developing disease in later life is dependent on early life conditions, mainly operating within the normative range of developmental exposures. This relationship reflects plastic responses made by the developing organism as an evolved strategy to cope with immediate or predicted circumstances, to maximize fitness in the context of the range of environments potentially faced. There is now increasing evidence, both in animals and humans, that such developmental plasticity is mediated in part by epigenetic mechanisms. However, recognition of the importance of developmental plasticity as an important factor in influencing later life health-particularly within the medical and public health communities-is low, and we argue that this indifference cannot be sustained in light of the growing understanding of developmental processes and the rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disease globally. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Adaptations that minimize the effects of stress are important components of avian development and have a role in structuring the relationship between development and fitness. I examined the effect of experimental manipulations of developmental stress during the nestling and fledgling stages on weight gain, growth in structural size, and take-off flight speed of juvenile mourning doves Zenaida macroura. Brood size was manipulated during the nestling stage (≤11 days) and feeding rates during the fledgling stage (13-25 days) using a full factorial design. Effects of nutritional stress differed between the two treatments and depended on the response that was measured and the age at which it was measured. Treatment effects on flight ability were delayed and were greater for the treatment during the nestling stage than during the fledgling stage. Immediate treatment effects were greater than delayed effects on weight and size. Young were able to minimize effects of stress on flight ability at early ages when they would be most vulnerable to predation. However, by 90 days birds from enlarged broods were slower and flight time at 90 days was negatively correlated with weight and size at 25 days. There was no evidence for a cost of compensatory growth after experimental treatments ended on flight ability at 90 days. Results suggest that the effects of stress occur in a hierarchical manner across phenotypic components and that at early ages flight ability is prioritized through phenotypic plasticity. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Introduction: Eating disorders are more common in women; especially adolescent girls are at risk. Our objective was to assess whether the adolescent girls were satisfied with their present physical appearance and weight and to analyze their views about their appearance. Subjects and methods: The survey was conducted among female adolescents, aged 16-17, in all secondary schools in Banjaluka, using the Eating Attitudes Test - EAT-26. The response rate was 1956 (87.3%) out of 2240 (total number in the first and second grade female students). Results: Almost half of the students surveyed with BM &lt;18.5 kg/m2 were sometimes dissatisfied with their body image. More than half (54.8%) with BM 18.5-25 kg/m2 were sometimes dissatisfied with their appearance, while 1 of 10 respondents had that feeling often. Nearly 20% declared that they often wanted to be slimmer. With statistically significant differences, the surveyed students with BM &lt;18 kg/m2 stated that they were unaware of calorie value of foods in comparison to students with BM of 18-25 kg/m2 (χ2=63.7, df=24, p=0.000). Nearly 33% of respondents were always, very often, and often familiar with food calorie values. Discussion: Unrealistic idea of the body size can bring out various health risks. The health risks ranges from inadequate child attempts to inability to recognize and stop the weight gain. Conclusion: The survey highlights a need for education of young people in order to accept a healthy lifestyle. © Medicinska naklada.},

abstract={Two 3-month longitudinal studies examined weight loss following a 1-month behavioral intervention (FIT-DSD) focusing on increasing participants' behavioral flexibility and breaking daily habits. The goal was to break the distal habits hypothesized as playing a role in unhealthy dietary and activity behaviors. The FIT-DSD intervention required participants to do something different each day and to engage in novel weekly activities to expand their behavioral repertoire. These activities were not food- or exercise-related. In Study 1, the FIT-DSD program was compared with a control condition where participants engaged in daily tasks not expected to influence behavioral flexibility. Study 2 used an active or quasicontrol group in which half the participants were also on food diets. Measures in both studies were taken pre-, post-, and post-postintervention. In Study 1, FIT-DSD participants showed greater weight loss that continued post-postintervention. In Study 2, all participants on the FIT-DSD program lost weight, weight loss continued post-postintervention, and participants who were also dieting lost no additional weight. A dose relationship was observed between increases in behavioral flexibility scores and weight loss, and this relationship was mediated by calorie intake. Corresponding reductions in BMI were also present. Increasing behavioral flexibility may be an effective approach for tackling obesity and also provides affective and potential life-skill benefits. © 2011 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.},

abstract={Obesity is the single greatest risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with the prevalence of both dramatically increasing in recent years. These conditions are associated with medical complications such as hypertension, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests a greater risk of developing dementia including Alzheimer's disease. The molecular mechanisms governing these changes remain obscure, although epidemiological evidence suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity (a characteristic of T2DM) is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Here we examine the effects of diet-induced insulin resistance on cognitive ability in an animal model not predisposed to develop Alzheimer's pathology. Following 12 weeks on a high fat diet (45% of calories as crude fat) male Wistar rats were overweight and insulin resistant but not frankly diabetic. High fat fed animals were consistently poorer in all aspects of an operant based delayed matching to position task, yet were not impaired in spatial working memory as judged by the open field watermaze test. The cognitive deficit of the HF fed animals was most apparent when the task was switched from matching to non-matching to position, suggestive of an inability to change contingency. Performance in this task was negatively correlated with whole body insulin sensitivity but not weight gain. In conclusion this study has shown that insulin resistant animals exhibit impairments in an operant measure of behavioural flexibility which precede the development of diabetes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The hardiness and mobile nature of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) make them easy to work with but are the same factors that make their responses to behavior-modifying chemical stimuli difficult to evaluate. To overcome these difficulties two bioassays were developed: a two-choice test with airflow and a diffusion-based test to evaluate responses to chemical stimuli. The two-choice assay is excellent for rapidly comparing two stimuli or examining the response to one stimulus against a control. The diffusion assay determines differences in orientation behavior to multiple simultaneous stimuli and can examine other behaviors during exposure. Preparation of individuals for bioassay is also important, because disturbance increases the activity level of individual beetles beyond the duration of the disturbance. The age and the sex of beetles affect responsiveness to chemical cues. These bioassays and a better understanding of T. castaneum's activity have revealed approaches for evaluating its responsiveness to behavior-modifying chemicals. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={Poor self-control, lack of inhibition, and impulsivity contribute to the propensity of adolescents to engage in risky or dangerous behaviors. Brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) involved in impulse-control, reward-processing, and decision-making continue to develop during adolescence, raising the possibility that an immature brain contributes to dangerous behavior during adolescence. However, very few validated animal behavioral models are available for behavioral neuroscientists to explore the relationship between brain development and behavior. To that end, a valid model must be conducted in the relatively brief window of adolescence and not use manipulations that potentially compromise development. The present experiments used three operant arrangements to assess whether adolescent rats differ from adults in measures of learning, behavioral inhibition, and impulsivity, within the aforementioned time frame without substantial food restriction. In Experiment 1, separate squads of rats were trained to lever-press and then transitioned to two types of extinction. Relative to their baselines, adolescent rats responded more during extinction than adults, suggesting that they were less sensitive to the abolishment of the reinforcement contingency. Experiment 2 demonstrated similar age-related differences during exposure to a differential reinforcement of low rates schedule, a test of behavioral inhibition. Lastly, in Experiment 3, adolescent's responding decreased more slowly than adults during exposure to a resetting delay of reinforcement schedule, suggesting impaired self-control. Results from these experiments suggest that adolescents exhibit impaired learning, behavioral inhibition and self-control, and in concert with recent reports, provide researchers with three behavioral models to more fully explore neurobiology of risk-taking behavior in adolescence. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season. Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After 2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2 weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Behavioural traits generally and cognitive traits in particular are relatively understudied in an evolutionary ecological context. One reason for this is that such traits are often difficult to characterize among large numbers of individuals, without the influence of diverse environmental effects swamping intrinsic individual differences. We conducted standardized assays on a natural population of great tits, Parus major, to quantify and characterize individual variation in problem-solving performance, a simple cognitive trait often linked to innovative foraging ability. Forty-four per cent of 570 birds solved a food-motivated, lever-pulling problem and this proportion was consistent across three seasons. Individual performance was consistent within and across captivity sessions, across seasons, and between two different problem-solving tasks (lever and string pulling). Problem-solving performance was not explained by differences in latency to approach the empty task, nor latency to feed after human disturbance. Variation was unrelated to body condition, while age and natal origin explained significant but minimal amounts of variation, the importance of which varied between seasons. Problem-solving performance did not covary with exploration behaviour of a novel environment, suggesting that individual differences in problem solving represent an independent source of behavioural variation in our population. Rather than simply reflecting covariance with state or with other behavioural traits, our results suggest that variation in problem-solving performance represents inherent individual differences in the propensity to forage innovatively. We suggest that standardized problem-solving assays may prove ideal for studying the evolutionary ecology of simple cognitive traits. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Consistent individual differences in the tendency to accept risk have been demonstrated in invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals, including humans. These individual differences have been associated with size, growth rate, survival, and reproductive success. Little research, however, has investigated the effect of developmental environment on individual differences in risk-acceptance. Competing hypotheses offer different explanations of how variation in the quality of the developmental environment affects risk-acceptance in adults. The first hypothesis states that individuals developing in poor quality environments take risks because such behavior is their only means of obtaining adequate fitness returns. The second hypothesis states that individuals developing in poor environments avoid risk because their poor physical condition makes them especially vulnerable to injury or death. We measured several forms of risk-accepting behavior (exploration, foraging, and recovery after disturbance) in male hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) that had developed in nutritional and social environments of varying quality. Individuals raised on poor nutrition diets exhibited lower levels of risk-acceptance than those raised on high nutrition diets. Risk-acceptance among individuals that developed on poor nutrition diets was negatively correlated with body size. We conclude that quality of developmental environment affects risk-acceptance across behavioral contexts in male hissing cockroaches. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that condition-dependent vulnerability mediates the relationship between developmental environment and risk-acceptance. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Purpose: Autism is a multifactorial disorder that involves impairments in social interactions and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. About 30% of individuals with autism develop epilepsy by adulthood. The EL mouse has long been studied as a natural model of multifactorial idiopathic generalized epilepsy with complex partial seizures. Because epilepsy is a comorbid trait of autism, we evaluated the EL mouse for behaviors associated with autism. Methods: We compared the behavior of EL mice to age-matched control DDY mice, a genetically related nonepileptic strain. The mice were compared in the open field and in the light-dark compartment tests to measure activity, exploratory behavior, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. The social transmission of food preference test was employed to evaluate social communication. Home-cage behavior was also evaluated in EL and DDY mice as a measure of repetitive activity. Key Findings: We found that EL mice displayed several behavioral abnormalities characteristic of autism. Impairments in social interaction and restricted patterns of interest were evident in EL mice. Activity, exploratory behavior, and restricted behavior were significantly greater in EL mice than in DDY mice. EL mice exhibited impairment in the social transmission of food preference assay. In addition, a stereotypic myoclonic jumping behavior was observed in EL mice, but was not seen in DDY mice. It is of interest to note that seizure activity within 24 h of testing exacerbated the autistic behavioral abnormalities found in EL mice. Significance: These findings suggest that the EL mouse expresses behavioral abnormalities similar to those seen in persons with autism. We propose that the EL mouse can be utilized as a natural model of autism and epilepsy. © 2010 International League Against Epilepsy.},

abstract={Life-history plasticity is widespread among organisms. However, an important question is whether it is adaptive. Most models for plasticity in life-history timing predict that animals, once they have reached the minimal nutritional threshold under poor conditions, will accelerate development or time to reproduction. Adaptive delays in reproduction are not common, especially in short-lived species. Examples of adaptive reproductive delays exist in mammalian populations experiencing strong interspecific (e. g., predation) and intraspecific (e. g., infanticide) competition. But are there other environmental factors that may trigger an adaptive delay in reproductive timing? We show that the short-lived flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis will delay reproduction under nutrient-poor conditions, even though it has already met the minimal nutritional threshold for reproduction. We test whether this delay strategy is an adaptive response allowing the scavenger time to locate more resources by experimentally providing supplemental protein pulses (early, mid and late) throughout the reproductive delay period. Flies receiving additional protein produced more and larger eggs, demonstrating a benefit of the delay. In addition, by tracking the allocation of carbon from the pulses using stable isotopes, we show that flies receiving earlier pulses incorporated more carbon into eggs and somatic tissue than those given a later pulse. These results indicate that the reproductive delay in S. crassipalpis is consistent with adaptive post-threshold plasticity, a nutritionally linked reproductive strategy that has not been reported previously in an invertebrate species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Early life stress is a prominent risk factor for the development of adult psychopathology. Numerous studies have shown that early life stress leads to persistent changes in behavioral and endocrine responses to stress. However, despite recent findings of gene expression changes and structural abnormalities in neurons of the forebrain neocortex, little is known about specific cognitive deficits that can result from early life stress. Here we examined five cognitive functions in two inbred strains of mice, the stress-resilient strain C57Bl/6 and the stress-susceptible strain Balb/c, which were exposed to an infant maternal separation paradigm and raised to adulthood. Between postnatal ages P60 to P90, mice underwent a series of tests examining five cognitive functions: Recognition memory, spatial working memory, associative learning, shifts of attentional sets, and reversal learning. None of these functions were impaired in IMS C57Bl/6 mice. In contrast, IMS Balb/c mice exhibited deficits in spatial working memory and extradimensional shifts of attention, that is, functions governed primarily by the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, like recently discovered changes in frontocortical gene expression, the emergence of specific cognitive deficits associated with the medial prefrontal cortex is also strain-specific. These findings illustrate that early life stress can indeed affect specific cognitive functions in adulthood, and they support the hypothesis that the genetic background and environmental factors are critical determinants in the development of adult cognitive deficits in subjects with a history of early life stress. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess early infant-feeding patterns in a cohort of low-income black mothers and to examine associations between maternal perception of infant temperament and complementary feeding (CF) before 4 months. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the 3-month visit (n = 217) of the Infant Care, Feeding and Risk of Obesity Study to assess relationships between early feeding of solids or juice and 6 dimensions of perceived infant temperament. Descriptive statistics were used to assess infant-feeding patterns, and logistic regression models were fit for each diet-temperament relationship found significant in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of the infants were fed solid foods at 3 months, 25% were fed juice, and 6% were exclusively breastfed. In multivariable analyses, 2 dimensions of perceived infant temperament were associated with early feeding of solid foods (distress-tolimitations odds ratio [OR]: 1.97 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-3.44]; activity-level OR: 1.75 [95% CI: 1.07-2.85]), whereas 1 dimension, low-intensity pleasure, was associated with early feeding of juice (OR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.34-0.78]). Maternal characteristics significantly associated with early CF included breastfeeding, obesity, and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Low-income black mothers may represent a priority population for interventions aimed at improving adherence to optimal infant feeding recommendations. That maternal perceptions of several domains of perceived infant temperament are related to early CF suggests that this is an important factor to include in future observational research and in the design of interventions.

abstract={The periodicity of increment formation in the shell of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum was investigated in the subtidal zone of the Auray River estuary (South Brittany, France). Calcein markings were performed at different periods between May and October 2007 using in situ benthic chambers tented by scuba divers. This study shows that shell microgrowth increments were well-defined and deposited with a tidal periodicity in the subtidal zone, providing the calendar base for high-resolution ecological studies and environmental reconstruction from these R. philippinarum shells. Endogenous rhythmicity in shell microgrowth increment formation and oxygen consumption was previously documented in this species from intertidal flats. Our study suggests that, in the subtidal zone, Manila clams' rhythmic activity may be controlled by such an endogenous process, synchronized by tidal cues. As in other bivalves, R. philippinarum is an osmoconformer euryhaline bivalve. The tidal rhythmicity of shell microgrowth increments in subtidal specimens of this species could be explained by a behavioral adaptation of valve closure at low tide to protect the clam from low salinities and/or to synchronize with food availability. Finally, large inter-individual variability in tidally associated growth rates and asynchronous growth breaks were observed, and could be due to genetic variability between individuals, asynchronous partial spawning events or predation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Predator-induced defences have been demonstrated in numerous marine molluscs, but never in giant clams (Bivalvia: Tridacnidae). Water-borne cues from the predatory crab Myomenippe hardwickii were tested for their ability to induce changes in the shell morphology, strength and growth of juvenile fluted giant clams, Tridacna squamosa. Specimens were maintained in effluent from tanks holding 'fed crabs', 'starved crabs' and 'no crabs'. To ensure changes were due to predator cues only, food for the crabs was provided ex situ and measures were taken to minimise the prey signal. After 182 days, MANOVA identified differences in various shell parameters relating to shape and strength. CDA showed a clear change in overall morphology, with strong separation among the three treatments. Effluent from 'fed crabs' had a greater influence than effluent from 'starved crabs', possibly because the starved crabs were perceived as weaker, and thus less risk. Significantly more clams died in 'fed crabs' treatments (25%) and 'starved crabs' treatments (30%) compared to the 'no crabs' control (0%). This degree of mortality has not been observed in similar experiments elsewhere and represents a new challenge to interpret. We suggest that the cause is unlikely to be related to the plastic responses, but rather a result of some form of crab-associated contaminant. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Body weight gain is one of the most serious side effects associated with clinical use of antipsychotics. However, the mechanisms by which antipsychotics induce body weight gain are unknown, and no reliable animal models of antipsychotics-induced weight gain have been established. The present studies were designed to establish male rat models of weight gain induced by chronic and acute treatment with antipsychotics. Six-week chronic treatment with olanzapine (5, 7.5, and 10. mg/kg/day) in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a daily diet resembling a human macronutrient diet, significantly increased body weight gain and weight of fatty tissues. In contrast, ziprasidone (1.25, 2.5, and 5. mg/kg/day) administration caused no observable adverse effects. We then investigated feeding behavior with acute antipsychotic treatment in male rats using an automated food measurement apparatus. Rats were allowed restricted access to normal laboratory chow (4. h/day). With acute olanzapine (0.5, 1, and 2. mg/kg, i.p.) treatment in the light phase, food intake volume and duration were significantly increased, while treatment with ziprasidone (0.3, 1, and 3. mg/kg, i.p.) did not increase food intake volume or meal time duration. Findings from the present studies showed that chronic treatment with olanzapine in male rats induced body weight gain, and acute injection induced hyperphagia, suggesting that hyperphagia may be involved in the weight gain and obesity-inducing properties of chronically administered olanzapine. These animal models may provide useful experimental platforms for analysis of the mechanism of hyperphagia and evaluating the potential risk of novel antipsychotics to induce weight gain in humans. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study investigated the role of H1 receptor in the state-dependent memory deficit induced by l-histidine (LH) in mice using Trial 1/2 protocol in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). The test was performed for two consecutive days: Trial 1 (T1) and Trial 2 (T2). Before both trials, mice received a combined injection i.p. of saline+saline (SAL/SAL), 500mg/kg l-histidine+saline (LH/SAL), 500mg/kg l-histidine+16mg/kg chlorpheniramine (LH/CPA) or saline+16mg/kg chlorpheniramine (SAL/CPA). The trials were performed in the EPM 10min after the last injection. Each animal was placed in the center of the maze facing the open arm and had five minutes to explore it. On both days, test sessions were videotaped. The behavioral measures were scored from videotape. Data were analyzed based on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Fisher's LSD test. The data showed no effects on anxiety since there was no difference between the SAL/SAL and the other groups in Trial 1, respectively, open arm entries (OAE), open arm time (OAT) and their percentages (%OAE and %OAT). During Trial 2, OAE, OAT, %OAE and %OAT were reduced in mice treated with SAL/SAL, LH/CPA and SAL/CPA, while the group LH/SAL did not show any difference in these measures. No significant changes were observed in enclosed arm entries (EAE), an EPM index of general exploratory activity. Thus, it can be suggested that LH induces emotional memory deficit and the treatment with chlorpheniramine was able to revert this effect, suggesting this action of LH was mediated by the H1 receptor. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread in the environment, human food and breast milk. Seafood is known to contain nutrients beneficial for the normal development and function of the brain, but also contaminants such as PCBs which are neurotoxic. Exposure to non-coplanar PCBs during brain development can disrupt spontaneous behaviour in mice and lead to hyperactive behaviour. Humans are chronically exposed to the highest relative levels of organochlorines in early childhood during brain development, though usually at doses which do not give clinical symptoms of toxicity. This study aimed to elucidate the developmental and behavioural effects of 2,2',4,4',5,5' hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) in mice, mimicking human exposure during gestation and lactation.Methods: Environmentally relevant doses of PCB153 were added to the experimental diets. Feed concentrations were approximately 0.5, 6.5, and 1500 μg PCB153/kg feed, representing a realistic and a worst case scenario of frequent consumption of contaminated fish. The study also investigated the effects of maternal nutrition, i.e. a standard rodent diet versus a high inclusion of salmon. Mice pups were examined for physical- and reflex development, sensorimotor function and spontaneous behaviour from five days after birth until weaning. A selection of pups were followed until 16 weeks of age and tested for open field behaviour and the acoustic startle response (ASR) with prepulse inhibition (PPI). Blood thyroid hormones and liver enzymes, blood lipids and PCB153 content in fat were examined at 16 weeks. Statistical analyses modelled the three way interactions of diet, PCB exposure and litter size on behaviour, using generalized linear models (GLM) and linear mixed effect models (LME). The litter was used as a random variable. Non-parametric tests were used for pair wise comparisons of biochemical analyses.Results: Litter size consistently influenced pup development and behaviour. Few lasting PCB153 related changes were observed, but results indicated effects on synchronization of physical development. Perinatal PCB153 exposure appeared to reduce habituation and cause aggression in males, though not statistically significant.Conclusions: Litter size and maternal diet influenced physical development and function more than PCB153 in perinatally exposed mouse pups and supports the developmental importance of maternal care and the social environment. © 2011 Haave et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Many vertebrate species alter their reproductive behavior under stressful conditions. Available evidence in wild birds suggests that under food limitation, parents reduce overall provisioning rate while increasing selectivity of food distribution within brood in favor of senior siblings. However, how acute stressors such as predation risk influence the magnitude and direction of changes in parental provisioning is poorly understood. In this study, a small passerine bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), was used as a model species to investigate parental provisioning strategies when exposed to different types of predators. Parents reduced provisioning rates remarkably when exposed to a predator of adults, whereas no behavioral change was observed when nest predation was imitated. Under normal conditions, parents preferred senior chicks to juniors. In contrast to experiments with food limitation, parents allocated food equally to senior and junior siblings under predation risk, irrespective of the type of a predator. No sex-related differences in parental provisioning strategies were found. We conclude that parents alter several aspects of their behavior in response to fear stress. If danger to parents occurs repeatedly, temporal reductions in provisioning rates may have cumulative and potentially harmful consequences on offspring performance. © The Author 2010.},

abstract={This paper describes a novel combination of feeding motivation and spatial preference testing. We used the feeding motivation test to determine a 'low' barrier height that broiler chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, that were not food deprived would cross to get to food, and a 'high' barrier height that food-deprived chickens would cross to get to food. These barriers were then used to assess the chickens' spatial preferences. Birds could show their spatial preference by moving between two compartments with different stocking densities (14.7birds/m2 in a compartment of fixed size versus 9.3, 12.1 or 14.7birds/m2 in a compartment of adjustable size). The compartments were separated by either the low or the high barrier. In the density preference test, the number of birds in the adjustable compartment increased with increasing size of this compartment, indicating that birds preferred lower densities, an effect that became more pronounced with age. This effect occurred even when a barrier was used that had previously deterred 20-25% of birds from crossing to get to food after 6h of food deprivation, suggesting that achieving a lower density was important to the broiler chickens. Since this methodology does not involve training, it could be used to evaluate the importance of spatial or other preferences in a wide range of domestic and nondomestic species. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Aggression is often positively correlated with other behavioural traits such as boldness and activity levels. Comparisons across populations can help to determine factors that promote the evolution of such traits. We quantified these behaviours by testing the responses of wild-caught poeciliid fish, Brachyrhaphis episcopi, to mirror image stimuli. This species occurs in populations that experience either high or low levels of predation pressure. Previous studies have shown that B. episcopi from low predation environments are less bold than those that occur with many predators. We therefore predicted that fish from high predation populations would be more aggressive and more active than fish from low predation populations. However, we found the opposite - low predation fish approached a mirror and a novel object more frequently than high predation fish suggesting that 'boldness' and aggression were higher in low predation populations, and that population-level boldness measures may vary depending on context. When tested individually, low predation fish inspected their mirror image more frequently. Females, but not males, from low predation sites were also more aggressive towards their mirror image. Variation in female aggression may be driven by a trade-off between food availability and predation risk. This suggests that the relationship between aggression and boldness has been shaped by adaptation to environmental conditions, and not genetic constraints. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Ecosystems are intricately linked by the flow of organisms across their boundaries, and such connectivity can be essential to the structure and function of the linked ecosystems. For example, many coral reef fish populations are maintained by the movement of individuals from spatially segregated juvenile habitats (i. e., nurseries, such as mangroves and seagrass beds) to areas preferred by adults. It is presumed that nursery habitats provide for faster growth (higher food availability) and/or low predation risk for juveniles, but empirical data supporting this hypothesis is surprisingly lacking for coral reef fishes. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms (growth, predation risk, and reproductive investment) that give rise to the distribution patterns of a common Caribbean reef fish species, Haemulon flavolineatum (French grunt). Adults were primarily found on coral reefs, whereas juvenile fish only occurred in non-reef habitats. Contrary to our initial expectations, analysis of length-at-age revealed that growth rates were highest on coral reefs and not within nursery habitats. Survival rates in tethering trials were 0% for small juvenile fish transplanted to coral reefs and 24-47% in the nurseries. As fish grew, survival rates on coral reefs approached those in non-reef habitats (56 vs. 77-100%, respectively). As such, predation seems to be the primary factor driving across-ecosystem distributions of this fish, and thus the primary reason why mangrove and seagrass habitats function as nursery habitat. Identifying the mechanisms that lead to such distributions is critical to develop appropriate conservation initiatives, identify essential fish habitat, and predict impacts associated with environmental change. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={Terrestrial animals live in an environment that undergoes regular variations, ultimately induced by the geophysical conditions prevailing in our solar/Earth system. Solar radiation and gravity, in combination with the Earth's rotation around its inclined axis and its orbit around the sun, and the moon's revolution around Earth, produce marked diurnal, seasonal and lunar as well as tidal periodicities in important physical environmental factors, such as light intensity, ambient temperature, humidity, precipitation, day and night length, and duration of twilight. As a consequence of the superimposition of these periodicities on one another, many relevant biotic environmental factors, such as food availability and predator pressure, as well as social contact, communication and competition with conspecifics, and intra- and interspecific competition for food may also vary diurnally, seasonally, lunar periodically or tidally. In this way, each animal's environment has a highly complex time structure, is highly repetitive in time and thus highly predictable. Reliable predictability provides a good substrate for genetically fixed adaptations. Hence, in addition to other general or specific physiological, ecological and/or behavioural adaptations, animals have also evolved endogenous diurnal (circadian), annual (circannual), lunar (circalunar) and/or tidal (circatidal) rhythms.
In non-human primates (hereafter ‘primates’), adaptation to the time structure of the physical and biotic environment is restricted mainly to the development of a circadian timing system, which is involved in the regulation of the pronounced daily (circadian) organization of physiology and behaviour. © Cambridge University Press 2011.},

abstract={Infantile colic is a behavioural syndrome of early childhood that is associated with irritability and crying. It self-resolves, but may lead to significant parental strife. The etiology is unknown; however, several investigators have examined the effect of nutrition on infantile colic. For the majority of infants, nutritional interventions appear to have no benefit on infantile colic. However, a minority of infants may display symptoms of infantile colic secondary to a cow's milk protein allergy. In these cases, a maternal hypoallergenic diet for breastfed infants and an extensively hydrolyzed formula for bottle-fed infants may result in resolution of colic. There is no proven role for the use of soy-based formulas or of lactase therapy in the management of infantile colic, and these interventions are not recommended. Currently, there are insufficient data to make a recommendation on the effect of probiotics for infantile colic. In all cases of infantile colic, it is important to ensure that there is sufficient parental support available.},

abstract={Sleeping site selection is an important aspect of the behavioral biology of primates. Comparison of different habitats for the same species in this context enhances understanding of their adaptation to altered environments. We collected data on sleep-related behaviors for 6 groups of Francois's langur (Trachypithecus francoisi) in two habitats, in Mayanghe National Nature Reserve, Guizhou, China. Regardless of habitat, all sleeping sites were located in areas of steep terrain of ≥60°. In undisturbed habitat, sleeping sites were located only in evergreen broadleaf forest with rock caves and crevices surrounded mainly by a vegetation layer of shrub + rock. In disturbed habitat, sleeping sites were also located in mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest and in grassland, including rock caves, crevices, and pits, surrounded mainly by arbor + shrub and shrub + rock. Wild food availability was higher in undisturbed habitat than disturbed habitat, but food abundance around sleeping sites was lower. Water sources included river and seasonal gully or pond. There was strong positive correlation between use of sleeping sites away from the river valley and occurrence of seasonal water sources. The number of sleeping sites varied across groups, numbering 6, 7, and 10 for three specific groups. Few sleeping sites were used all year round. Six consecutive nights was the longest recorded run. Francois's langurs' sleeping habits differed between two habitats. In undisturbed habitat, minimizing predation risk appeared to predominate, expressed by choosing steep terrain, open visual field, and inconspicuous presleeping behavior. In disturbed habitat, along with predation avoidance, food resources may strongly influence sleeping site selection, as demonstrated by the richer food abundance and greater foraging activity around the site. Finally, water resources may influence choice of sites distant from the river; such sites were used less frequently during water shortages. © 2010 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Substantial evidence suggests a role for nutrition in the management of AD and especially suggests that interventions with combinations of nutrients are more effective than single-nutrient interventions. The specific multi-nutrient combination Fortasyn™Connect (FC), shown to improve memory in AD, provides phosphatide precursors and cofactors and is designed to stimulate the formation of phospholipids, neuronal membranes, and synapses. The composition comprises nucleotides, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3 PUFA), choline, B-vitamins, phospholipids, and antioxidants. The current study explored the protective properties of FC in a membrane toxicity model of AD, the amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ42) infused rat, which shows reduced exploratory behavior in an Open Field and impaired cholinergic functioning. To this end, rats were fed an FC enriched diet or a control diet and five weeks later infused with vehicle or Aβ42 into the lateral ventricle. Ten weeks post-infusion Aβ42-rats fed the FC diet showed increased membrane n3 PUFA and phosphatidylcholine content while they did not show the reductions in exploratory behavior or in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) immunoreactivity that were seen in Aβ42-rats fed the control diet. We conclude that FC protects the cholinergic system against Aβ42-induced toxicity and speculate that the effects of FC on membrane formation and composition might be supportive for this protective effect. Based on these data a long-term intervention study was started in the prodromal stages of AD (NTR1705, LipiDiDiet, EU FP7). © 2011-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Insectivorous birds rely on a short period of food abundance to feed their young; they must time their reproduction to match the timing of Lepidoptera larvae, their main prey. Apart from the net result (i. e. birds are timed or mistimed with respect to the food's peak), an important aspect is the possible influence of other factors, such as the seasonality of the environment or the abundance and diversity of species contributing to the caterpillar peak, on birds' phenology and their ability to cope well with unpredictable food supplies. In a 2-year study, we explored the seasonal variation of nestling diet in Mediterranean blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and how reproductive parameters (nestling condition, provisioning rates) are affected by the phenology and composition of food. We also examined the influence of the synchrony between offspring needs and caterpillar peak in shaping the composition of the nestlings' diet. We found that the effect of synchrony on nestling condition varied between years which may be partially due to differences in food peak attributes. The adequacy of birds' timing in relation to prey phenology affected foraging decisions; those birds that were not able to correctly adjust their timing were forced to rely on less preferred prey (tortricids). In this sense, we found that relative contribution of tortricids (smaller caterpillars but easier to get) and noctuids (preferred prey but more difficult to find) to the diet influenced nestling condition and parental provisioning effort; parents performed fewer feeding events and reared heavier nestlings as the contribution of noctuids to the diet increased. The relationship between the proportion of caterpillars and nestling mass was curvilinear, whereas that parameter was negatively affected by the percentage of pupae. Our results show how changes in diet composition may contribute to explain the effect of mismatching on birds' breeding performance. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

When challenged by parasites and pathogens, prey with poor immune functions are thus likely to be at a selective disadvantage. We tested the hypothesis that predation by birds selects for increased immune function in a wild population of male damselflies Calopteryx splendens, while controlling for a trait known to be under selection by bird predation, dark wing-spots. We found that selection on both immune function and wing-spot size was significantly positive, and that selection on either trait was independent of selection on the other. We found no evidence of nonlinear quadratic or correlational selection. In contrast to previous studies, we found no phenotypic correlation between immune function and wingspot size. There was also no difference in immune response between territorial and non-territorial males. Our study suggests that predation may be an important agent of selection on the immune systems of prey, and because the selection we detected was directional, has the potential to cause phenotypic change in populations. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The US egg industry is being pressured from many directions to change its production practices, particularly to address concerns about hen welfare in conventional cage systems. Responding to similar pressures, in 1999, the European Union banned conventional laying cages starting in 2012. This now impending European ban has led to the development of everal alternative housing systems. These include noncage systems like aviaries and modified (enriched or furnished) cages that include perches, areas in which the hens can forage and dustbathe, and nests. Understanding the European experience is valuable as the United States considers the future direction of the egg industry. In the United States, the proportion of eggs produced in alternative systems is small (less than 5% of output) but growing, in part due to market and political incentives for systems that provide hens with more behavioral freedom than conventional cages. Animal welfare, however, is only one element of a sustainable production system. Other elements include those related to public values, the environment, economics, worker health, and food safety and quality. Eggs are a primary source of animal protein globally, and the United States is the third largest producer of eggs in the world, behind China and the European Union. The national table egg flock comprises about 280 million hens housed in all regions but with approximately 60% of eggs produced in the 10 leading states. Adopting new housing systems will have substantial effects on costs and other aspects of egg production on both a regional and national scale, with some positive effects but also potential negative effects that need to be carefully considered. This paper discusses the US egg industry in the context of legislation and standards related to hen housing systems. It also addresses initiatives by retailers, nongovernmental organizations, and private certification organizations to shape production practices in the egg industry as well as how those initiatives might affect various aspects of the sustainability of egg production. © 2011 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

abstract={Foraging theory was first developed to predict the behaviour of widely-foraging animals that actively search for prey. Although the behaviour of sit-and-wait predators often follows predictions derived from foraging theory, the similarity between these two distinct groups of predators is not always obvious. In this review, we compare foraging activities of trap-building predators (mainly pit-building antlions and web-building spiders), a specific group of sit-and-wait predators that construct traps as a foraging device, with those of widely-foraging predators. We refer to modifications of the trap characteristics as analogous to changes in foraging intensity. Our review illustrates that the responses of trap-building and widely-foraging predators to different internal and external factors, such as hunger level, conspecific density and predation threat are quite similar, calling for additional studies of foraging theory using trap-building predators. In each chapter of this review, we summarize the response of trap-building predators to a different factor, while contrasting it with the equivalent response characterizing widely-foraging predators. We provide here evidence that the behaviour of trap-building predators is not stereotypic or fixed as was once commonly accepted, rather it can vary greatly, depending on the individual's internal state and its interactions with external environmental factors. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Atlantic salmon exhibit massive variation in growth, and here we review the patterns and allometric, genotypic, maternal and environmental sources of the variation. However, growth is also behaviourally flexible and influenced by behavioural trade-offs with survival-related traits. We suggest a conceptual framework that addresses growth variation throughout the salmon life cycle based on such behavioural trade-offs. Under this framework both seasonal freshwater growth variation and the large difference in growth between fresh water and sea water are related to the trade-off between feeding to maximise growth and sheltering to avoid predation under different seasonal conditions and habitat characteristics. A link has recently been established between female spawning behaviour and variation in offspring growth (through local density regulation of growth), further emphasising the importance of behavioural traits for growth variation. Finally, growth is also state-dependent, with growth being accelerated or depressed according to physiological or life-history states. No model has so far been developed that accounts for the complex interactions of abiotic factors, biotic interactions, physiological and life-history states and the behavioural flexibility of growth. However, even the simple temperature-driven growth models have proven their value as baselines for Atlantic salmon performance. Currently, field-based models are being developed that incorporate more sources of growth variation, and if extended into generic models they should become valuable tools in many aspects of the science and management of Atlantic salmon. © 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

abstract={Antipredator behavior is triggered by a combination of internal proximate mechanisms (anatomical receptors and the physiological processes that regulate their function) and external environmental cues that signal the context and timing of when behavior is likely to be effective. Responses to some external environmental triggers, such as the presence of conspecific chemical alarm cue, are governed strictly by genetic templates. Other external environmental triggers are learned through a special type of associative learning called releaser-induced recognition learning. Zebrafish are one of several model systems upon which this body of literature has been developed. Minnows (including zebrafish) associate danger with any novel stimulus (visual, chemical, or auditory) that is correlated with the presence of chemical alarm cue released from damaged epithelial tissue of conspecifics. Alarm cue is released only in the context of predation and serves as a reliable external environmental trigger for associating novel stimuli with predation risk. Minnows use learned recognition to learn about predator identity and about the chemical alarm cues of ecologically similar heterospecifics. Learning also occurs when alarm cues are released indirectly through the digestive tract of the predator. Behavioral and chemical responses to disturbance can also facilitate learned recognition. Learned recognition is an ideal system with which to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie the cognitive processes of learning and memory. Collectively, this suggests that zebrafish are a very promising model organism for future study. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The extra-fine, soft and warm fibres used by the textile industry for manufacturing high-quality, luxury textiles are obtained from the undercoat hair of several domestic mammals of the genera Capra, Bos, Camelus, and Lama. The demand for ‘speciality fibres’ by the fashion world represents an important opportunity for livelihoods, on condition that conservation of the wild species is preserved. Large scale trade of hair from wild goats hunted for meat or trophy and hybridisation of wild (Capra ibex) and domestic (Capra hircus) goats or wild Vicuna (Lama vicugna) and domestic Alpaca (Lama pacos), with the aim of improving fibre fineness and yield, would involve a risk of genetic pollution and would severely threaten conservation and biodiversity. This work describes fibre morphology and cell structure of fine fibres from the most important wild and domestic fibre producing species with the aim of enhancing traits for identification purposes. Microscopy investigation shows that exposure to thermal and nutritional stresses in the wild, lead to finer hair associated with lower rate of growth, yielding orientation and elongation of the cuticle cells. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals specie-specific differences in the internal structure of the fibre cortex, probably related to the process of hair keratinisation. © 2011, SAGE Publications.

The results of animal and human experimental studies suggest a causal relationship between mastication and cognition.

abstract={The use of chemical cues to recognize elevated risk of predation is widespread in crustaceans and the responses to chemical cues can decrease the risk of predation. There are multiple sources of such cues: odors from damaged conspecifics, damaged heterospecifics, conspecifics digested by predators, predator odors, and odors associated with predation risk by learning. The most common responses to such odors are behaviors such as decreased movement or movement away from the source of cues, but in small planktonic species development of defensive morphologies such as spines also occurs. When faced with combinations of chemical cues, such as danger cues and food cues, most crustaceans respond primarily to the danger cue. Starvation can eliminate the dominance of danger cues over food cues. In the crab Heterozius rotundifrons, there is no response to chemical cues indicating increased predation risk unless tactile cues are also detected. Learned associations can result in crustaceans showing responses to cues that in themselves may be weak indicators of elevated predation risk. More field work is needed to document the extent to which patterns reported from the laboratory are important in nature. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the present article the putative role of environmental factors in schizophrenia is reviewed and synthesized. Accumulating evidence from recent studies suggests that environmental exposures may play a more significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than previously thought. This expanding knowledge base is largely a consequence of refinements in the methodology of epidemiologic studies, including birth cohort investigations, and in preclinical research that has been inspired by the evolving literature on animal models of environmental exposures. This paper is divided into four sections. In the first, the descriptive epidemiology of schizophrenia is reviewed. This includes general studies on incidence, prevalence, and differences in these measures by urban-rural, neighborhood, migrant, and season of birth status, as well as time trends. In the second section, we discuss the contribution of environmental risk factors acting during fetal and perinatal life; these include infections [e.g. rubella, influenza, Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)], nutritional deficiencies (e.g., famine, folic acid, iron, vitamin D), paternal age, fetal/neonatal hypoxic and other obstetric insults and complications, maternal stress and other exposures [e.g. lead, rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, maternal stress]. Other putative neurodevelopmental determinants, including cannabis, socioeconomic status, trauma, and infections during childhood and adolescence are also covered. In the third section, these findings are synthesized and their implications for prevention and uncovering biological mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, are discussed. Animal models, including maternal immune activation, have yielded evidence suggesting that these exposures cause brain and behavioral phenotypes that are analogous to findings observed in patients with schizophrenia. In the final section, future studies including new, larger, and more rigorous epidemiologic investigations, and research on translational and clinical neuroscience, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, developmental trajectories and windows of vulnerability, are elaborated upon. These studies are aimed at confirming observed risk factors, identifying new environmental exposures, elucidating developmental mechanisms, and shedding further light on genes and exposures that may not be identified in the absence of these integrated approaches. The study of environmental factors in schizophrenia may have important implications for the identification of causes and prevention of this disorder, and offers the potential to complement, and refine, existing efforts on explanatory neurodevelopmental models. © 2010.},

abstract={At every moment, the natural world presents animals with two fundamental pragmatic problems: selection between actions that are currently possible, and specification of the parameters or metrics of those actions. It is commonly suggested that the brain addresses these by first constructing representations of the world on which to build knowledge and make a decision, and then by computing and executing an action plan. However, neurophysiological data argues against this serial viewpoint. In contrast, it is proposed here that the brain processes sensory information to specify, in parallel, several potential actions that are currently available. These potential actions compete against each other for further processing, while information is collected to bias that competition until a single response is selected. The hypothesis suggests that the dorsal visual system specifies actions which compete against each other within the fronto-parietal cortex, while a variety of biasing influences are provided by prefrontal regions and the basal ganglia. A computational model is described which illustrates how that competition may take place in the cerebral cortex. Simulations of the model capture qualitative features of neurophysiological data and reproduce various behavioural phenomena. At every moment, the natural environment presents animals with many opportunities and demands for action. The presence of food offers an opportunity to satiate hunger, while the appearance of a predator demands caution or evasion. An animal cannot perform all of these behaviours at the same time because they often share the same effectors (you only have two hands; you can only transport yourself in one direction at a time, etc.). Thus, one fundamental issue faced by every behaving creature is the question of action selection. That question must be resolved, in part, by using external sensory information about objects in the world, and in part, by using internal information about current behavioural needs. © Cambridge University Press 2012.},

abstract={Aim: To determine the constellation of lifestyle and demographic factors that are associated with poor mental health in an adolescent population. Methods: The Raine Study 14-year follow-up involved primary care givers and their adolescent children (n= 1860). The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was used to assess adolescent mental health. We examined diet, socio-demographic data, family functioning, physical activity, screen use and risk-taking behaviours with mental health outcomes using linear regression. Results: Adolescents with higher intakes of meat and meat alternatives and 'extras' foods had poorer mental health status. Adverse socio-economic conditions, higher hours of screen use and ever partaking in the health risk behaviours of smoking and early sexual activity were significantly associated with increasing CBCL scores, indicative of poorer functioning. Conclusions: By identifying the lifestyle and demographic factors that accompany poorer mental health in early adolescence, we are able to better understand the context of mental health problems as they occur within an adolescent population. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={The thrifty phenotype hypothesis is widely used to interpret associations between early nutritional experience and degenerative disease risks. However, it remains unclear what is adaptive about early life thrift, and biomedical approaches struggle to explain why associations between early growth and later disease hold across the entire range of birth size. This issue can be addressed using a simple model, attributing disease to a high metabolic load (large tissue masses, rich diet, and sedentary lifestyle) relative to metabolic capacity (physiological traits contingent on fetal/infant development). In this context, different hypotheses regarding the long-term functions of thrift can be examined. The "predictive adaptive response" hypothesis considers thrift to involve metabolic adaptations (insulin resistance and central adiposity) that emerge in anticipation of a poor quality adult breeding environment. The competing "maternal capital" hypothesis considers thrift to involve reductions in lean mass and organ phenotype arising through constraints on maternal phenotype, reflecting both maternal developmental experience and current ecological conditions. This hypothesis assumes offspring developmental responses to stresses such as temperature, altitude, and nutritional ecology occur under the influence of maternal capital indices, including size, physiology, reproductive history and social status. I argue that insulin resistance only emerges after infancy, and far from being anticipatory of a low nutritional plane, indicates perturbations of metabolism. Following exposure of early thrifty growth to the obesogenic niche. Thrift as early growth variability represents a plausible profile of developmental plasticity for human evolutionary history, aiding understand how the modern obesogenic environment interacts with physiological variability to induce disease. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={The objective of this work is to present a review about the concept of resilience, its biological aspects, the way we can try to measure it and some possible interventions. In Spanish, the term resiliencia is taken from the English word resilience or resiliency, term originally used in thermodynamics. In biological sciences, resilience is defined as «the capability of an ecosystem or organism to recover its steadiness after it has suffered an alteration». In psychosocial research, Rutter defines resilience as «the relative resistance to the psychosocial experiences of risk». For the resilience process to take place, it is necessary that individuals become exposed to an important stress and adversity load, and their efforts to contend them result in a positive adaptation in spite of suffering aggressions throughout the developmental process. When facing significant stress, three potential responses can be anticipated: 1. That individuals at risk show a better evolution than expected; 2. That a positive adaptation remains in spite of stressing experiences; or 3. That individuals reach an acceptable recovery after a trauma. The physiological response to the acute stress involves several neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones, which have functional interactions that may produce a psychobiological response in the face of the acute stress and long term psychiatric consequences because they mediate mechanisms and neuronal paths that regulate reward, fear conditioning and social behavior. Cortisol, corticotropinreleasing hormone, norepinephrine, galanin, neuropeptide Y, dopamine and serotonin are some of the substances (physiological [or stress] mediators) implicated. After important stress exposure, we can say that a person has a resilient profile if his/her dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), neuropeptide Y, galanin, testosterone, 1A serotonin receptor (5HT1A) and benzodiazepine receptor levels are increased at the time that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the locus coeruleus system functions are diminished. The biological factors associated with the acute and chronic stress can be considered a measure of resilience. For this purpose, the term allostasis, defined as the adaptive physiological response against the acute stress, has been proposed. Ideally, once the acute stress is suppressed, the individual is capable of recovering the state of homeostasis. However, if this does not occur and adaptive response against the acute stress persists or decreases only partially, it results in a harmful cumulative effect on the physiological and psychological functions of the individual. This phenomenon is denominated «allostatic load». To evaluate the allostatic load it is necessary to incorporate information on the «usual» levels of each individual's allostasis, and to evaluate the dynamics of the systems and the parameters of the main regulation systems. The parameters to evaluate the allostatic load are: a) Arterial systolic pressure >148 mmHg and arterial diastolic pressure >83 mmHg, which are the cardiovascular activity index; b) Waist-hip index > 0.94, that reflects the chronic metabolism function and the disposition of body fat; c) The total cholesterol/high density lipids (HDL)relation in serum >5.9, related with the development of atherosclerosis; d) Glycosylated hemoglobin levels >7.1%, to identify the average of plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time; e) Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) <350 ng/ml, a functional antagonist of the HPAA; f) Nocturnal urinary cortisol excretion ratio >25.7 ug/g creatinine, which measures the 12 hours HPAA activity; g) Nocturnal urinary adrenaline >48 ug/g creatinine, and noradrenaline excretion >5 ug/g creatinine; this test integrates the 12-hours indexes of the sympathetic nervous system activity. The appropriate study of resilience requires consideration to other aspects influencing its nature besides the biological ones. Some of them are: a) The risk factors, defined as events or conditions of adversity associated with the presence of psychopathology or dysfunctional development; b) The vulnerability factors, that is, the features, genetic biases and environmental or biological deficiencies which increase the stress and risk factors response; and c) The protective factors, described as features, contextual characteristics and interventions that promote the resistance, or moderate the effects, to the risk factors. The protective factors are associated with health and functional development; therefore, they promote resilience and offer new options to cope with the event. These factors are studied in three areas: those characteristic of children, in the family atmosphere and in the community. The characteristic factors of children are: intelligence, temperament, flexibility, sense of humor and self-esteem. Related to these a number of annotations have been made. For instance, in certain individual intelligence is modified due to a sequence of stress exposure, like family violence. Individuals with a «resistant» personality experience more trust and are better prepared to apply their abilities and take advantage of their social support; likewise, cooperativeness, kindliness and tolerance are characteristics that could help the child to deal with the presence of harsh conditions; and finally, people with a high opinion of themselves seem to be more resistant to stressing events. The factors of the family atmosphere are: maltreatment, parental loss, attachment and support, discipline and surveillance, carefulness and parents' mental illness. Regarding these factors it is possible to say that abuse can result in a disturbance of the normal development. Whereas a good care quality educational opportunities, appropriate nutrition and support from the community to the families, during the early childhood, propitiate a positive development at a cognitive, social and self-regulation level in both children and adolescents. It is known that resilient boys come from homes with structure and rules. For these children, the role of a healthy and reliable paternal figure serves as a model for identity and for the appropriate emotional expression. Instead, the resilient girls develop in homes that combine the emphasis in the taking of risks as well as the independence, besides they are supported by a caregiver. Finally, the factors in the community are: violence, social networks and neighborhood. It has been recognized that children who live in violent neighborhoods have a high risk of developing internalized and externalized disorders. Nevertheless, the acceptance of their peers and their friendships can attenuate their family adversity, what surely helps them to acquire social abilities; in that same direction, an appropriate social organization can reduce the impact of poverty and violence in the community. It is important to mention that these factors continually interact with each other (and should not be seen in an isolated way) in what we call adaptive systems, those which directly contribute to the satisfactory adjustment or recovery of balance after the exposure to one or more adverse events. When these adaptive systems are available and work properly, the individuals are said to be resilient. We know that in these adaptive systems, mainly in the first stages of life, a disturbance can exist as a consequence of chronic or acute exposure of the individual to adversity. The adaptive systems are as follows: learning, attachment, motivation, response to stress, selfmodulation, family, school, pairs, cultural and social systems. In the study of resilience, it is impossible to solely have a biological or environmental vision. A gene-environment interplay perspective allows a more integrative model of this and other phenomena. There exist at least two types of gene-environment interplay: 1. The gene-environment correlation (rGE) and 2. The gene X environment interaction. Studies in maltreated children have been carried out, where genes implicated in the protection or decrease of risk to psychopathology have been identified. Certain genotypes confer protection for depression, schizophrenia, abuse of substances or maltreatment. To know some of the factors that may contribute to resilience leads us to the following question: will it be possible to intervene in populations at risk? From this perspective, the fact that children suffer damage as a consequence of the insult to their adaptive systems which are not completely developed, makes it possible to prevent the damage, and to repair or to improve these adaptive systems.},

abstract={Introduction: Several studies in animals and humans have clearly demonstrated the effect of ID on development, cognition, behavior and neurophysiology. The effect of ID have been shown: on brain metabolism, neurotransmitter function, and myelination. Changes in brain iron content caused by early ID in animals are not reversible by iron therapy, inspite of correction of anemia and other tissue deficits and result in changes in behavior which continue into adulthood. ID has repercussions in the perinatal period, infancy and childhood. Some effects are irreversible while other defects may be corrected: timing of ID in a child may be critical. Developmental Deficits: Children (6-23 months) with moderate to severe anemia (ID) or chronic anemia (>3 months) had lower mental and psychomotor development scores than the nonanemic, and except for some continued to have lower scores in spite of iron therapy for 3 months although anemia was corrected. The deficits persisted on re-evaluation at 5, 11-14, and at 19 years. Scholastic Achievement: Scholastic achievement is lower and ID children are twice more likely to have problems with mathematics. Ten year follow-up indicated special educational assistance was required for initially anemic children. ID affects WICS items of information, comprehension and verbal performance and full scale IQ. EEG power spectrum had a slower activity suggesting developmental lag compared to iron sufficient children. Treatment with iron improved IQ scores significantly; other studies found differential effects: improvement in cognition and mental scores in older but not in younger children. IQ levels are affected by ID: IQ at 4 years may be predicted by hemoglobin at 5 and 36 months. Neurophysiological Deficits: Abnormal Evoked Response Potentials (ERPs):ABRs and VEPs are seen in ID, which persist in children who were anemic in infancy on retesting at 4 years. Differences have been consistently found in ID infants and in older children. Iron supplementation may significantly reduce latencies of some ERPs. ID affects newborn temperament, ERPs and recognition memory. Iron supplementation in infants (<1,301 g) improved neurocognitive and psychomotor development by 5.3 years (median age). Preventive iron supplementation in well nourished infants also show a positive effect on motor development. The changes are usually subtle, however, with prevalence of anemia of 79.2% in children 6-35 months and 57.9% in pregnant women (NFHS-3, 2005-06), the adverse effects of cognitive, development and behavioral defects should not be underestimated. © 2010 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.},

abstract={Malnutrition, particularly the deficiencies of zinc, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids and the excessive consumption of food additives, is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for childhood externalizing behaviour, including aggression, hyperactivity, delinquency, conduct disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. It is hypothesized that malnutrition can interfere with brain functioning by diminishing neuronal growth and development of the brain, altering neurotransmitter functioning, increasing neurotoxicity, and impairing cognitive functioning. These mechanisms present significant implications for malnutrition during childhood, when the brain is growing most rapidly and therefore vulnerable and sensitive to insults. The food industry, policy makers, and health care professionals will have an important role in changing practice and strengthening education and research to prevent malnutrition for current and future generations. © 2011 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

abstract={I explore the relationship between metabolism and personality by establishing how selection acts on metabolic rate and risk-taking in the context of a trade-off between energy and predation. Using a simple time budget model, I show that a high resting metabolic rate is not necessarily associated with a high daily energy expenditure. The metabolic rate that minimizes the time spent foraging does not maximize the net gain rate while foraging, and it is not always advantageous for animals to have a higher metabolic rate when food availability is high. A model based on minimizing the ratio of mortality rate to net gain rate is used to determine how a willingness to take risks should be correlated with metabolic rate. My results establish that it is not always advantageous for animals to take greater risks when metabolic rate is high. When foraging intensity and metabolic rate coevolve, I show that in a particular case different combinations of foraging intensity and metabolic rate can have equal fitness. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Many animals exhibit behavioural syndromes-consistent individual differences in behaviour across two or more contexts or situations. Here, we present adaptive, state-dependent mathematical models for analysing issues about behavioural syndromes. We find that asset protection (where individuals with more 'assets' tend be more cautious) and starvation avoidance, two state-dependent mechanisms, can explain short-term behavioural consistency, but not long-term stable behavioural types (BTs). These negative-feedback mechanisms tend to produce convergence in state and behaviour over time. In contrast, a positive-feedback mechanism, state-dependent safety (where individuals with higher energy reserves, size, condition or vigour are better at coping with predators), can explain stable differences in personality over the long term. The relative importance of negative-and positive-feedback mechanisms in governing behavioural consistency depends on environmental conditions (predation risk and resource availability). Behavioural syndromes emerge more readily in conditions of intermediate ecological favourability (e.g. medium risk and medium resources, or high risk and resources, or low risk and resources). Under these conditions, individuals with higher initial state maintain a tendency to be bolder than individuals that start with low initial state; i.e. later BT is determined by state during an early 'developmental window'. In contrast, when conditions are highly favourable (low risk, high resources) or highly unfavourable (high risk, low resources), individuals converge to be all relatively bold or all relatively cautious, respectively. In those circumstances, initial differences in BT are not maintained over the long term, and there is no early developmental window where initial state governs later BT. The exact range of ecological conditions favouring behavioural syndromes depends also on the strength of state-dependent safety. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The exoskeleton of arthropods forms an efficient protection against pathogens, but this first line of defence is periodically weakened during ecdysis, increasing the opportunity for surrounding pathogens to invade the body cavity. Since the richness of pathogens in the environment can be spatially and temporally variable, arthropods may have a fitness advantage in moulting in a place and time of low infection risk. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the amphipod crustacean, Gammarus pulex, exhibits temporal adjustment of the moult cycle in response to elevated risks of infection. Interestingly, this phenomenon is variable between two populations and independent of levels of immune defences. These results suggest that plasticity of the moult cycle in response to elevated risks of infection is adaptive and may result from adaptation to local variations in the risk of infection. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={When experiencing resource competition or abrupt environmental change, animals often must transition rapidly from an ancestral diet to a novel, derived diet. Yet, little is known about the proximate mechanisms that mediate such rapid evolutionary transitions. Here, we investigated the role of diet-induced, cryptic genetic variation in facilitating the evolution of novel resource-use traits that are associated with a new feeding strategy-carnivory-in tadpoles of spadefoot toads (genus Sped). We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals, mediates the expression of this variation. Specifically, we compared broad-sense heritabilities of tadpoles fed different diets or treated with exogenous corticosterone, and found that novel diets can expose cryptic genetic variation to selection, and that diet-induced hormones may play a role in revealing this variation. Our results therefore suggest that cryptic genetic variation may have enabled the evolutionary transition to carnivory in Spea tadpoles, and that such variation might generally facilitate rapid evolutionary transitions to novel diets. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Food restriction (FR) has a beneficial effect on aging process and exerts a significant effect on the responses of rodents to standard behavioral tasks. The aim of this study was to assess the cumulative influence of FR on the behavioral and biochemical parameters in Wistar rats. Six-month-old rats were subjected to restrictive feeding (50% of the daily food intake, every-other-day feeding regimen) for one month or for six months until ages of 7 and 12. months, respectively. We examined the habituation of exploratory movement, amphetamine (AMPH)-induced motor activity, as well as changes in serum corticosterone (CORT) and glucose levels. The results obtained from FR animals were compared with ad libitum (AL)-fed age-matched control rats. Habituation of motor activity was only affected by six months of restrictive feeding. The sensitization of the motor response to AMPH that was observed in animals exposed to FR for one month was not observed in animals that were exposed to the same feeding regimen for six months. Serum CORT was increased and serum glucose was decreased in both FR groups. These results clearly show that despite the similarity of the biochemical changes that were induced by one and six months of FR, the nature of the changes in motor activities in these two groups of animals during habituation and after AMPH treatment was different. Our findings indicate that long-term FR has complex behavioral consequences that need to be carefully evaluated with respect to animal age, duration of FR and severity of the diet. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Habituation to nonlethal predation stimuli may provide benefits for animals living in areas with frequent encounters with low-risk predators. On the other hand, individuals can be very consistent in their antipredator responses, with shy individuals showing greater degree of responsiveness than bold individuals. However, the link between habituation or boldness and individual benefits has not been thoroughly investigated. We established whether and how two behavioral components associated with antipredator responses (habituation and boldness, and their interaction) would influence body condition, which is a parameter related to fitness. We conducted an outdoor semi-natural experiment with Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica). Individual boldness was consistent across contexts, but we did not find any effect of boldness or the interaction between boldness and habituation on body condition. However, those individuals that habituated more readily to a frequent predatory stimulus were able to increase their body condition more relative to lizards that habituated less. This finding highlights the importance of individual differences in behavioral plasticity, which could influence traits related to fitness. Habituation can provide benefits for individuals exposed to low-risk predators; however, individuals more prone to habituation could also experience mortality costs by wrongly habituating to a dangerous predator. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Anti-predator behaviour often represents a trade-off between the benefits of reducing predation risk and the drawbacks of limiting access to resources (e. g. food availability, mating and nesting sites). The effectiveness of avoidance behaviour relies on the ability to detect predator cues, which may provide reliable information on predation risk. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we studied the relative importance of visual and chemical cues in the triggering of anti-predator responses in Galaxias maculatus, where Oncorhyncus mykiss was used as the predator. Metabolic cost was also estimated, measured as oxygen consumption. Exposure to different types of predator cue induced diverse behavioural responses in G. maculatus. Detection of the exotic predator, using both visual and chemical stimuli, resulted in reduced G. maculatus swimming activity and changes in respiratory rate. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={This chapter provides an overview of the history of captive red panda diet development by discussing the anatomy and basal metabolic rate of red pandas, feeding ecology, nutritional recommendations for red pandas, and the effect of the diet on nutrition-related problems, and fecal quality. Red pandas, although classified with in Carnivora, exhibit highly herbivorous dietary habits with a specialization on bamboo leaves and shoots. They possess anatomical, metabolic, and physiological adaptations adapted for this feeding strategy, but no gastrointestinal modifications related to herbivory. Thus, although bamboo is rather poorly digested by red pandas, captive diets containing nutrient profiles that more closely mimic native bamboos, including high fiber content, result in improved gastrointestinal and oral health in this species, compared with more historical cereal/grain-based diets supplemented with fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins. The use of moderately digestible, nutritionally complete dry high fibre diets developed through controlled feeding trials, compared to gruels or porridges, contributes to improved fecal quality indices and dental health. Dry diets should be supplemented with 200-400 g bamboo or other natural sources of dietary fibre (when bamboo is not available) to encourage natural feeding behaviors, as well as for nutritional and dietary enrichment. The intake of limited animal proteins and enhanced predatory behaviors in red pandas are often noted more frequently during breeding/reproductive periods. © 2011 Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Female feeding regime exhibited a cascade of effects on reproductive biology and behaviour in the mantid Stagmomantis limbata (Hahn).Well-fed females (High diet) consistently attained greater body mass, thicker abdomens, and higher fecundity than food-limited females (Low diet) in four annual generations. Dorso-ventral abdominal thickness strongly correlated with fecundity.In an experiment in captivity, Low diet females were more likely to cannibalize males than High diet females.High diet females attracted more males than Low diet females in several contexts. In terms of long-range attraction, caged High diet females attracted more males in the field. In terms of short-range attraction, males preferentially mounted and copulated with High diet females in captive paired choice trials. In naturally-occurring pairs in the field, a preference for females with thick abdomens was evident. These results point to two possible explanations: male choice for well-fed females and state-dependent female pheromone emission.Two years of field data indicate considerable variation in female feeding success, as measured by abdominal thickness. Average feeding success in nature appears to be relatively high, when comparing the rate of abdominal expansion in the field to captive females maintained on High diets.In the field, nearly all mounts and copulations occurred in September in both years, when female feeding success is expected to be high. If mating activity occurs during a window of high female feeding success, so as to reduce the risk of cannibalism for males, then the female feeding regime may be implicated in the phenology of mating activity in cannibalistic species. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity can improve fitness in unstable environments and can be expressed in many traits, such as life history attributes, growth and behavioural features. Microhabitat choice can have important consequences for development and survival of aquatic organisms and is expected to vary in response to stimuli, such as predation risk, food availability and temperature. At seasonal sites, microhabitat availability and associated benefits may change from season to season, which might lead to altered patterns of microhabitat use by tadpoles. We investigated this hypothesis in 17 streams from two localities in south-eastern Brazil. We tested whether water level drops significantly during the dry season, whether lower water level results in altered microhabitat availability and whether predation risk changes between seasons, based on predator density. We then tested whether tadpoles change their pattern of microhabitat use, their spatial niche breadth (given by diversity of used microhabitats) and spatial niche overlap (in the case of co-occurring species). We were able to include in our analyses tadpoles of four species of Hylidae, that occurred throughout both seasons. Stream depth decreased in the dry season, but microhabitat availability remained relatively stable in many streams, and predator density did not change significantly. Tadpoles of three out of the four species studied were more abundant during the dry season, which may be an adaptation to adjust time of metamorphosis to the rainy season. Tadpoles changed their patterns of microhabitat use between seasons, although the potential causing factors investigated did not seem to be responsible. Tadpole plasticity in microhabitat use may indicate the existence of selective pressures that vary through time and space and are still not well understood. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have garnered significant attention as an important grouping of developmental brain disorders. Recent genomic studies have revealed that inherited or de novo copy number variations (CNVs) are significantly involved in the pathophysiology of ASDs. In a previous report from our laboratory, we generated mice with CNVs as a model of ASDs, with a duplicated mouse chromosome 7C that is orthologous to human chromosome 15q11-13. Behavioral analyses revealed paternally duplicated (patDp/+) mice displayed abnormal behaviors resembling the symptoms of ASDs. In the present study, we extended these findings by performing various behavioral tests with C57BL/6J patDp/+ mice, and comprehensively measuring brain monoamine levels with ex vivo high performance liquid chromatography. Compared with wild-type controls, patDp/+ mice exhibited decreased locomotor and exploratory activities in the open field test, Y-maze test, and fear-conditioning test. Furthermore, their decreased activity levels overcame increased appetite induced by 24 hours of food deprivation in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Serotonin levels in several brain regions of adult patDp/ + mice were lower than those of wild-type control, with no concurrent changes in brain levels of dopamine or norepinephrine. Moreover, analysis of monoamines in postnatal developmental stages demonstrated reduced brain levels of serotonin in young patDp/+ mice. These findings suggest that a disrupted brain serotonergic system, especially during postnatal development, may generate the phenotypes of patDp/+ mice. © 2010 Tamada et al.},

We hypothesized that, under these conditions, individuals of a social species such as European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, would be more responsive to social cues indicating food presence than individuals belonging to populations already established in a well-known habitat. To test this hypothesis, we displayed starling decoys with various age, group size and interindividual distance characteristics in feeding postures to evaluate their attractiveness to starlings from towns and colonization fronts and noted whether attracted individuals joined particular decoy groups. Our results supported our hypothesis that sensitivity to social cues varied according to the population's history, and we suggest that these cues enhance the success of starlings in occupying new habitats. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In our model of sucrose bingeing, behavioral components of addiction are demonstrated and related to neurochemical changes that also occur with addictive drugs. Evidence supports the hypothesis that rats can become dependent and " addicted" to sucrose. Results obtained when animals binge on other palatable foods, including a fat-rich food, are described and suggest that increased body weight can occur. However, the characterization of an addiction-like behavioral profile in animals with binge access to fat requires further exploration in order to dissociate the effect of increased body weight from the diet or schedule of feeding. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background Captive cynomolgus macaques are prone to obesity, increasing their risk for developing hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Social rank may be a contributing risk factor predisposing macaques to adverse health events.Methods Using retrospective health records from 259 animals, a matched case-control study was conducted to assess risk factors for developing hyperglycemia in group-housed, adult females aged 10 or older. Univariable exact and conditional logistic regression models were used to analyze the data.Result The odds of developing hyperglycemia were significantly greater in animals with more frequent counts of injury. Similarly, subordinate animals had higher odds of developing hyperglycemia than affiliates.Conclusions Subordinate social status may increase the risk of hyperglycemia in mature female cynomolgus macaques. Opportunities for subordinates to alter feeding strategies are reduced in captivity. This may be associated with increased social stress around feeding, and for animals housed long-term could predispose them to obesity and hyperglycemia. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

Equids used to transport people by cart, to carry goods by pack, or to work in bricks kilns had more problems than other equids. Rural equids had more problems than urban ones, but urban equids had more lesions, and were more aggressive towards observers. Equids were significantly thinner when climates were warmer.

Secondary analyses were conducted on the individual health behaviors subsumed in the broader index. Findings revealed that negative religious coping was significantly associated with increased cumulative health risk. Positive religious coping was predictive of decreased cumulative health risk among Latina caregivers but not among Caucasians. Negative religious coping was significantly associated with both an increased likelihood for weight gain and increased dietary restriction.

abstract={A key assumption in stock assessment and stock forecasts often is that spawning-stock biomass (SSB) and egg production are proportional and that the reproductive potential is independent of stock structure (age composition and sex ratio). Based on a 60-year time-series of total egg production (TEP) of North Sea plaice, we demonstrate that this assumption could result in a biased perception of the temporal trend in reproductive potential. The time-series incorporates: (i) annual observations on maturity, growth, and condition, (ii) a predictive model for interannual variations in fecundity caused by variations in body condition and by the probability of being a recruit spawner, and (iii) a cohort analysis of sex-specific landings-at-age since 1948. Following an increase in fishing mortality rate, TEP declined by a factor of 7-8 from a peak in the 1970s to a minimum in 1999-2000. Concurrent with this decline, the contribution of recruit spawners and the size difference between spawning males and females decreased. The implications of phenotypic plasticity and fisheries-induced evolutionary changes in growth and maturation for the recovery potential of the plaice stock are discussed. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract={Extensive livestock systems are characterised by limited input. In such systems animal food requirements are mainly based on grazing. Vegetation varies in terms of space and time, and is heterogeneous and sensitive to climatic changes. The low control by the breeders on the immediate environment implies that the management of extensive systems in such a context mainly depends on the adaptive ability of the animals. They have to be able to fulfill their food requirements by developing specific behaviours such as land exploration and selective intake. They also have to cope with low feed intake periods of various intensities and duration. In this paper we demonstrate that herbivores adjust their behaviour and physiological responses to cope with their environment and face constraints. Such adjustments highlight the differences between breeds in their ability to survive, produce and maintain their reproduction in a harsh unstable environment.},

abstract={Species coexistence within ecosystems and the stability of patterns of temporal changes in population sizes are central topics in ecological theory. In the last decade, adaptive behaviour has been proposed as a mechanism of population stabilization. In particular, widely distributed adaptive trophic behaviour (ATB), the fitness-enhancing changes in individuals' feeding-related traits due to variation in their trophic environment, may play a key role in modulating the dynamics of feeding relationships within natural communities. In this article, we review and synthesize models and results from theoretical research dealing with the consequences of ATB on the structure and dynamics of complex food webs. We discuss current approaches, point out limitations, and consider questions ripe for future research. In spite of some differences in the modelling and analytic approaches, there are points of convergence: (1) ATB promotes the complex structure of ecological networks, (2) ATB increases the stability of their dynamics, (3) ATB reverses May's negative complexity-stability relationship, and (4) ATB provides resilience and resistance of networks against perturbations. Current knowledge supports ATB as an essential ingredient for models of community dynamics, and future research that incorporates ATB will be well positioned to address questions important for basic ecological research and its applications. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Across a variety of species, the amygdala appears to play a key role in the detection and avoidance of potential dangers (e.g., unfamiliar social partners, novel objects or contexts, potential predators, etc.). For many species, seeking out appropriate food sources and avoiding novel, distasteful or potentially tainted food is also a daily concern. Amygdala damage in nonhuman primates has been linked to increased willingness to select unfamiliar or unpalatable foods, as well as inedible items that intact animals typically reject. However, such findings have not always been consistent and have typically been observed in relatively restrictive, laboratory-based testing contexts. We evaluated the food choices of six adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with bilateral, neurotoxic amygdala lesions and six age- and experienced-matched unoperated control animals. Each animal was able to forage freely in a large enclosure stocked with five preferred and five nonpreferred foods that changed locations each day. While both groups quickly selected palatable foods, monkeys with amygdala lesions consistently selected unpalatable foods that the unoperated control animals generally avoided. Even after repeated presentations of the unpalatable foods, the amygdala-lesioned monkeys failed to change their initial pattern of diminished avoidance. These results are consistent with a general role for the amygdala in danger detection and prevention of harm in the presence of novel or noxious stimuli, regardless of whether such stimuli are conspecifics, predators, objects or foods. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Plant cell walls are a heterogeneous mixture of polysaccharides and proteins that require a range of different enzymes to degrade them. Plant cell walls are also the primary source of cellulose, the most abundant and useful biopolymer on the planet. Plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) are therefore important in a wide range of biotechnological processes from the production of biofuels and food to waste processing. However, despite the fact that the last common ancestor of all deuterostomes was inferred to be able to digest, or even synthesize, cellulose using endogenous genes, all model insects whose complete genomes have been sequenced lack genes encoding such enzymes. To establish if the apparent "disappearance" of PCWDEs from insects is simply a sampling problem, we used 454 mediated pyrosequencing to scan the gut transcriptomes of beetles that feed on a variety of plant derived diets. By sequencing the transcriptome of five beetles, and surveying publicly available ESTs, we describe 167 new beetle PCWDEs belonging to eight different enzyme families. This survey proves that these enzymes are not only present in non-model insects but that the multigene families that encode them are apparently undergoing complex birth-death dynamics. This reinforces the observation that insects themselves, and not just their microbial symbionts, are a rich source of PCWDEs. Further it emphasises that the apparent absence of genes encoding PCWDEs from model organisms is indeed simply a sampling artefact. Given the huge diversity of beetles alive today, and the diversity of their lifestyles and diets, we predict that beetle guts will emerge as an important new source of enzymes for use in biotechnology. © 2010 Pauchet et al.},

abstract={Although explanatory and predictive powers are 2 closely interconnected aspects of conceptual and mathematical models of complex systems, the two are not equivalent. The 2 aspects are discussed here for the microbial part of photic zone food webs of the marine pelagic. We focus on the specific question of how limiting nutrients are transferred from the dissolved form, through the microbial food web, to mesozooplankton. For this purpose, 5 different nutrient addition experiments are reviewed and compared to a 'simplest possible' conceptual food web model. The experiments range in scale from artificial food webs constructed in laboratory chemostats, via mesocosm experiments, to a Lagrangian open-ocean addition experiment and cover time scales from days to weeks. We conclude that main system responses in all cases can be explained within the framework of the simple model, and that each experiment therefore also adds credibility to the basic concepts of this model. However, different system attributes profoundly affect the pathway and speed of nutrient transfer in each experiment. A re-occurring theme seems to be how the interactions between flexible stoichiometry and predatory processes modify experimental outcomes. Understanding the flexibility in the behavior of the system has thus increased with each experiment, but the requirement for new ad hoc assumptions to be added to the basic model structure in each case makes reliable predictions of the experimental outcome appear only possible with further model elaboration. © Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract={Trade-offs between behavioural traits promoting high life-history productivity and mortality may fuel the evolution of animal personalities. We propose that parasites, including pathogens, impose fitness costs comparable to those from predators, and influence the adaptiveness of personality traits associated with productivity (PAPs). Whether personality traits are adaptive or not may also depend on individual immunological capacity. We illustrate this using a conceptual example in which the optimal level of PAPs depends on predation, parasitism and host compensation (resistance and tolerance) of parasitism's negative effects. We assert that inherent differences in host immune function can produce positive feedback loops between resource intake and compensation of parasitism's costs, thereby providing variation underlying the evolution of stable personalities. Our approach acknowledges the condition dependence of immune function and co-evolutionary dynamics between hosts and parasites. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Predatory mites are important biological control agents of herbivorous spider mites. Two predatory mite species were demonstrated to produce sex pheromones as early as 1970s. Many studies revealed that predatory mites could use plant volatiles to locate their herbivorous prey. Plant volatiles affect prey-searching and prey-selection behavior of predatory mites in several ways: (1) Predatory mites disperse on wind currents and probably exert little control on where they land. Thus, the chances of landing in a spider-mite colony are small. However, after landing, plant volatiles are used in making foraging decisions such as whether to stay or to take off, and where or how long to stay; (2) Once predatory mites are in a prey patch (a group of leaves infested by prey), their behavior is affected by volatile and nonvolatile chemicals. As a result the predators stay in the patch as long as prey-related semiochemicals are present; (3) Predatory mites distinguish between plant volatiles related to different prey species. Thus, distant information about prey availability initiates prey selection decisions similar to those made in the prey patch. The plant volatiles are released from undamaged, artificial damaged, prey infested, or non-prey infested plants. The attractiveness of predatory mites to volatiles from undamaged or artificially damaged plants is depending on their food specialization, which means the less phytophagous species they are feeding the less plant volatiles they are responding. Different plant species show qualitative and quantitative differences in the production of spider mite-induced volatiles, which differ in attractiveness to predatory mites. Compared with the volatile from undamaged and artificial damaged plants, the volatiles from prey-infested plants can provide more reliable information on the existence of the prey. Even cultivars of the same species may differ in production of volatiles and attractiveness, and differences in attractiveness to predatory mites have also been found when different herbivores damage the same plant cultivar. Some predatory mites are even attracted by the volatiles related to nonprey herbivores, which indicates that it is not necessary to use every level of semiochemcials. Several synthetic plant volatile compounds can attract predatory mites, but the attraction to each individual compound is lower compared to the full plant volatile blend. Several factors, such as rearing condition, starvation level, experience, and learning influence the response of predatory mites to plant volatiles. The host plant species on which predatory mites consume their prey may affect olfactory responses. Different rearing conditions on the same host plant species are important factors in determining olfactory response of the predatory mites. Nutrient composition of the diet can also cause the change in their olfactory response. The chemical composition of herbivore-induced plant volatiles may vary with plant and herbivore species and thus the predatory mites are confronted with variable information about the presence of their prey. To cope with this bewildering variety of information, predatory mites may adjust their behavioral response to any relevant odor associated with prey by learning and experience. The role of sex pheromones and plant volatiles on predatory mites is thoroughly discussed in this paper, as well as current research problems and future perspectives.},

abstract={Animals search for foods and decide their behaviors according to previous experience. Caenorhabditis elegans detects chemicals with a limited number of sensory neurons, allowing us to dissect roles of each neuron for innate and learned behaviors. C. elegans is attracted to salt after exposure to the salt (NaCl) with food. In contrast, it learns to avoid the salt after exposure to the salt without food. In salt-attraction behavior, it is known that the ASE taste sensory neurons (ASEL and ASER) play a major role. However, little is known about mechanisms for learned salt avoidance. Here, through dissecting contributions of ASE neurons for salt chemotaxis, we show that both ASEL and ASER generate salt chemotaxis plasticity. In ASER, we have previously shown that the insulin/PI 3-kinase signaling acts for starvation-induced salt chemotaxis plasticity. This study shows that the PI 3-kinase signaling promotes aversive drive of ASER but not of ASEL. Furthermore, the Gq signaling pathway composed of Gqα EGL-30, diacylglycerol, and nPKC (novel protein kinase C) TTX-4 promotes attractive drive of ASER but not of ASEL. A putative salt receptor GCY-22 guanylyl cyclase is required in ASER for both salt attraction and avoidance. Our results suggest that ASEL and ASER use distinct molecular mechanisms to regulate salt chemotaxis plasticity. Copyright © 2010 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract={When the first of the British-themed and -produced historical House series, 1900 House, aired in the United States on PBS in June 2000, the network described the project as "classy voyeurism" and the place where "the sci-fidrama of time travel meets true-life drama."1 The success of 1900 House has since led to other Anglo-American productions, including 1940s House (2000), Frontier House (2001), Manor House (2002), Colonial House (2003), Texas Ranch House (2006), and even PBS's own version of reality dating (albeit in corsets and tights), Regency House Party (2004). Determined to distinguish the House series from other reality TV programs aired on commercial networks, PBS's producer Beth Hoppe insists that this is the only one "with something to offer. We're exploring history. No one else is doing that."2 It is true that the producers consult historians and provide rule books and period-appropriate clothing, but it is not always history that drives the series' ensuing drama. As the above quote suggests, participants and viewers of these shows prefer a Fantasy Island version of the past: family togetherness, chandelier-lit drawing rooms, and heroic endeavors. As the Texas ranchers or Edwardian aristocrats try to live through their particular moment in the past, they perform their assigned roles, and the exploration of history, the so-called goal of the series, becomes a game (de Groot 403). Indeed, the professional historian is rarely visible in the series. When a military historian is invited to the final dinner of Regency House Party to lecture on the Battle of Waterloo, his words are drowned out by music; he is obviously too dull for viewers who prefer to see the developing romances among the guests. The social historian Tristram Hunt takes issue with reality TV programming that uses history for purposes of "edutainment" and self-discovery. In his essay "Reality, Identity and Empathy: The Changing Face of Social History Television," Hunt observes that the recent media craze for history suggests a cultural and psychological search for "nourishment" by a secular society. Though more history is certainly being consumed, he adds, "it is far from clear how much is nurturing a deep and abiding sense of the past" (843). Indeed, historical accuracy takes a backseat to the time traveler's need to understand the self, as the programs' personality clashes and emotional breakdowns move front and center. The past, meanwhile, is reconstructed as a decorative backdrop and the "life lessons" gleaned from the video confessionals all tell a similar tale. The teenaged Tracy Clune of Frontier House, for example, predicts that when she returns to her twenty-first-century life, she will be less materialistic, and hence a "better" person: "I'm not the same person, and I'm happy about that" (www.pbs.org/wnet/frontierhouse/families/profile-tracy.html). As the participants in these experiments typically conclude, the point of all their "suffering" (e.g., doing without shampoo or processed foods) is to understand and question their current lives and values, while realizing that the past and present are not so different after all. The penniless singer in Regency House Party, Mr. Carrington, explains how the experience "opened my eyes to a world I knew little about, which changes your perspective on the modern world we live in." Not surprisingly, historians criticize such a superficial approach to learning history, in which issues of class, race, and gender inequality, which clearly mark the past as different and distinct, are glossed over. But even Hunt acknowledges that the same analytical rigor that is demanded of the published historical text does not always make for a "lucrative media commodity" (843). Furthermore, to call reality history TV "bogus history" or "trash" misses the point of these programs and of the volunteer's and viewer's personal relationship to history (Nelson 143). In her study of the mythology of the American West, Liza Nicholas observes that "what people believe to be true about their pasts is usually more important in determining their behavior and responses than truth itself" (xvii). It is through these myths, she adds, that we make sense of ourselves and explore our identity. Even Hoppe admits that her childhood memories of the Little House books and TV series based on them prompted her desire to revisit the pioneering experience in Frontier House and to see if twenty-first-century citizens could measure up to the Ingalls family. As soon as the viewers meet the volunteers on the House programs, it becomes clear that the "living history" experience is dependent less on the advice of historical consultants and more on fictional depictions (and collective memories of such depictions) of the various pasts that the House programs aim to faithfully re-create. Since the "total" experience cannot possibly be re-created (no one dies from TB, dropped bombs, or malnutrition in these shows), we are ultimately left with more fiction than fact, and the myths that Hoppe says the series aim to "bust" often remain intact. Watching an episode of Regency House Party or Texas Ranch House cannot help calling to mind certain familiar novels, films, and earlier TV programs that tried to capture these same eras. And the performances of those who take part in these time-traveling experiments are shaped (both unconsciously and at times deliberately) by such fictions, such as the housewife coping with rations in 1940s House who imagines herself in "my Mrs. Miniver mode," Manor House's tutor and his Jane Eyre fantasy, and the girls on the frontier who clearly want to emulate the gumption of the Ingalls daughters. Even as the volunteers gain a general familiarity with a particular era and its hardships, they remain reluctant to let go of certain notions about the past. In the words of Regency House Party's Captain Glover, what they really want is "a romantic experience as well as a historical one". Copyright © 2010 by The University Press of Kentucky.

abstract={In this article the figure of a brilliant surgeon Guillaume Dupuytren (1777-1835) is presented, taking into consideration his influence on surgery development. Guillaume Dupuytren was a man of genius, perfect specialist, charismatic lecturer. On the other hand, he was eccentric, despotic, difficult in cooperation, persecuted by obsession of power and applause "brigand of Hotel Dieu". His contribution to progress of operative treatment is invaluable: to start with hygienic rules and nutrition introduced to surgical ward through methods of classification and treatment of burns to end with many pioneer solutions in general and orthopedic surgery. Guillaume Dupuytren was an outstanding and colorful personality who rose from poverty and obscurity to wealth and international fame as a leading surgeon of Paris. Guillaume Dupuytren was born in 1777 in Pierre-Buffiere, a small village in France. Dupuytren's education in Paris was filled with lots of sacrifices, because of his poverty at this time. He started his adventure in science world when he was 17 and became supervising prosector in medical school. When he started working in Hotel Dieu hospital, his career gathered speed, so to say, and he became a chef of surgery 12 years later. From that point he reigned supreme at Hotel Dieu for almost 30 years. He induced primary rules to his ward: hygienic and dietetic. For saving Louis's XVIII nephew's life the king gave him the baron title. Dupuytren evolved in many different branches of medicine, from the treatment of cholera and vaginitis, ingrown toe nail to the management of war wounds. In Paris not only his surgical achievements were known, but also his maelstroms in personal life: he called off his wedding the night before it should have taken place. His disputes with other famous surgeons became a legend, eg.: battle of slanders with Lisfranc. Dupuytren's personalisty was so interesting that it became an inspiration for Balzac to describe it in his novel 'The Atheist's Mass'. The famous Parisian surgeon was depicted as a character called Desplein. In spite of being cold and ruthless to his co-workers and rivals, he was known for his charity to the poor. He run free clinic for all the destitude. The twilight of titan's work came when in 1833, while lecturing, he had a stroke. After the stroke he was forced to take a leave of absence (in 25 years he missed hardly a day). Dupuytren died on 8th February, 1835.},

abstract={Background. A number of risk factors are associated with the development of childhood obesity which can be identified during infancy. These include infant feeding practices, parental response to infant temperament and parental perception of infant growth and appetite. Parental beliefs and understanding are crucial determinants of infant feeding behaviour; therefore any intervention would need to take account of their views. This study aimed to explore UK parents' beliefs concerning their infant's size, growth and feeding behaviour and parental receptiveness to early intervention aimed at reducing the risk of childhood obesity. Method. Six focus groups were undertaken in a range of different demographic localities, with parents of infants less than one year of age. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis applied using an interpretative, inductive approach. Results. 38 parents (n = 36 female, n = 2 male), age range 19-45 years (mean 30.1 years, SD 6.28) participated in the focus groups. 12/38 were overweight (BMI 25-29.99) and 8/38 obese (BMI >30). Five main themes were identified. These were a) parental concern about breast milk, infant contentment and growth; b) the belief that the main cause of infant distress is hunger is widespread and drives inappropriate feeding; c) rationalisation for infants' larger size; d) parental uncertainty about identifying and managing infants at risk of obesity and e) intentions and behaviour in relation to a healthy lifestyle. Conclusions. There are a number of barriers to early intervention with parents of infants at risk of developing obesity. Parents are receptive to prevention prior to weaning and need better support with best practice in infant feeding. In particular, this should focus on helping them understand the physiology of breast feeding, how to differentiate between infant distress caused by hunger and other causes and the timing of weaning. Some parents also need guidance about how to recognize and prepare healthy foods and facilitate physical activity for their infants. © 2010 Redsell et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Anticipation of resource availability is a vital skill yet it is poorly understood in terms of neuronal circuitry. Rodents display robust anticipatory activity in the several hours preceding timed daily access to food when access is limited to a short temporal duration. We tested whether this anticipatory behavior could be generalized to timed daily social interaction by examining if singly housed male mice could anticipate either a daily novel female or a familiar female. We observed that anticipatory activity was moderate under both conditions, although both a novel female partner and sexual experience are moderate contributing factors to increasing anticipatory activity. In contrast, restricted access to running wheels did not produce any anticipatory activity, suggesting that an increase in activity during the scheduled access time was not sufficient to induce anticipation. To tease apart social versus sexual interaction, we tested the effect of exposing singly housed female mice to a familiar companion female mouse daily. The female mice did not show anticipatory activity for restricted female access, despite a large amount of social interaction, suggesting that daily timed social interaction between mice of the same gender is insufficient to induce anticipatory activity. Our study demonstrates that male mice will show anticipatory activity, albeit inconsistently, for a daily timed sexual encounter. © 2010 Hsu, et al.},

abstract={The European eelpout follows an aplacental viviparous reproductive strategy, in which gestation lasts 4-5. months. During the last months of development yolk reserves are depleted, and embryos depend on an external source of nutrients. Here we provide evidence for novel specialized physiological, morphological and behavioural adaptations, which we propose as the responsible mechanisms for the exchange of nutrients and gases between the maternal organism and her embryos. Ovarian follicles contain an internal glomerulus-like structure within the distal tip of each follicle. Ultrastructural examination indicated a capacity for steroid synthesis and secretion. Gel electrophoresis demonstrated a protein size distribution in the follicular fluid different from that of the maternal serum, and that ovarian fluid is devoid of protein. From vascular casts and histological sections the follicle was reconstructed. The glomerulus has a central canal that is exteriorized at the tip of the follicle, allowing passage of follicular fluid. Oxygen measurements across the ovary of near-term females showed a strongly hypoxic ovary lumen, yet ovarian fluid adjacent to follicles was oxygen saturated. As another novel observation, embryos were seen engaged in suckling on follicles. We hypothesize that embryos use the follicles on the ovarian wall as placental analogues and that they use their mobile jaw apparatus to attach themselves and apply suction. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={β-Cyclocitral is often present in eutrophic waters and is a well known source of airborne and drinking water malodor, but its production and functional ecology are unresolved. This volatile organic compound (VOC) is derived from the catalytic breakdown of β-carotene, and evidence indicates that it is produced by the activation of a specific carotene oxygenase by all species of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis. Previous work has shown that β-cyclocitral affects grazer behavior, but the nature of this interaction and its influence on predator-prey dynamics was unresolved. The present study combined analytical and behavioral studies to evaluate this interaction by using Microcystis NRC-1 and Daphnia magna. Results showed that β-cyclocitral was undetectable in live Microcystis cells, or present only at extremely low concentrations (2.6 amol /cell). In contrast, cell rupture activated a rapid carotene oxygenase reaction, which produced high amounts (77 ± 5.5 amol β-cyclocitral/cell), corresponding to a calculated maximum intracellular concentration of 2.2mM. The behavioral response of Daphnia magna to β-cyclocitral was evaluated in a bbe© Daphnia toximeter, where β-cyclocitral treatments induced a marked increase in swimming velocity. Acclimation took place within a few minutes, when Daphnia returned to normal swimming velocity while still exposed to β-cyclocitral. The minimum VOC concentration (odor threshold) that elicited a significant grazer response was 750 nM β-cyclocitral, some 2,900 times lower than the per capita yield of a growing Microcystis cell after activation. Under natural conditions, initial grazer-related or other mode of cell rupture would lead to the development of a robust β-cyclocitral microzone around Microcystis colonies, thus acting as both a powerful repellent and signal of poor quality food to grazers. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Epigenetic processes, primarily DNA methylation and covalent modifications of histones, regulate the transcriptional activity of genes in a manner that can be modified by environmental cues. This allows variation in the expression of the transcriptome without changes in the genome. Constraint in the early life environment, such as poor early nutrition, is associated with increased risk of non-communicable diseases, including cardio-metabolic disease and cancer in later life. Such induced phenotypic change involves environmental signals acting through developmental plasticity. Recent studies in humans and in animal models show that epigenetic processes, in particular DNA methylation, have a central role in the induction and stability of novel phenotypes and in increased disease risk. Identification of such processes suggests the potential for developing biomarkers of disease risk and for interventions to prevent or reverse the adverse effects of a poor early life environment. At present, knowledge in this area is limited to proof-of-principle studies in animal models and some initial studies in humans. Before such findings can be translated into reliable biomarkers and safe, effective interventions, several fundamental questions need to be answered. In order to achieve this, new technologies will be needed to support large cohort studies. Despite the early stage of knowledge in this field and the intellectual, technological and financial challenges, epigenetic research has substantial potential for public health benefits.© 2010 BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Blue mussels Mytilus edulis (n = 14) were studied in the laboratory using Hall sensor systems to record their gaping behaviour when exposed to varying food rations and levels of predation risk. Mussel response to increasing daily algal ration was to increase mean gape angle per day and was associated with copious pseudofaeces production at excessive initial algal concentrations, e.g. 250 cells/μl. Mean gape angle decreased (backward S-shaped curve) when fed a fixed algal ration per day where simulated predation risk (introduced fresh mussel homogenate) increased in the water, presumably as an anti-predation strategy. However, this behaviour is presumed to lower feeding rates. There was a general positive relationship between both gape angle and the extent of valve movement (abduction/adduction) per event and valve movement speed. However, the fastest valve adduction events, which resulted in valve closure, were recorded independent of gape angle and only when mussels were first exposed to high perceived predation risk. We interpret this as an appropriate response, with high energetic cost, as a first line of defence from predators such as starfish and crabs. Overall, mussel response to predation appears graded and complex, indicating a trade-off between maximizing feeding/pseudofaeces production and minimizing predation risk. © 2010 The Author.

abstract={Animals often alter their behaviour, morphology and physiology in the presence of predators. These induced defences can be fine-tuned by a variety of environmental factors such as predator species, acute predation risk or food availability. It has, however, remained unclear what cues influence the extent and quality of induced defences and how the information content of these cues interact to determine the development of antipredator defences. We performed an experiment to study the significance of direct chemical cues, originating from the predators themselves, and indirect cues, released by attacked or consumed prey, for phenotypic responses in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We reared tadpoles in the presence of caged predators (Triturus vulgaris, Aeshna cyanea) fed either one or three tadpoles every other day outside the tadpole-rearing tanks. Fifteen hours after food provisioning, predators were put back into the tanks containing focal tadpoles either after washing (direct + digestion-released cues) or with the water containing remnants of the prey (direct + all types of indirect cues). Our results suggest that direct cues together with digestion-released cues can be sufficient to induce strong antipredator responses. Induced defences depended on both direct cues, affecting predator-specific responses, and the quantity of indirect cues, resulting in graded responses to differences in predation threat. Moreover, direct and indirect cues interacted in behaviour, resulting in predator-specific graded responses. We also observed a decrease in the extent of predator-induced responses in large tadpoles as compared to small ones. Our results, thus, suggest that prey integrate multiple cues about predators to optimize induced defences and that this process changes during ontogeny. © 2010 The Authors.},

abstract={Importance of the field: Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depressive disorder and suicide. The key and rate limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis is tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). Areas covered in this review: The association between TPH2 and affective disorders as well as future vistas of its potential clinical targeting: i) TPH2 in the regulation of 5-HT-dependent behavior, ii) TPH2 gene polymorphism and human behavior, iii) TPH2 and sensitivity to antidepressants and iv) effect of dietary tryptophan manipulation on affective behavior are described. What the reader will gain: The main conclusions of the review are: i) there is an association between TPH2 and genetically defined behavioral variations, ii) the haplotypes, including some human TPH2 gene SNPs, can predict the risk of affective disorders and the sensitivity to antidepressant therapeutics, iii) mutations decreasing TPH2 activity produce negative effects on behavior and, possibly, on survival, iv) the effect of dietary tryptophan manipulations on human mood and behavior is modest compared with that of inhibitors of 5-HT transporter and monoamine oxidase. Take home message: More comprehensive study of TPH2 genetics is needed to increase the clinical value of the enzyme as a predictor of affective disorder risk and efficacy of antidepressant drugs. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract={Environmental conditions promote weight gain in children and adults, with early nutritional states and the availability of energy condensed/high-fat palatable diets appearing to facilitate the development of obesity. Little is known about the extent to which prenatal and postnatal dietary manipulations alter the response of the adult offspring to high-fat, highly palatable diets. Here we exposed rat dams to highly palatable diet (supplemental diet, SD), rich in fat and sugars, during pregnancy and lactation, and assessed the potential interactions with the effects of a similar diet offered post-weaning on a range of physiological and behavioral parameters in the adult male offspring. Post-weaning exposure to SD increased body weight, body fat, and plasma leptin levels, as well as the plasma glucose response to glucose challenge, compared to chow-fed rats. Combining perinatal SD with post-weaning exposure (SD/SD group) elevated fasting plasma glucose levels, and induced leptin resistance in the adult rats. The same treatment also resulted in sensitized locomotor response to an acute injection of amphetamine. The glucocorticoid response to stress was not affected by the dietary treatments. We conclude that exposure of mother and young to a highly palatable diet with high-fat and high sugar content during the critical perinatal period, increases the risk of developing an obesity-like condition in rats exposed to the same palatable diet post-weaning, and this effect may be accompanied by adaptations in the reward-related mesostriatal dopaminergic system. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Primates show activity patterns ranging from nocturnality to diurnality, with a few species showing activity both during day and night. Among anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans), nocturnality is only present in the Central and South American owl monkey genus Aotus. Unlike other tropical Aotus species, the Azara's owl monkeys (A. azarai) of the subtropics have switched their activity pattern from strict nocturnality to one that also includes regular diurnal activity. Harsher climate, food availability, and the lack of predators or diurnal competitors, have all been proposed as factors favoring evolutionary switches in primate activity patterns. However, the observational nature of most field studies has limited an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this switch in activity patterns. The goal of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that masking, namely the stimulatory and/or inhibitory/disinhibitory effects of environmental factors on synchronized circadian locomotor activity, is a key determinant of the unusual activity pattern of Azara's owl monkeys. We use continuous long-term (6-18 months) 5-min-binned activity records obtained with actimeter collars fitted to wild owl monkeys (n= 10 individuals) to show that this different pattern results from strong masking of activity by the inhibiting and enhancing effects of ambient luminance and temperature. Conclusive evidence for the direct masking effect of light is provided by data showing that locomotor activity was almost completely inhibited when moonlight was shadowed during three lunar eclipses. Temperature also negatively masked locomotor activity, and this masking was manifested even under optimal light conditions. Our results highlight the importance of the masking of circadian rhythmicity as a determinant of nocturnality in wild owl monkeys and suggest that the stimulatory effects of dim light in nocturnal primates may have been selected as an adaptive response to moonlight. Furthermore, our data indicate that changes in sensitivity to specific environmental stimuli may have been an essential key for evolutionary switches between diurnal and nocturnal habits in primates. © 2010 Fernández-Duque et al.},

abstract={In nestlings, glucocorticoid (GC) secretion has short-term and long-term f itness consequences. For example, short-time elevations trigger begging activity, whereas chronically elevated GC levels impair body condition, growth and cognitive abilities. Despite a growing body of literature on personality traits, the effects of selection for fast and slow exploration on GC secretion have received little attention. We compared baseline and stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity of hand-reared great tit nestlings of lines selected for fast and slow exploration. Nestling droppings were collected under three conditions: control, test (following handling stress, day 14 after hatching) and the following day. The concentrations of excreted immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CM) were determined via an enzyme immunoassay. We also observed nestlings' begging behaviour. CM differed significantly between the lines. Nestlings of the fast line excreted lower CM than slow-line birds. In response to handling stress, nestlings excreted significantly higher concentrations of CM than during the control and on the day after handling. Sex and begging activity were not related to CM levels. Under the control condition, but not after handling, males begged significantly more often than females. In both lines, adults excreted significantly less CM compared to nestlings. Both nestlings and adults of the slow line produced higher baseline CM values than fast-line birds. Fast-line nestlings excreted lower baseline CM than nestlings of a wild population not selected for fast or slow exploration. Slow-line nestlings did not. Our results show that selection on the basis of exploratory behaviour affected HPA axis reactivity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={1. Based on mathematical models, antipredator defence mechanisms are commonly believed to have stabilizing effects on communities. However, empirical data are still lacking.2. We tested stabilizing effects of an inducible vertical migration defence in two Daphnia pulex clones in a 5-week field enclosure experiment. A defended (migrated down into darker water layers in the presence of fish chemicals in both laboratory and field experiments) and non-defended (no ability to react to fish chemicals) clone were directly exposed to fish predators and compared to control enclosures (no fish).3. In the absence of planktivorous fish, both defended and non-defended clones exhibited boom-and-bust dynamics, probably owing to over-exploitation of the food source. Predation almost led to extinction of the non-defended Daphnia clone during the experiment and the fish, deprived of food, lost weight. However, the population density of the defended clone was stable and it did not over-exploit the algal food source, while there was a continuous supply of food to the fish, which consequently gained weight.4. We conclude that both consumptive and non-consumptive (also called non-lethal or trait-mediated) predator effects, coupled with prey defences, are key contributors to prey stability. This has a positive effect on both the predator and the food organism of the prey. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In aquatic systems, prey animals associate predation risk with cues that originate either from the predator or from injured conspecifics. Sources and benefits of these cues have received considerable attention in river, lake, and pond ecosystems but are less well understood in small container ecosystems that can hold less than a liter of water. Mosquitoes Aedes triseriatus (Say) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) encounter predatory Corethrella appendiculata (Grabham) and Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett) in small containers and show antipredatory behavioral responses. We investigated the sources of the predation cues to which these prey larvae respond. We tested whether Ae. albopictus larvae show behavioral responses to cues emanating from the predator or from damage to prey caused by the act of predation. We also tested whether Ae. triseriatus respond to cues present in fluid or solid residues from predator activity. Ae. albopictus showed behavioral modifications only in response to waterborne cues from a feeding predator and not to cues from a starving predator, indicating that Ae. albopictus respond to cues created by the act of predation, which could include substances derived from damaged prey or substances in predator feces. Ae. triseriatus showed behavioral responses to solid residues from predation but not to fluid without those solids, indicating that the cues to which they respond originate in predator feces or uneaten prey body parts. Our results suggest that cues in this system may be primarily chemicals that are detected upon contact with solid residues that are products of the feeding processes of these predators. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={Evaluation of the behavioral 'costs', such as effort expenditure relative to the benefits of obtaining reward, is a major determinant of goal-directed action. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the human medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) is involved in this calculation and thereby guides goal-directed and choice behavior, but this region's functional significance in rodents is unknown despite extensive work characterizing the role of the lateral OFC in cue-related response inhibition processes. We first tested mice with mOFC lesions in an instrumental reversal task lacking discrete cues signaling reinforcement; here, animals were required to shift responding based on the location of the reinforced aperture within the chamber. Mice with mOFC lesions acquired the reversal but failed to inhibit responding on the previously reinforced aperture, while mice with prelimbic prefrontal cortex lesions were unaffected. When tested on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, mice with prelimbic cortical lesions were unable to maintain responding, resulting in declining response levels. Mice with mOFC lesions, by contrast, escalated responding. Neither lesion affected sensitivity to satiety-specific outcome devaluation or non-reinforcement (i.e. extinction), and neither had effects when placed after animals were trained on a progressive ratio response schedule. Lesions of the ventral hippocampus, which projects to the mOFC, resulted in similar response patterns, while lateral OFC and dorsal hippocampus lesions resulted in response acquisition, though not inhibition, deficits in an instrumental reversal. Our findings thus selectively implicate the rodent mOFC in braking reinforced goal-directed action when reinforcement requires the acquisition of novel response contingencies. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={In the constant darkness of cave environments fish locomotion has to be directed by nonvisual spatial information. Four series of tests were done to determine the ability of the hypogean cyprinid Phreatichthys andruzzii Vinciguerra, 1924 to memorize a synthetic chemical cue (morpholine, C4H9NO), to associate it with an area, to utilize such information for direct locomotory activity, and to determine how long that association is retained in fish memory. Although morpholine acts as neutral stimulus for P. andruzzii, after acclimation in morpholine-scented areas devoid of food resources specimens showed a clear tendency to avoid waters characterized by the odour of that chemical. We hypothesize that an association between odours and trophic characteristics of an area allows the fish to optimize their exploratory activity, as it allows them to recognize areas already experienced to be devoid of trophic resources and to avoid these as unprofitable places. The above association seems to be memorized for a short time; the behavioural response vanishing between 6 and 18 h after the end of the acclimation period. After a certain time has elapsed, it could be profitable to visit the same areas again to verify the incidental availability of new food sources.},

abstract={Sessile colonial invertebrates that must tolerate environmental variation without the luxury of mobility may be expected to cope with such variation through phenotypic plasticity. While plastic responses to a range of biotic factors (e.g. predation) are increasingly documented, the details of responses to competition (mediated by the densities of conspecifics or heterospecifics vying for the same resources) remain unclear, despite a rich literature for terrestrial plants on which to draw. We examined phenotypic responses to conspecific density in a colonial invertebrate (the arborescent bryozoan, Bugula neritina) under field conditions. We found that colonies at higher densities were generally less fecund, lower in biomass and more elongate than those growing virtually alone. We also found such responses to vary only subtly with the life history stage of neighbours, with colonies exposed to higher densities of contemporary recruits achieving elongation via increased budding between bifurcation points and the elongation of individual zooids, while colonies exposed to established adults achieved elongation via increased budding only. These responses are broadly consistent with those of terrestrial plants competing for light and are probably due to the combined effects of resource limitation and altered flow in high density stands. Future studies are needed to disentangle these effects and the extent to which such responses to density in branching colonial invertebrates are a passive result of food limitation, or reflect active (and potentially adaptive) plasticity to other aspects of the local density environment. © Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract={Escape theory predicts that a prey should start escaping (flight initiation distance = FID) from a predator when the costs of fleeing and the cost staying are equal or until future fitness is maximized. Consequently, prey escape performances and current reproductive asset can affect FID. We tested effects of body condition, morphology, and whether the tail was regenerated or original on FID in the Balearic lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) by ourselves simulating predators. Lizards with better body condition had longer FID and lizards with longer intact tails had shorter FID. Lizards with regenerated tail presented shorter FID than lizards with intact tails. These results suggest that impaired escape performance is counterbalanced by fitness costs of tail regeneration or by alteration of escape behaviour. The weak association between morphology, body condition and FID suggest that escape performances and asset protection have relatively small effect on P. lilfordi escape decisions. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={Health is a multidimensional and continual concept. Traditional latent analytic approaches have inherent deficits in capturing the complex nature of the concept; however, the Grade of Membership (GoM) model is well suited for this problem. We applied the GoM method to a set of 31 indicators to construct ideal profiles of health status based on physical, mental and social support items among 848 adult twins from Qingdao, China. Four profiles were identified: healthy individuals (pure type I), individuals with personality disorders (pure type II), individuals with mental impairments (pure type III) and individuals with physical impairments (pure type IV). The most frequently occurring combination in this population was profiles I, II, IV (14.74%), followed by profiles I, II, III, IV (13.44%), and then type I (11.08%). Only 13.56% of subjects fell completely into one single pure type, most individuals exhibited some of the characteristics of two or more pure types. Our results indicated that, compared to conventional statistical methods, the GoM model was more suited to capture the complex concept of health, reflecting its multidimensionality and continuity, while also exhibiting preferable reliability. This study also made an important contribution to research on GoM application in non-independent samples.},

abstract={The authors examined the role of food insecurity in the etiology of children's cognitive and mental health problems. Data from a prospective longitudinal study of 1,116 United Kingdom families with twins (sample constructed in 1999-2000) were used to test associations among household food insecurity; income; maternal personality; household sensitivity to children's needs; and children's cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development. Food-insecure children had lower IQs and higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems relative to their peers. After differences in household income, the personalities of children's mothers, and the sensitivity of household organization to children's needs were accounted for, food-insecure children had moderately higher levels of emotional problems relative to food-secure children (β = 0.22, P = 0.02). Differences in children's cognitive development were accounted for by household income, and differences in their behavioral development were accounted for by their mothers' personalities and their households' sensitivity to children's needs. Results suggest that food insecurity was associated with school-aged children's emotional problems but not with their cognitive or behavioral problems after accounting for differences in the home environments in which children were reared. Mothers' personality and household sensitivity to children's needs may present challenges to improving outcomes of children with food insecurity. © 2010 The Author.},

abstract={Dieting is an important risk factor for disordered eating and eating disorders. Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from dieting and restrictive eating, abnormal eating behavior, and finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence of eating disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the cause of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the paradigm of appearance in the specific sport, (b) perceived performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural pressures for thinness or an " ideal" body. Athletes most at risk for disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin body size/shape, a high power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports utilizing weight categories, such as in some high-intensity sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to lose weight, frequent weight cycling, early start of sport-specific training, overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate coaching behavior, are important risk factors. To prevent disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for eating disorders. Coaches and leaders must accept that disordered eating can be a problem in the athletic community and that openness regarding this challenge is important. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={Background: Childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for mood, anxiety, impulse control, and substance disorders. Although genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of such disorders, the neurobiological mechanisms involved are poorly understood. A reliable mouse model of early life adversity leading to lasting behavioral changes would facilitate progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these adverse effects. Maternal separation is a commonly used model of early life neglect, but has led to inconsistent results in the mouse.Results: In an effort to develop a mouse model of early life neglect with long-lasting behavioral effects in C57BL/6 mice, we designed a new maternal separation paradigm that we call Maternal Separation with Early Weaning (MSEW). We tested the effects of MSEW on C57BL/6 mice as well as the genetically distinct DBA/2 strain and found significant MSEW effects on several behavioral tasks (i.e., the open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test) when assessed more than two months following the MSEW procedure. Our findings are consistent with MSEW causing effects within multiple behavioral domains in both strains, and suggest increased anxiety, hyperactivity, and behavioral despair in the MSEW offspring. Analysis of pup weights and metabolic parameters showed no evidence for malnutrition in the MSEW pups. Additionally, strain differences in many of the behavioral tests suggest a role for genetic factors in the response to early life neglect.Conclusions: These results suggest that MSEW may serve as a useful model to examine the complex behavioral abnormalities often apparent in individuals with histories of early life neglect, and may lead to greater understanding of these later life outcomes and offer insight into novel therapeutic strategies. © 2010 George et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Invasive predators may change their own trophic conditions by progressively displacing or reducing diversity and abundance of native prey. As food quality and quantity are two main factors determining adult body size in arthropods, alteration of the available resources may thus affect predators' morphology. The flightless carabid beetle Merizodus soledadinus was accidentally introduced to Iles Kerguelen in a single site in 1913. Its successful spreading process has been monitored over the long term, providing an exceptional research opportunity with multiple snapshots of similar colonized sites mostly differing by the residence time of M. soledadinus. To test if M. soledadinus' morphology is correlated with its residence time in each habitat, we measured nine morphometric traits in five populations. We detected significant morphological differences: individuals from the first colonized site were the smallest, whereas individuals from the most recently colonized site were the largest. Our study also highlighted among-site variation in sexual dimorphism of the last abdominal sternite: its length differed between sites for females, but not for males. We discuss this diminution of M. soledadinus' size in the light of both a priori (development under diet restriction, survival) and a posteriori (intrapopulation competition, cannibalism) effects on growth and development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Objective: This exploratory study examines the role of psychosocial-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) at 14-20 weeks of gestation. Method: One hundred and twenty women were enrolled into the study. Blood samples were collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Participants completed questionnaires that included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES) Depression Scale, the Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety (PAS) Scale, the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test, the Brief COPE scale, and questions regarding violence/abuse, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns. Results: Pregnant women with high CRH levels (15 pcg/ml and above) perceived their income to be inadequate, slept more hours at night, stood more hours during the day, and used the coping styles of disengagement or religion but not humor. Logistic regression identified three predictors for high CRH (accounting for 42.2% of the variance): perceived inadequacy of income and the use of "religion" and "disengagement" to cope with stress. Conclusions: These results are the first known to identify coping style and perceived income inadequacy as predictors of high CRH. Women with perceived inadequacy of income had almost three times the odds for high CRH. Women who used religion or disengagement to cope with stress had 14 times and 7 times the odds for high CRH levels, respectively. Higher CRH levels are associated with preterm birth (PTB). Thus, it may be important to include maternal coping style and perceptions of income inadequacy in future investigations of CRH levels and PTB. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Activity-based anorexia is a paradigm that induces increased physical activity, reduced food intake, and heightened activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in adult rats. To investigate whether experience with activity-based anorexia produced enduring effects on brain and behavior, female adolescent rats experienced activity-based anorexia during adolescence and were tested in adulthood for anxiety-like behavior on an elevated plus maze and in an open field. Analysis of elevated plus maze and open field behavior in adulthood revealed that rats that experienced activity-based anorexia during adolescence, but not rats that were simply food restricted, displayed increased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Plasma corticosterone and expression levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and in the central nucleus of the amygdala were significantly elevated in adult rats that had undergone activity-based anorexia in adolescence in response to the open field exposure, as compared to control rats. These data demonstrate enduring effects of adolescent activity-based anorexia on anxiety-like behavior and neuroendocrine factors critical in stress responsivity in adulthood. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activity-based anorexia during adolescence serves as a model whereby prolonged anxiety is induced, allowing for evaluation of the behavioral and neural correlates of mediating anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Serotonin transporter (SERT) has been associated with drugs of abuse like d-methamphetamine (METH). METH is well known to produce effects on the monoamine systems but it is unclear how METH affects SERT and memory. Here the effects of METH and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) on autoshaping and novel object recognition (NOR) were investigated. Notably, both memory tasks recruit different behavioral, neural and cognitive demand. In autoshaping task a dose-response curve for METH was determined. METH (1.0. mg/kg) impaired short-term memory (STM; lasting less of 90. min) in NOR and impaired both STM and long-term memory (LTM; lasting 24 and 48. h) in autoshaping, indicating that METH had long-lasting effects in the latter task. A comparative autoradiography study of the relationship between the binding pattern of SERT in autoshaping new untrained vs. trained treated (METH, FLX, or both) animals was made. Considering that hemispheric dominance is important for LTM, hence right vs. left hemisphere of the brain was compared. Results showed that trained animals decreased cortical SERT binding relative to untrained ones. In untrained and trained treated animals with the amnesic dose (1.0. mg/kg) of METH SERT binding in several areas including hippocampus and cortex decreased, more remarkably in the trained animals. In contrast, FLX improved memory, increased SERT binding, prevented the METH amnesic effect and re-established the SERT binding. In general, memory and amnesia seemed to make SERT more vulnerable to drugs effects. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The digestive system is the interface between the supply of food for an animal and the demand for energy and nutrients to maintain the body, to grow, and to reproduce. Digestive systems are not morphologically static but rather dynamically respond to changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the diet and the level of food intake. In this article, we discuss three themes that affect the ability of an animal to alter digestive function in relation to novel substrates and changing food supply: (1) the fermentative digestion in herbivores, (2) the integration of cardiopulmonary and digestive functions, and (3) the evolution of dietary specialization. Herbivores consume, digest, and detoxify complex diets by using a wide variety of enzymes expressed by bacteria, predominantly in the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Carnivores, such as snakes that feed intermittently, sometimes process very large meals that require compensatory adjustments in blood flow, acid secretion, and regulation of acid-base homeostasis. Snakes and birds that specialize in simple diets of prey or nectar retain their ability to digest a wider selection of prey. The digestive system continues to be of interest to comparative physiologists because of its plasticity, both phenotypic and evolutionary, and because of its widespread integration with other physiological systems, including thermoregulation, circulation, ventilation, homeostasis, immunity, and reproduction. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={The growth of sibling dorada Brycon moorei (Characidae) housed individually in small enclosures (0·25 l; 27·0° C, range ±0·5° C; 12L:12D) from the egg stage was examined at regular intervals until 36 days after hatching (dah) and compared with their behaviour. From 1 to 8 dah, when cannibalism is intense among B. moorei raised in groups, there was no significant increase of size heterogeneity among isolated fish (c.v. of total length of 3·1 and 3·6%, at 1 and 8 dah, respectively) and no primacy of early size differences either. These results suggest that cannibals of B. moorei raised in groups are not natural-born killers with greater growth capacities than others. Size heterogeneity among isolated fish increased significantly first when B. moorei were weaned on formulated feed (8-15 dah), then again from 24 to 36 dah when the average growth rate was half as fast as before (c. 0·5 v. 1·0 mm day -1), despite fish consistently feeding. During both periods, there was a significant, positive relationship between individual growth and aggression or boldness. These results suggest that (1) boldness can favour the transition to a new food type and (2) fish exhibited a variable responsiveness to spatial restriction in small enclosures, which may have been alleviated in some individuals by establishment of territorial behaviour, as suggested by their enhanced aggression. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Atlantic salmon exhibit massive variation in growth, and here we review the patterns and allometric, genotypic, maternal and environmental sources of the variation. However, growth is also behaviourally fl exible and infl uenced by behavioural trade - offs with survival - related traits. We suggest a conceptual framework that addresses growth variation throughout the salmon life cycle based on such behavioural trade - offs. Under this framework both seasonal freshwater growth variation and the large difference in growth between fresh water and sea water are related to the trade - off between feeding to maximise growth and sheltering to avoid predation under different seasonal conditions and habitat characteristics. A link has recently been established between female spawning behaviour and variation in offspring growth (through local density regulation of growth), further emphasising the importance of behavioural traits for growth variation. Finally, growth is also state - dependent, with growth being accelerated or depressed according to physiological or life - history states. No model has so far been developed that accounts for the complex interactions of abiotic factors, biotic interactions, physiological and life - history states and the behavioural fl exibility of growth. However, even the simple temperature - driven growth models have proven their value as baselines for Atlantic salmon performance. Currently, field - based models are being developed that incorporate more sources of growth variation, and if extended into generic models they should become valuable tools in many aspects of the science and management of Atlantic salmon. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Rats use their vibrissa (whiskers) to explore and navigate the environment. These sensory signals are distributed within the brain stem by the trigeminal complex and are also relayed to the superior colliculus in the midbrain and to the thalamus (and subsequently barrel cortex) in the forebrain. In the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, whisker-evoked responses are driven by direct inputs from the trigeminal complex (trigeminotectal) and feedback from the barrel cortex (corticotectal). But the effects of the behavioral state of the animal on the spontaneous firing and sensory responses of these neurons are unknown. By recording from freely behaving rats, we show that the spontaneous firing of whisker sensitive neurons in superior colliculus is higher, or in an activated mode, during active exploration and paradoxical sleep and much lower, or in a quiescent/deactivated mode, during awake immobility and slow-wave sleep. Sensory evoked responses in superior colliculus also depend on behavioral state. Most notably, feedback corticotectal responses are significantly larger during the quiescent/deactivated mode, which tracks the barrel cortex responses on which they depend. Finally, sensory evoked responses depend not only on the state of the animal but also on the orienting response elicited by the stimulus, which agrees with the well known role of the superior colliculus in orienting about salient stimuli.

abstract={Proximate mediators of reproductive behaviors in vertebrates have a long history of study. In fishes, relatively few studies have focused on hormonal control of parental care, despite a comprehensive background on the general physiology of fishes, and the frequent occurrence of parental care behaviors. Studies on this taxon have repeatedly found that the relationships between androgens and paternal care do not follow the predictions made in the avian and mammalian literature. Glucocorticoids may also have a role in mediating parental behaviors, possibly through their role as regulators of metabolism. As such, we investigated the role of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and cortisol in mediating parental effort of male smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) by manipulating hormone titers in wild fish. In smallmouth bass, males spawn annually with a single female and defend a single brood for up to 30. days. Treatment of parental fish with cyproterone acetate (CYA; an androgen receptor antagonist) resulted in a decrease in nest defense in response to a simulated brood predator; however, no changes in nest success, nest tending or biochemical indicators of nutritional status were detected. Treatment with exogenous cortisol did not change parental behavior, but did increase the rate of nest failure, possibly owing to the energetic cost of chronically elevated cortisol concentrations. We discuss these findings in the context of resource-driven trade-offs and highlight life history as an important factor controlling parental effort in species with costly parental care behaviors. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Osteoporosis is one of the major disorders of our time and is increasing at an alarming rate. It affects over 10 million women in the United States and is expected to affect 14 million by the year 2020. There are a number of risk factors for osteoporosis that are of a modifiable nature; however, many women do not take the necessary precautions to prevent the disease. The reasons that women do not actively engage in preventative and remedial strategies to deal with the potential for osteoporosis are complex. It is clear that women must have adequate knowledge to make informed decisions regarding osteoprotective behaviors. Social workers are in a unique position to provide interventions not only on a micro level (educating individual clients) but also on a macro level in terms of large-scale education campaigns focusing on nutrition and exercise both in children and in adults. This article examines the reasons for the failure of women to engage in osteoprotective behaviors by exploring barriers to prevention and their impact on social work policy, practice, and research.

abstract={In many taxa the timing of metamorphosis is plastic in response to predation risk during the pre-metamorphic stage, and trends in both age and body size at metamorphosis have been the subject of much study. The responses to cues of predators are predominantly to be larger or equal-sized at the same age or older at metamorphosis. These observations are in direct contrast with existing theoretical treatments of this plasticity, which mostly predict earlier and smaller metamorphosis and never later and larger metamorphosis without invoking indirect effects on growth rate. Here we resolve the discrepancy between theory and observation using a dynamic state-dependent model that incorporates morphological and behavioral responses to predation risk. We allow prey to choose the optimal activity level and/ or investment in defense over the growth period. We show that under certain conditions, metamorphosis at a larger size and later time is likely to be optimal. Our analysis allows us to make testable predictions about the changes in activity level of prey as they grow and how the effect of providing refuges will vary with predator type. Several of these predictions are supported by a meta-analysis of metamorphic responses to caged predators by larval amphibians and insects. Our predictions lead to insights about the feedback effects of antipredator responses on growth and subsequent implications for life history. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The goal of this research was to evaluate the personal health behaviors of physicians in training and attending physicians in association with patient-related lifestyle counseling. Physicians at a major teaching hospital were surveyed regarding their personal lifestyle behavior, perceived confidence, and frequency of counseling patients regarding lifestyle behaviors. One hundred eighty-three total responses were received. Trainees were more likely to consume fast food and less likely to consume fruits and vegetables than attendings. Attending physicians were more likely to exercise 4 or more days per week and more than 150 minutes per week. Attending physicians were more likely to counsel their patients regarding a healthy diet (70.7% vs 36.3%, P< .0001) and regular exercise (69.1% vs 38.2%, P <0001) compared with trainees. Few trainees or attendings were confident in their ability to change patients' behaviors. Predictors of confidence in counseling for exercise included the provider's own exercise time of >150 minutes per week, being overweight, and reported adequate training in counseling. Only adequate training in counseling was a predictor of strong self-efficacy for counseling in diet. Many physicians lack confidence in their ability to counsel patients regarding lifestyle. Personal behaviors including regular exercise and better training in counseling techniques may improve patient counseling. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The genic capture model offers a promising solution to the lek paradox. Heightened condition dependency of sexually selected traits is a prerequisite of this model. Condition dependency is empirically inferred by the sensitivity of traits to stressors. The magnitude of ecological stress (e.g., competition and predation) experienced by populations varies considerably. Thus, condition dependence should manifest more in populations experiencing higher levels of stress. We experimentally assessed the sensitivity of a sexually selected trait (posterior gnathopod) to food resource stress in an amphipod species. We found that gnathopod size variation was 59% higher under food stress, with no corresponding effect on nonsexually selected traits. In addition, we assessed levels of gnathopod variation and the allometry of gnathopods for males sampled from natural populations for two amphipod species that experience different levels of stress (driven by contrasting size-selective predation and associated life-history trade-offs). Populations that experience higher resource stress had both steeper allometries and greater gnathopod size variation. These results suggest that the magnitude of ecological stress experienced by natural populations strongly impacts condition dependency of sexually selected traits, and could play an important role in shaping trait variation and thus the opportunity for sexual selection. © 2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Objective. Self-initiated plans relating to when, where, and how behaviour will be performed have been shown to be effective in promoting goal progress. The current study (N = 256) explored whether any impact of self-initiated implementation intentions on the avoidance of snacking was moderated by impulsivity. Design and methods. The study employed a prospective design. At Time 1, participants reported the extent to which they had formed self-initiated implementation intentions to avoid eating high-calorie snacks. At Time 2, participants reported their snack consumption over the preceding 2 weeks and completed a measure of impulsivity. Results. Impulsivity (urgency) moderated the effect of self-initiated implementation intentions on snack consumption. Specifically, self-initiated implementation intentions benefited the avoidance of snacking most for those low in impulsivity and least for those high in impulsivity. Conclusion. The findings suggest that impulsivity might form an important boundary condition to the effectiveness of self-initiated implementation intention formation in relation to snacking. © 2010 The British Psychological Society.},

abstract={Growing public concerns about lethal methods to mitigate humanwildlife conflicts place increasing constraints on wildlife management options. Translocations, perceived as humane and non-lethal solutions, are increasingly advocated to resolve these conflicts. The present study summarises the literature on translocations of wild mammals, with particular emphasis on 'problem' animals, reviews the impact of translocations on survival, behaviour, animal welfare and potential spread of diseases, and evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of translocations to mitigate humanwildlife conflicts. Translocations may have a detrimental impact on survival rates and lead to extreme dispersal movements. In some species, stress-related capture results in substantial mortality. In other species, homing causes animals to leave the release area. In addition, some animals resume the nuisance behaviour at the release site. Individuals that survive a translocation may suffer from malnutrition, dehydration, decreased immunocompetence and predation. Supportive measures such as acclimatisation pens and provision of food and shelter can drastically reduce post-release dispersal movements and mortality, although the adoption of these measures increases the cost of translocation. Translocations have the potential to spread diseases to conspecifics, humans, domestic animals and livestock. Health surveillance, seldom implemented, is likely to add significantly to the cost of translocation. Very few studies have reported the costs of translocations or addressed which stakeholders are expected to pay for translocating problem animals. Alternative management options are rarely mentioned. Despite the perceived humaneness of translocations to mitigate humanwildlife conflicts, the fate of translocated animals has been rarely monitored. In addition, very few studies have mentioned whether and for how long the conflict was resolved. We suggest that determining whether the translocation leads to the resolution of the problem should be the main criterion to evaluate the success of the translocation of problem animals. We propose a list of criteria to assist decisions regarding the suitability, effectiveness and humaneness of translocations to manage problems posed by wild mammals. © 2010 CSIRO.},

abstract={There is considerable evidence for induction of differential risk of noncommunicable diseases in humans by variation in the quality of the early life environment. Studies in animal models show that induction and stability of induced changes in the phenotype of the offspring involve altered epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation and covalent modifications of histones. These findings indicate that such epigenetic changes are highly gene specific and function at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides. Interventions using plementation with folic acid or methyl donors during pregnancy, or folic acid after weaning, alter the phenotype and epigenotype induced by maternal dietary constraint during gestation. This suggests a possible means for reducing risk of induced noncommunicable disease, although the design and conduct of such interventions may require caution. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in understanding the mechanism that underlies the early life origins of disease and to place these studies in a broader life-course context.

abstract={It is well known that maternal nutritional status is important to the development of mammalian offspring. We examined the effect of maternal food restriction during lactation on offspring in mice. From 1 to 21 days after parturition, control dams (CDs) were fed with the standard amounts of daily food consumption, whereas dietary restricted dams (RDs) received 70% of daily food consumption. Although the mean body weight of RDs was not significantly different from that of the CDs, body weight of the offspring from RD (RD offspring) was significantly lower than that of the offspring from CD (CD offspring). The difference was detectable until 10 weeks of age. Body lengths and brain weights of RD offspring at postnatal day 22 were lower than those of the CD offspring. Plasma concentrations of leptin in RD offspring decreased significantly. But plasma concentrations of growth hormone and thyroxin were not different between the two groups. In the open field tests, total distance was significantly decreased in RD offspring compared with CD offspring. In the hole-board test, head dip latency was increased and the number of dips was decreased significantly in RD offspring. In the elevated plus maze test, total distance and risk assessment were significantly decreased in the RD offspring. There was no difference between the two groups in the rota-rod and wire-hang tests. These results suggest that maternal dietary restriction during lactation can affect the growth, locomotor activity and anxiety behavior of offspring, but not motor or neuromuscular function. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Among mammals, social ranking is generally thought to affect the outcome of disputes over preferred, limited or future resources. Therefore, we should expect individuals' preference for conspecifics to be affected by their own and other individuals' competition capacity. Here, we investigated the social preference and behavioural response in farmed silver fox vixens (Vulpes vulpes) towards unfamiliar vixens of different competition capacities, measured by their ability to compete for and defend a limited food resource, in a choice test. We found that low competition capacity vixens spent significantly less time in front of the high competition capacity vixens (2647 ± 600 s) compared to the time they spent in front of the low competition capacity vixens (6041 ± 877 s, P<0.05). In addition, the low competition capacity vixens spent significantly less time in front of the high competition capacity vixens (2647 ± 600 s) compared to what the high competition capacity vixens did (4215 ± 657 s, P=0.03). This suggests that low competition capacity vixens perceive high competition capacity vixens as a greater potential threat than high competition capacity vixens do. Time spent in social exploration, resting, sitting and performing aggressive behaviours in front of a stimulus animal were also affected by competition capacity of the foxes. The vixens were also retreating significantly more from the high competition capacity vixens (2 ± 0.8 times) than from the low competition capacity vixens (0.4 ± 0.4 times, P=0.03), possibly reflecting that the high competition capacity vixens were more offensive than the low competition capacity vixens. Our results contribute to the knowledge of social behaviour in this species, and may have implications for the social housing environment of the farm foxes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Among other strategies to improve fish welfare in rearing environment, domestication and/or selective breeding was proposed to minimize fish responsiveness to husbandry practices. To verify this hypothesis on a recently domesticated specie, the sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, L., an experiment was realized, using four populations differing according to their level of domestication or selection: one population produced from wild parents (Wild), one population produced from parents domesticated for one generation (Domesticated) and two produced from parents selected for growth for one generation (Selected A and Selected B). The experiment was carried out over 91. days with 600 fish (50 fish per tank, 150 fish per population). After a control period, the fish were submitted from day 35 and during 56. days to a stress treatment including frequent and random application of 4 acute stressors (pursuing fish with a net during 1. min, switching off the light for 2. s during the day or, conversely, switching on the light for 2. s during the night, and overflying a bird predator silhouette above the tank during 30. s). The two variables that were measured, i.e.: fish self-feeding behavior and growth performance [at days (D) 14, 35, 63, and 91] were both altered, albeit differentially according to populations, by the stress treatment. During the first stress period (from D35 to D63), all groups modified their feeding rhythm and highly increased their feed intake while their growth rate decreased (Domesticated and both Selected fish groups) or remained stable (Wild). During the second stress period (from D64 to D91) fish continued to modify their feeding rhythm (being more and more diurnal) and increased again their feed intake; conversely to what happened during the first stress period, here, these modifications were associated with an improvement of the growth rate of all populations. During the whole experiment, both Selected groups and Domesticated fish were always characterized by a higher body mass, specific growth rate and body condition factor than Wild fish. In conclusion, and according to the results of this study, a first generation of domestication or selection improved fish growth performance but, at this early stage do not modify behavioral responses to repeated acute stress exposure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays an important role in neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses to stressors. In the present study, the effect of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on CRH neurons was investigated in rat brain. Methods: The rats were exposed to one of the stressors each day for 21 d. Immunostaining was performed to detect the CRH-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and in amygdala. Results: After the stress protocol, the animals showed a reduction in body weight gain as well as reduced sucrose preference and locomotor activity. Interestingly, the CRH neurons in both PVN and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) were stimulated by CUMS. The densities of CRH-containing neurons in both PVN and CeA were significantly higher than those in control group. Conclusion: The CRH systems in PVN and CeA may both contribute to depression-like behaviors during CUMS. © 2010 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A captive colony of 12 (4♂, 8♀) wombats, Lasiorhinus latifrons, was used to investigate stereotypic behaviour in this species and determine the beneficial effects of enrichment on wombat behaviour and wellbeing. The wombats were housed in four groups of 1♂ and 2♀, each in a separate enclosure and subjected to two different treatments: (1) enrichment, where the animals received two types of enrichment along with a treatment diet and (2) no-enrichment, where the animals received no such enrichment and were fed the standard diet. Each treatment was implemented twice, for a period of 12 weeks, in a pseudo-random order. Wombat behaviour was remotely observed via digital video surveillance. Each wombat was observed for 12 × 24-h periods during each treatment rotation with behaviours (both major and minor) being recorded at 5-min intervals over each 24-h sampling period. Eight (67%) of the captive wombats displayed a singular stereotypy in the form of straight-line pacing, boundary pacing, figure-8 pacing or wall climbing. Mean daily time spent stereotyping was variable between individuals (P<0.01) ranging from 61 to 129 min (4-9%), with a mean value of 86.9 ± 6.7 min (6.0 ± 0.5%). There was a significant (P≤0.02) increase in foraging (by 333%, from 7 to 30. min/day) and exploration (by 13%, from 70 to 79. min/day) in response to enrichment. However, enrichment had no effect (P≥0.13) on the time spent stereotyping or being inactive. Enrichment may have been unsuccessful at reducing stereotypic behaviour in the captive wombats due to the wrong type of enrichment being provided (i.e. the underlying problem motivating this behaviour may not have been addressed) or because the expression of this behaviour had become resistant to change, i.e. habit-like and/or perseverative. Although stereotyping and inactivity were not reduced by enrichment, it still resulted in improved welfare as the animals were given more stimulus diversity, had more choice in behaviour options, had more opportunity to interact with their environment and were able to express a larger amount of natural behaviour. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={1. Aposematic animals advertise their defences to predators via warning signals that often are bright colours combined with black patterns. Predation is assumed to select for large pattern elements and conspicuousness of warning signals because this enhances avoidance learning of predators. However, conspicuousness of the colour pattern can vary among individuals of aposematic species, suggesting that warning signal expression may be constrained by opposing selection pressures. If effective warning signals are costly to produce, variation in signal expression may be maintained via physiological trade-offs. To understand the costs of signalling that might underlay both physiological and ecological trade-offs, it is crucial to identify the pigments involved in aposematic traits, how they or their precursors are acquired and how their production and/or deposition interact with other physiological processes. 2. We characterized the pigments responsible for the genetically and phenotypically variable orange-black warning signal of the hairy larvae of an Arctiid moth, Parasemia plantaginis. We tested orange and black coloured hairs for the presence of six candidate pigment types using high-performance liquid chromatography, spectral and solubility analyses. 3. After excluding the presence of carotenoids, ommochromes, pterins and pheomelanins in orange hairs, our results suggest that tiger moth larvae produce their orange warning signal by depositing both diet-derived flavonoids and trace levels of synthesized eumelanin in their hairs. The nearby black hairs are coloured by eumelanin. 4. In light of previous studies, we conclude that although a large orange patch increases the 1larvae's antipredator efficacy, variation in the size of orange patches within a population can be driven by scarcity of flavonoids in diet. However, traces of eumelanin found in the orange hairs of the larvae may also play a significant role in the maintenance of the signal pattern on poor quality diets. 5. The goal of the future studies will be to test the condition dependence of pigment deposition in aposematic colour patterns by directly manipulating relevant nutritional parameters such as dietary flavonoid or nitrogen content (i.e. amino acid content). © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Stress exposure increases the risk of addictive drug use in human and animal models of drug addiction by mechanisms that are not completely understood. Mice subjected to repeated forced swim stress (FSS) before cocaine develop significantly greater conditioned place preference (CPP) for the drug-paired chamber than unstressed mice. Analysis of the dose dependency showed that FSS increased both the maximal CPP response and sensitivity to cocaine. To determine whether FSS potentiated CPP by enhancing associative learning mechanisms, mice were conditioned with cocaine in the absence of stress, then challenged after association was complete with the -opioid receptor (KOR) agonist U50,488 or repeated FSS, before preference testing. Mice challenged with U50,488 60 min before CPP preference testing expressed significantly greater cocaine-CPP than saline-challenged mice. Potentiation by U50,488 was dose and time dependent and blocked by the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). Similarly, mice subjected to repeated FSS before the final preference test expressed significantly greater cocaine-CPP than unstressed controls, and FSS-induced potentiation was blocked by norBNI. Novel object recognition (NOR) performance was not affected by U50,488 given 60 min before assay, but was impaired when given 15 min before NOR assay, suggesting that KOR activation did not potentiate CPP by facilitating memory retrieval or expression. The results from this study show that the potentiation of cocaine-CPP by KOR activation does not result from an enhancement of associative learning mechanisms and that stress may instead enhance the rewarding valence of cocaine-associated cues by a dynorphin-dependent mechanism. © 2010 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract={Insufficient availability of n-. 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) during pre- and neonatal development decreases accretion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6. n-. 3) in the developing brain. Low tissue levels of DHA are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, 1st- and 2nd-litter male Long-Evans rats were raised from conception on a Control diet containing α-linolenic acid (4.20. g/kg diet), the dietarily essential fatty acid precursor of DHA, or a diet Deficient in α-linolenic acid (0.38. g/kg diet). The Deficient diet resulted in a decrease in brain phospholipid DHA of 48% in 1st-litter pups and 65% in 2nd-litter pups. Activity, habituation, and response to spatial change in a familiar environment were assessed in a single-session behavioral paradigm at postnatal days 28 and 70, inclusive. Activity and habituation varied by age with younger rats exhibiting higher activity, less habituation, and less stimulation of activity induced by spatial novelty. During the first and second exposures to the test chamber, 2nd-litter Deficient pups exhibited higher levels of activity than Control rats or 1st-litter Deficient pups, and less habituation during the first exposure, but were not more active after introduction of a novel spatial stimulus. The higher level of activity in a familiar environment, but not after introduction of a novel stimulus is consistent with clinical observations in ADHD. The observation of this effect only in 2nd-litter rats fed the Deficient diet suggests that brain DHA content, rather than dietary n-. 3 PUFA content, likely underlies these effects. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Obesity is a major health challenge facing the modern world. Some evidence points to obesity itself as the main driver of premature mortality. We propose that this view is oversimplified. For example, high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or obese. To address this issue, we combine epidemiological and physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism. Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle. The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and epidemiologic data analysis are discussed in this article. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Epigenomic regulation, via DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA, is increasingly recognised as having a key role in normal development and function of an organism, acting to control cellular and tissue growth and differentiation. It is also thought to be involved in many complex diseases now common in the Western world, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is a range of evidence to suggest that nutrition plays a vital role in the protection from such diseases. However, there is little information about the role of nutrition on the epigenetic regulation of IBD. This review aims to elucidate the interactions of nutrients and the epigenome in IBD. More specifically, the plasticity of epigenetic modifications that occur due to low selenium and folate levels in the diet during gestation and lactation will be discussed. A better understanding of this plasticity, and of nutrient-epigenome interactions, will have important implications for enhancing human health through foods. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Pb (lead) exposure and stress are co-occurring risk factors (particularly in low socioeconomic communities) that also act on common biological substrates and produce common adverse outcomes, including cognitive impairments. This study sought to determine whether lifetime Pb exposure combined with prenatal stress would enhance the cognitive deficits independently associated with each of these risk factors and to explore associated mechanisms of any observed impairments. Learning was evaluated using a multiple schedule of repeated learning and performance in female rats subjected to lifetime Pb exposure (0 or 50 ppm Pb in drinking water beginning in dams 2 months prior to breeding; blood Pb levels ~10 μg/dl), to prenatal restraint stress on gestational days 16 and 17, or to both. Blood Pb, corticosterone levels, brain monoamines, and hippocampal nerve growth factor levels were also measured. Sequence-specific learning deficits produced by Pb, particularly the number of responses to correctly learn response sequences, were further enhanced by stress, whereas performance measures were unimpaired. Statistical analyses indicated significant relationships among corticosterone levels, frontal cortex dopamine (DA), nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover, and total responses required to learn sequences. This study demonstrates that Pb and stress can act together to produce selective and highly condition-dependent deficits in learning in female rats that may be related to glucocorticoid-mediated interactions with mesocorticolimbic regions of brain. These findings also underscore the critical need to evaluate toxicants in the context of other risk factors pertinent to human diseases and disorders. © The Author 2010.

abstract={Jumping spiders, or salticids, sample their environment using a combination of two types of eyes. The forward-facing pair of 'principal' eyes have narrow fields of view, but exceptional spatial resolution, while the two or three pairs of 'secondary' eyes have wide fields of view and function especially well as motion analysers. Motion detected by the secondary eyes may elicit an orienting response, whereupon the object of interest is examined further using the high-acuity principal eyes. The anterior lateral (AL) eyes are particularly interesting, as they are the only forward-facing pair of secondary eyes. In this study, we aimed to determine characteristics of stimuli that elicit orienting responses mediated by the AL eyes. After covering all eyes except the AL eyes, we measured orienting responses to dot stimuli that varied in size and contrast, and moved at different speeds. We found that all stimulus parameters had significant effects on orientation propensity. When tethered flies were used as prey, we found that visual information from the AL eyes alone was sufficient to elicit stalking behaviour. These results suggest that, in terms of overall visual processing, the relevance of spatial vision in the AL eyes has been underestimated in the literature. Our results also show that female spiders are significantly more responsive than males. We found that hunger caused similar increases in orientation propensity in the two sexes, but females responded more often than males both when sated and when hungry. A higher propensity by females to orient toward moving objects may be related to females tending to experience higher nutritional demands than males. © 2010.

abstract={In natural conditions, Griffon Vultures typically show shy behaviour and escape by flying if approached by humans. According to the state-dependent foraging theory, Griffon Vultures should modify their foraging behaviour depending on food availability and predation risk, humans being the main potential predator. We tested the Reaction Time (RT) and Flight Initiation Distance (FID) in five different artificial feeding schemes over three years in which food availability in the field varied significantly. The first scenario was set in a so-called "vulture restaurant", in which government employees feed vultures that may exhibit tame behaviour and stay within a few meters from a feeding person. Scenario 2 involved similar conditions, but here the researchers not employees placed the food in the vulture restaurant. The vultures did not land at the restaurant until one day had passed, and they flew away when people approached them within 250 m. The third scenario was established in a local zoo several months after the closure of the vulture restaurant. Here, employees fed captive vultures that were often accompanied by wild birds that landed to take food. The RT was 14.2 min and the FID was 50 m. The fourth scenario was established during the subsequent breeding season in a mountain where vultures were fed by the authors of the present study. The RT was 2.8 min and the FID was 15.2 m. The fifth scenario was established in another mountain after the breeding season. Now, the RT was 19.2 min and the FID was 52.2 m. These results demonstrate the ability of vultures to evaluate the predation risk depending on food availability and their state of hunger, and their ability to modify their behaviour from "natural" caution ("shyness") towards a more tolerant ("fearless") behaviour.},

abstract={Fledging is a major life transition for birds, when juveniles move from the safety of a nest into an environment where they must find food and avoid predators. The timing of fledging within a season can have significant effects on future survival and breeding success. Proximate triggers of fledging are unknown: though wing development is likely a primary factor, other physiological changes, such as elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT), may affect fledging behavior. Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) chicks have an extended post-hatching period during which they reach 150% of adult mass. However, approaching fledging, chicks fast for days to weeks and lose mass while still putting energy into feather growth. We evaluated chick morphology and physiology to elucidate proximate triggers of fledging. As in some other species, CORT increased as chicks fasted and lost body mass. At the same time, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) declined, thus amplifying free CORT prior to fledging. Once chicks reached a morphological threshold, free CORT levels predicted how long they stayed at the colony: chicks with higher free CORT fledged sooner. To perturb the relationship between body condition, endocrine physiology, and fledging behavior, we supplementally fed chicks for the month before fledging. Fed birds had a slower decrease in body mass, slower decrease in CBG, slower increase in free CORT, and stayed at the colony longer after reaching a morphological threshold. Our study suggests that as chicks lose mass, free CORT acts as a signal of energetic or nutritional state to adjust the timing of fledging. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Because the olfactory system plays a major role in food consumption, and because 'food addiction' and associated morbidities have reached epidemic proportions, we tested the hypothesis that dietary energy restriction can modify adverse effects of cocaine on behavior and olfactory cellular and molecular plasticity. Mice maintained on an alternate day fasting (ADF) diet exhibited increased baseline locomotion and increased cocaine-sensitized locomotion during cocaine conditioning, despite no change in cocaine conditioned place preference, compared with mice fed ad libitum. Levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the olfactory bulb (OB) were suppressed in mice on the ADF diet compared with mice on the control diet, independent of acute or chronic cocaine treatment. The expression of several enzymes involved in dopamine metabolism including tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidases A and B, and catechol-O-methyltransferase were significantly reduced in OBs of mice on the ADF diet. Both acute and chronic administration of cocaine suppressed the production of new OB cells, and this effect of cocaine was attenuated in mice on the ADF diet. Cocaine administration to mice on the control diet resulted in up-regulation of OB genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, cellular stress responses, and calcium- and cAMP-mediated signaling, whereas multiple olfactory receptor genes were down-regulated by cocaine treatment. ADF abolished many of the effects of cocaine on OB gene expression. Our findings reveal that dietary energy intake modifies the neural substrates underlying some of the behavioral and physiological responses to repeated cocaine treatment, and also suggest novel roles for the olfactory system in addiction. The data further suggest that modification of dietary energy intake could provide a novel potential approach to addiction treatments. © 2010 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

abstract={The hemispheres are asymmetrically involved in the reaction to stressful situations. In this sense, it is possible to speculate that the asymmetrical activation of the hemispheres, as a result of the exposure to a novel situation, may affect behavioural lateralization. We tested the hypothesis that novelty affects performance in a paw preference task in 37 habituated (HAB) and 37 control (CT) adult male Swiss mice. For 4 days prior to the first testing session, HAB mice were placed in the testing box daily. After the fourth session, animals were deprived of food for 24. h. On the 5th day, food pellets were placed inside a feeding tube and animals were allowed to make 25 successful retrievals of food pellets. The testing procedure was repeated 4 days later. CT mice were not submitted to the habituation sessions. A significant side-dependent difference in consistency of laterality was observed between groups in the first session: all (100%) right-pawed CT mice used their right paw to make their first successful retrieval of food in the first testing session, while only 61% of left-pawed mice used their left paw. The same pattern was observed when the first five retrievals were considered: 100% right-pawed CT mice and 72% left-pawed CT mice were consistent. No differences were observed in the HAB group: in both side-preference subgroups, 88% of the animals showed consistent laterality. These results indicate that behavioural lateralization in paw preference is affected by the novelty of the testing situation in a side-dependent manner. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Despite their importance for group-living animals, mechanisms that prevent aggressive escalation have seldom been investigated. Conflict prevention might imply the ability to foresee future needs and the question whether animals have this capacity is still open to debate. A few studies have suggested that animals may be able to use anticipatory strategies of conflict management to decrease stress levels and prevent social tension caused by food competition. None the less, the effectiveness of these supposedly preventive strategies has rarely been investigated, and their cognitive requirements are still unclear. We explored these issues by observing a group of captive capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, subject to fixed scheduled feeding. We collected data on affiliative and aggressive interactions during three conditions: prefeeding, feeding and control. We found that grooming increased before a predictable competitive situation such as scheduled feeding, and that grooming reduced the risk of aggressive escalation and increased co-feeding during the subsequent feeding period. Therefore, prefeeding grooming served as a conflict prevention mechanism. Nevertheless, capuchin monkeys did not specifically select their prefeeding grooming partners on the basis of the expected benefits in the future competitive situation, suggesting that they were not planning their future behaviour, but were probably responding to the current tense situation. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Most current wildlife habitat models, such as resource selection functions, typically assume a static environment, extrapolate poorly in space and time, and often lack linkages to population processes. We submit that more mechanistic habitat models that directly consider bottom-up resources affecting growth and reproduction (i.e., food) and top-down limitations affecting survival are needed to effectively predict habitat quality, especially in the presence of rapid environmental change. Here we present a general model for estimating potential habitat quality (relating to growth and reproduction) and realised habitat quality (accounting for survival) using basic knowledge of the species' seasonal diet, predicted locations of food resource patches and regional patterns in mortality risk. We illustrate our model for a threatened population of grizzly bears in west-central Alberta. Bi-monthly potential habitat quality successfully predicted habitat selection by radio-collared grizzly bears, while multi-seasonal realised habitat quality predicted patterns in occupancy-abundance as measured from unique bears at hair-snag sites. Bottom-up resources therefore predicted patterns of habitat selection, while top-down processes (survival) were necessary to scale-up to population measures. We suggest that more direct measures of resources and environments that affect growth, reproduction and survival, as well as match the temporal scale of animal behaviour, be considered when developing wildlife habitat models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Habitat fragmentation causes negative population trends or even local extinction in many species. Understanding the role of fragmentation on behavior and space use of animals is an essential part of revealing the mechanism behind observed population declines. We studied experimentally the effects of small-scale habitat fragmentation on the distribution and movement of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in seminatural enclosures. We predicted that besides habitat structure, availability of two resources, food for both sexes, and receptive females for males, determine individual distribution. We manipulated female density (either 0, 4, or 12 per enclosure) and followed movements of radio-collared males. We also studied the effect of unequal food distribution between the fragments on vole distribution. The habitat of 0.25-ha enclosures was manipulated by forming either one large, two medium-sized, or four small habitat patches surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Female density and distribution clearly affected male spacing behavior. Males had larger home ranges in the medium female density enclosures. Furthermore, the use of the inhospitable and risky matrix area increased with habitat fragmentation. Food supplementation improved individual condition measured as body mass but did not affect breeding success. Our experiments demonstrated that both small-scale habitat fragmentation and resource distribution affect the behavior and condition of individuals. Increased fragmentation led to increased risk taking in both mating and foraging behavior. This should have direct survival and fitness consequences, and therefore our results may be extrapolated to population-level consequences of habitat fragmentation. © 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

abstract={An attempt has been made here to delineate the manifold facets of the development story, or the under-development to which this eight per cent of the Indian population has been subjected to. The tribal conception of the inanimate world-agriculture, forest, land, water needs transformation. They have to realize that methods of traditional agronomic practices alone cannot support them. Yet, the vagaries of modern capital-intensive, commercialized agriculture are too risky for them as they overwhelmingly belong to the category of small and marginal farmers. The various development plans have left a mixed impression on the minds of the tribal people. They cannot forget their loss of land, their heavy indebtedness, the usury of money-lenders, the daily exploitation by contractors, traders, whereby thousands of our tribal men and women-folk labour under the system of bonded-labour and a curtailment of forest rights and privileges. The development schemes followed by the Government in the form of I.T.D.P, the T.S.P and M.A.D.A have failed to augment their income generational capacity on a sustainable basis. Consequently, schemes, which are considered as success stories by government agencies fail to empower the tribals in a real sense, for once the project period is completed, and the technical staff cum grass-root workers move out, the apparent statistical improvement in the tribals' income-generation abilities rapidly falls, and he is back to his old support base of the parasitical money-lender. The tribal person has to grapple on a daily basis with a fight for his day to day sustenance, and his poverty and lack of know-how of modern techniques of production makes him trapped in a perpetual subsistence-based economy. They are oriented to tasks, whether it be for sustenance or otherwise, which requires group dynamics to succeed, be it hunting, food-gathering, folk dancing etc. Thus, tasks requiring individual skill, risk, competition, innovation are alien to their personality make up. It is high time that development efforts include not only elevating the tribal people from their income deficit through micro-credit means but the severe deprivation which they suffer on all parameters of health and food security is also taken care of. The macro-economic policies of the government, however, fail to inspire any confidence, since from the late nineties, both long-term loans for infrastructural improvement and short-term crop-loans have fallen down drastically, and the loans to small and marginal farmers diminished too. The tribal youth of today has also become materialistic oriented, and, yet, his skill and education levels are not allowing him to access the very best in life. His harmony with nature has been disrupted, and he is caught between his admiration for the sophistication of urban lifestyle, and his rootedness in ancient traditions and practices. © Serials Publications.},

abstract={Both a family history of obesity and early childhood obesity have been identified as strong predictors of adult obesity risk. The finding that parental obesity, maternal obesity in particular, increases a child's risk for developing obesity suggests that either shared genes, or environment, or likely a combination of both may promote overeating and excessive weight gain in children. Parents not only create food environments for children's early experiences with food and eating, but they also influence their children's eating by modeling their own eating behaviors, taste preferences, and food choices. Thus, it is important to identify intermediary behavioral eating traits which promote overeating and obesity in children and to determine the extent to which associations between eating traits and excessive weight gain in children may be influenced by genetic factors, environmental factors, or both. Behavioral genetic methods can be used to help partition genetic and environmental sources of variability in behavioral traits. The focus of this paper is to review and discuss findings from both short-term experimental and prospective cohort studies on eating behaviors of children at various stages in their lives. Select child eating traits and parent-child resemblances in eating will be further examined in the context of children's home environment and their familial predisposition to obesity.

abstract={Recent public announcements stated that 60% to 85% of all microbial infections involve biofilms developed on natural tissues (skin, mucosa, endothelial epithelia, teeth, bones) or artificial devices (central venous, peritoneal and urinary catheters, dental materials, cardiac valves, intrauterine contraceptive devices, contact lenses, different types of implants). Prosthetic medical devices are risk factors of chronic infections in developed countries and these infections are characterized by slow onset, middle intensity symptoms, chronic evolution and resistance to antibiotic treatment. In case of biofilm development, a series of genes (40-60% of the prokaryotic genome) are modulated (activated/inhibited) by complex cell to cell signalling mechanisms and the biofilm cells become phenotypically distinct from their counterpart--free cells, being more resistant to stress conditions (including all types of antimicrobial substances); this resistance is phenotypical, behavioural and, more recently, called TOLERANCE. Four major mechanisms can account for biofilm antibiotic tolerance: (1) the failure of antibiotic penetration into the depth of a mature biofilm due to the biofilm matrix; (2) the accumulation of high levels of antibiotic degrading enzymes; (3) in the depth of biofilm, cells are experiencing nutrient limitation entering in a slow-growing or starved state; slow-growing or non-growing cells being not highly susceptible to antimicrobial agents, this phenomenon could be amplified by the presence of phenotypic variants or "persisters" and (4) biofilm's bacteria can turn on stress-response genes and switch to more tolerant phenotypes on exposure to environmental stresses; (5) genetic changes, probably selected by different stress conditions, such as mutations and gene transfer could occur inside the biofilm. In these conditions, biofilm associated infections require a different approach, both clinically and paraclinically.},

abstract={Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness that is associated with a lifetime of disability. For patients to successfully function in society, the amelioration of disease symptoms is imperative. The recently published results of two large antipsychotic clinical trials (e.g., CATIE, CUtLASS) clearly exemplified the limitations of currently available treatment options for schizophrenia, and further highlighted the critical need for novel drug discovery and development in this field. One of the biggest challenges in schizophrenia-related drug discovery is to find an appropriate animal model of the illness so that novel hypotheses can be tested at the basic science level. A number of pharmacological, genetic, and neurodevelopmental models have been introduced; however, none of these models has been rigorously evaluated for translational relevance or to satisfy requirements of "face," "construct" and "predictive" validity. Given the apparent polygenic nature of schizophrenia and the limited translational significance of pharmacological models, neurodevelopmental models may offer the best chance of success. The purpose of this review is to provide a general overview of the various neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia that have been introduced to date, and to summarize their behavioral and neurochemical phenotypes that may be useful from a drug discovery and development standpoint. While it may be that, in the final analysis, no single animal model will satisfy all the requirements necessary for drug discovery purposes, several of the models may be useful for modeling various phenomenological and pathophysiological components of schizophrenia that could be targeted independently with separate molecules or multi-target drugs.},

abstract={Metabolic factors acting during limited and sensitive time periods of pre- and postnatal development can induce lasting effects on health and disease risk in later life up to old age, including later obesity risk, which is referred to as early metabolic programming of long-term health. Three meta-analyses of observational studies found that obesity risk at school age was reduced with early breastfeeding compared to formula feeding. We assumed that breastfeeding protects against later obesity by reducing the occurrence of high weight gain in infancy and that one causative factor is the lower protein content of human milk compared to usual infant formulas (the "early protein hypothesis"). We are testing this hypothesis in the European Childhood Obesity Project, a double-blind, randomized clinical trial enrolling 1,678 infants in five countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain). We have randomized healthy in fants born at term to receive for the first year infant formula and follow-on formula with higher or lower protein contents, respectively. The follow-up data obtained at age 2 years indicates that feeding formula with reduced protein content normalizes early growth relative to a breastfed reference group and the current WHO growth standard, which may furnish a significant long-term protection against later obesity. We conclude that infant feeding practice has a high potential for long-term health effects. The results obtained should stimulate the review of recommendations and policies for infant formula composition. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract={Background: We examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Barbadian youth with histories of infantile malnutrition and in a healthy comparison group and the extent to which the effect of malnutrition was mediated/moderated by maternal depression. Methods: Depressive symptoms were assessed using a 20-item scale administered to youths (11-17 years of age) who had experienced an episode of protein-energy malnutrition (marasmus or kwashiorkor) during the first year of life and in a comparison group of healthy youths without a history of malnutrition. Their mothers completed the same questionnaire on the same test on three occasions when their children were 5-17 years of age at 2-5-year intervals. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was elevated among previously malnourished youth relative to healthy comparison children (p <.001). When youth depression scores were subjected to a longitudinal multiple regression analysis, adjusting for the effect of maternal depressive symptoms, significant effects due to the history of early childhood malnutrition remained and were not discernibly attenuated from an unadjusted analysis. We also found significant independent effects of maternal depressive symptoms on youth depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Early childhood malnutrition contributed independently to depressive symptoms in youths who experienced a significant episode of malnutrition in the first year of life. This relationship was not mediated or moderated by the effects of maternal depression. Whether the later vulnerability to depression is a direct effect of the episode of malnutrition and related conditions early in life or whether it is mediated by the more proximal neurobehavioral effects of the malnutrition remains to be determined. © 2010 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.},

abstract={In Burkina Faso, prolonged breastfeeding with introduction of ritual fluids from birth is a deep-seated norm. We explored HIV-infected mothers' views and experiences of the acceptability and feasibility of the World Health Organization's recommended infant-feeding options within a mother-to-child-transmission prevention trial. A qualitative study was conducted on 17 formula-feeding and 19 breastfeeding mothers, from a larger cohort of 51 eligible HIV-infected women, consenting to participate in separate focus group discussions in early post-partum. Mothers opted for breastfeeding essentially out of fear of family rejection. Most of them were afraid of denigration for disrespecting tradition if they formula-fed or being suspected of HIV infection. Achieving exclusive breastfeeding remained a difficult challenge as they engaged in a continuous struggle with close elders to avoid fluid feeding. Additional stress and fatigue were fed by their perception of a high transmission risk through breast milk. Exclusive formula-feeding seemed easier to implement, especially as formula was provided free of charge. Formula-feeding mothers more frequently had a supportive partner, a strong personality and lived in better socio-economic conditions than breastfeeding mothers (76% had education and electricity supply vs. 42%, respectively). Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months remains the most appropriate option for many HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa. Its acceptability and feasibility urgently need to be improved by promoting it as the best feeding option for all infants. Other crucial interventions are the promotion of voluntary counselling and testing for couples, and greater partner involvement in infant-feeding counselling. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The patients' experiences of physical signs and symptoms, anxiety and depression, past serious medical conditions, use of self-prescribed medications, family history of poor mental/medical or physical health, nutritional problems and insufficient physical activities heightened their risk of coronary attack. Collectivist culture served as a big source of relieve to the patients. Patients' temperament, experience of different chronic life stresses/challenges, mood alteration, regular drinking, smoking/gambling, and family/social impairments compounded their health situation.

abstract={Plants infested with herbivores release specific volatile compounds that are known to recruit natural enemies. The response of natural enemies to these volatiles may be either learned or genetically determined. We asked whether there is genetic variation in the response of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis to methyl salicylate (MeSa). MeSa is a volatile compound consistently produced by plants being attacked by the two-spotted spider mite, the prey of P. persimilis. We predicted that predators express genetically determined responses during long-distance migration where previously learned associations may have less value. Additionally, we asked whether these responses depend on odors from uninfested plants as a background to MeSa. To infer a genetic basis, we analyzed the variation in response to MeSa among iso-female lines of P. persimilis by using choice-tests that involved either (1) MeSa presented as a single compound or (2) MeSa with background-odor from uninfested lima bean plants. These tests were conducted for starved and satiated predators, i. e., two physiological states, one that approximates migration and another that mimics local patch exploration. We found variation among iso-female lines in the responses to MeSa, thus showing genetic variation for this behavior. The variation was more pronounced in the starved predators, thus indicating that P. persimilis relies on innate preferences when migrating. Background volatiles of uninfested plants changed the predators' responses to MeSa in a manner that depended on physiological state and iso-female line. Thus, it is possible to select for context-dependent behavioral responses of natural enemies to plant volatiles. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background. Nutrition and predation have been considered two primary agents of selection important in the evolution of avian life history traits. The relative importance of these natural selective forces in the evolution of avian embryonic developmental period (EDP) remain poorly resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus on a single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes. The marine bird families Alcidae (auks) and Spheniscidae (penguins) exhibit marked variation in EDP, as well as behavioural and ecological traits ultimately linked to EDP. Therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a key life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relative importance of behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in the evolution of avian EDP. Results. Three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition and predation risk (i.e., clutch size, activity pattern, and nesting habits) were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and penguin EDP based on models predicting EDP from egg mass. Species with larger clutch sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and open nests had significantly shorter EDPs. Further, EDP was found to be longer among birds which forage in distant offshore waters, relative to those that foraged in near shore waters, in line with our predictions, but not significantly so. Conclusion. Current debate has emphasized predation as the primary agent of selection driving avian life history diversification. Our results suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective forces in the evolution of auk and penguin EDP, and highlight the importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic scales. We suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups will continue to constructively inform the debate on evolutionary determinants of avian EDP, as well as other life history parameters. © 2010 Hipfner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Polyspecific associations (PSA) are common in many African primate communities, including the diurnal primates at Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire. In this paper I use data on the PSA of two forest guenons, Campbell's (Cercopithecus campbelli) and lesser spot-nosed monkeys (C. petaurista), with Diana monkeys (C. diana) and other primates to clarify interspecific relationships during 17 months including a 3-month low-fruit period. I analyzed association in relation to fruit availability and measured forest strata use for C. campbelli and C. petaurista when alone and in associations with and without C. diana. I also measured predator risk and reactions to potential predators. C. campbelli and C. petaurista had high association rates with C. diana monkeys, and fruit availability did not influence association rates. C. campbelli and C. petaurista used higher strata when in association with C. diana than when alone, but they used even higher strata when associated with other primates without C. diana. This suggested that C. diana competitively exclude C. campbelli and C. petaurista from higher strata. There were relatively large numbers of potential predators, and C. diana were usually the first callers to threatening stimuli, suggesting that antipredator benefits of association with C. diana outweighed the competitive costs. C. campbelli spent more time in association with C. diana than C. petaurista did and appeared to be more reliant on C. diana for antipredator benefits. C. petaurista were less reliant on C. diana because of a cryptic strategy and may have associated less in some months because of high chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) presence. © 2010 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.},

abstract={To understand the effects of environmental factors on a social system with multilevel society in proboscis monkey units, the temporal change of the local density of sleeping sites of monkeys was investigated along the Menanggul river from May 2005 to 2006 in Malaysia. Proboscis monkeys typically return to riverside trees for night sleeping. The sleeping site locations of a one-male unit (BE-unit) were recorded and the locations of other one-male and all-male units within 500 m of the BE-unit were verified. In addition, environmental factors (food availability, the water level of the river, and the river width) and copulation frequency of BE-unit were recorded. From the analyses of the distance from the BE-unit to the nearest neighbor unit, no spatial clumping of the sleeping sites of monkey units on a smaller scale was detected. The results of a Bayesian analysis suggest that the conditional local density around the BE-unit can be predicted by the spatial heterogeneity along the river and by the temporal change of food availability, that is, the local density of monkey units might increase due to better sleeping sites with regard to predator attacks and clumped food sources; proboscis monkeys might not exhibit high-level social organization previously reported. In addition, this study shows the importance of data analysis that considers the effects of temporal autocorrelation, because the daily measurements of longitudinal data on monkeys are not independent of each other. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Predation risk does not necessarily increase predation rates because prey may be able to behave differentially to cope with higher predation risk. However, antipredatory behaviors may be costly, leading to negative, although non-lethal, effects of predators on prey. We examined in outdoor enclosures whether an experimental increase in predation pressure, which did not increase direct mortality, but forced individuals to increase antipredatory behaviors, may have significant non-lethal effects on body growth and health state of juvenile lizards, Psammodromus algirus. Simulated persistent predator attacks resulted in slower rates of body size growth and body mass gain of juvenile lizards, which may greatly affect their future survival. However, juvenile lizards were able to maintain their initial body condition and immune response regardless of predation risk level. Moreover, our data suggested that experience of lizards with their home range "environment" might allow them to compensate the negative effects of temporal high predation risk on body condition when predation risk subsequently decreased. Finally, juvenile lizards with greater immune responses showed smaller increments in body size, but larger increments in body mass and body condition, at the end of the control treatment. In contrast, there was no relationship between immunity and growth after the experimental treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Climate change and habitat destruction are widely recognized as major threats to species' survival. As a result of these anthropogenic impacts, species are often forced into novel landscapes where their persistence is difficult to predict. Knowledge of how individuals move or disperse through the landscape, choose habitat in which to settle, and produce offspring which survive to repeat the process can greatly improve our ability to predict species' persistence. The field of behavioral landscape ecology uses a strong theoretical base to explore, often experimentally, how the behavior of a particular species is affected by heterogeneous and rapidly changing landscapes and can offer valuable insight for managing species in the face of human-induced environmental changes. When interpreted by modelers, results of landscape-level behavioral experiments can be quantified for use in predictive models. To this end, we summarize the methods and results of research using direct experimental manipulation techniques broken into the following categories: translocations, playback experiments, food resource manipulations, manipulations of reproductive success, direct manipulations of the landscape, and manipulations of predation risk. We review and place in a theoretical framework the results from this emerging body of research regarding how organisms move in and respond to different types of landscapes, both natural and human-altered. We go onto highlight the potential of each experimental method to quantify different processes, which may be useful when interpreted by modelers attempting to parameterize predictive models. Finally, we suggest future directions for experimental research that will allow for greater integration of behavioral landscape ecology and predictive modeling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Learning is a ubiquitous phenomenon in foraging animals, allowing behavioural optimisation in variable environments. Food imprinting is a specific form of learning restricted to the early stages of life and with long lasting consequences. However, since coining of the term four decades ago, the uniqueness of food imprinting has been largely questioned due to a putative mechanistic similarity with associative learning. Here, we demonstrate food imprinting in the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus, which primarily feeds on spider mites but may use thrips as alternative prey. Brief (24 h) exposure to thrips (contact without feeding) early in life resulted in shorter attack latencies and consistently higher predation rates on thrips during adulthood. Predation and oviposition rates were positively correlated but oviposition did not differ between naïve and experienced females. Our results suggest that food imprinting is indeed special because, unlike associative learning, it occurred without reinforcement, was restricted to a sensitive phase and persisted into adulthood. Food imprinting seems particularly advantageous when prey species availability varies little within generations and a given prey is difficult to ingest for young small but not older larger life stages. Food imprintability could be used to improve the efficacy of biocontrol agents such as N. californicus. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract={Background & aims: To consider the hypothesis that addiction to food, or more specifically sucrose, plays a role in obesity and eating disorders. Methods: By considering the relevant literature a series of predictions were examined, derived from the hypothesis that addiction to sucrose consumption can develop. Fasting should increase food cravings, predominantly for sweet items; cravings should occur after an overnight fast; the obese should find sweetness particularly attractive; a high-sugar consumption should predispose to obesity. More specifically predictions based on the hypothesis that addiction to sugar is central to bingeing disorders were developed. Dieting should predate the development of bingeing; dietary style rather than psychological, social and economic factors should be predispose to eating disorders; sweet items should be preferentially consumed while bingeing; opioid antagonists should cause withdrawal symptoms; bingeing should develop at a younger age when there is a greater preference for sweetness. Results: The above predications have in common that on no occasion was the behaviour predicted by an animal model of sucrose addiction supported by human studies. Conclusion: There is no support from the human literature for the hypothesis that sucrose may be physically addictive or that addiction to sugar plays a role in eating disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract={Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of participation in a cardiovascular screening program and of dietary counseling on self-reported psychosocial outcomes and health concerns. Methods: High-risk subjects (n=563) with hyperlipidemia from the Oslo Diet and Antismoking Study (1972-1977) were reexamined after 25 years and randomly assigned to a new 3-year prospective 2×2 factorial placebo-controlled study in 1997 of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and/or dietary counseling.Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Life Satisfaction Index (LSI), and a new questionnaire on health concerns and behavior in response to risk information were collected at the 25-year follow-up. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and LSI were evaluated at the end of the 3-year Diet and Omega-3 Intervention Trial on atherosclerosis (DOIT) in 505 subjects. Results: Twenty-five years after the screening program, HADS-anxiety was similar to the Norwegian norms (3.3 vs. 3.5), while HADS-depression was significantly lower (3.6 vs. 4.1, P<.01). Patients reported that 25 years of awareness of hyperlipidemia had influenced health concerns through a moderate change in diet habits, some restriction in life conduct, but an improvement of the total life situation.After a novel 3-year intervention in DOIT, there was no difference between the dietary counseling and control group with regard to anxiety, depression, or life satisfaction, but HADS-anxiety increased significantly (4.0 vs. 3.3, P<.001) in both groups. Conclusion: Compared to the general population, screening-positive subjects did not have increased mental distress 25 years after screening, and beneficial health behavior persisted. Dietary counseling did not affect psychosocial outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Adverse prenatal environment, such as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), increases the risk for negative neurobehavioral outcomes. IUGR, affecting approximately 10% of all US infants, is a known risk factor for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia spectrum disorders and addiction. Mouse dams were fed a protein deficient (8.5% protein) or isocaloric control (18% protein) diet through pregnancy and lactation (a well validated rodent model of IUGR). Dopamine-related gene expression, dopamine content and behavior were examined in adult offspring. IUGR offspring have six to eightfold over-expression of dopamine (DA)-related genes (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter) in brain regions related to reward processing (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex (PFC)) and homeostatic control (hypothalamus), as well as increased number of TH-ir neurons in the VTA and increased dopamine in the PFC. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (Cdkn1c) is critical for dopaminergic neuron development. Methylation of the promoter region of Cdkn1c was decreased by half and there was a resultant two to sevenfold increase in Cdkn1c mRNA expression across brain regions. IUGR animals demonstrated alterations in dopamine-dependent behaviors, including altered reward-processing, hyperactivity and exaggerated locomotor response to cocaine. These data describe significant dopamine-related molecular and behavioral abnormalities in a mouse model of IUGR. This animal model, with both face validity (behavior) and construct validity (link to IUGR and dopamine dysfunction) may prove useful in identifying underlying mechanisms linking IUGR and adverse neurobehavioral outcomes such as ADHD. © 2010 IBRO.},

abstract={We investigated operant behavior in a novel species, the dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli). In two experiments, hamsters were trained to lever-press for food reinforcement. In Experiment 1, rate of reinforcement was manipulated across conditions using four variable-interval schedules of reinforcement (delivering one to eight reinforcers per min). As predicted, within-session decreases in responding were steepest on the richest schedule. In Experiment 2, lever-pressing was reinforced by either a constant or a variety of flavored food pellets. Within-session decreases in responding were steeper when the reinforcer flavor remained constant than when it was varied within the session. In both experiments, subjects hoarded most reinforcers in their cheek pouches rather than consuming them in the operant chambers. These results are incompatible with post-ingestive satiety variables as explanations for within-session decreases in operant responding and suggest that habituation to repeatedly presented reinforcers best accounts for subjects' response patterns. Additionally, a mathematical model that describes behavior undergoing habituation also described the present results, thus strengthening the conclusion that habituation mediates the reinforcing efficacy of food. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The existence of a relationship between cortisol levels, after an acute stress, and behavioral activities, immunological profile, and production performance in sheep was studied. An initial flock of 30 Comisana ewes was involved in the experiment, and each of the 30 ewes was individually subjected to an isolation test in a novel environment. Subsequently, from the initial flock, 2 groups of 8 Comisana ewes were each retrospectively selected, and the animals were divided, according to their cortisol concentration 10min after the isolation test, into high cortisol (HC) ewes, having a peak of cortisol concentration &gt;90 ng/mL (average: 119.3 ng/mL ± 11.8), and low cortisol (LC) ewes having a peak of cortisol concentration &lt;80 ng/mL (average: 52.4±11.8). During the isolation test, the behavior of each animal was video-recorded and behavioral activities were registered. Blood samples were collected before the isolation test, immediately after the test (10min), and at 60, 120, 300min, 24h, and 48h after the test to evaluate percentages of T-helper (CD4+) and T-cytotoxic (CD8+) cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and IL-1β and IL-6 levels. The ewes were milked for 3 d after the isolation test to determine cortisol levels and IL-1β and IL-6 concentrations in whey. Milk yield was recorded at each milking, and milk samples were analyzed for pH, nutritional parameters, renneting properties, and somatic cell count. During the isolation test, HC ewes exhibited a shorter duration of movement and fewer bleats than LC ewes. The average plasma IL-1β concentration was higher in HC than in LC ewes. The average whey IL-1β and IL-6 concentrations were higher in whey from HC ewes than in LC ewes. A positive correlation emerged between plasma and whey IL-1β concentrations. The average CD4+/CD8+ ratio in blood was lower in HC than in LC ewes. Time from isolation affected the CD4+/CD8+ ratio: at 120min, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio increased compared with that at 10min after isolation and then decreased until 300min after isolation. On average, ewes with low cortisol concentrations showed higher milk production and lower SCC than ewes with high cortisol concentrations. Results suggest that plasma cortisol concentration is connected to the behavioral response and immune competence of dairy ewes and cytokine concentrations. Both whey IL-1β and IL-6 can be considered reliable indicators of the magnitude of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. The stress-induced changes in CD4+/CD8+ ratio are critical for controlling disease incidence and planning appropriate vaccination programs. High reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also associated with a reduction in milk production and an increased predisposition to develop intramammary inflammatory processes. © 2010 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract={Aim. Post-menopause is linked to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Physical exercise and healthy dietary habits are normally suggested to enhance health. The aim of this study was to verify whether the time of day of walking had different effects on both spontaneous dietary intake and body composition modification in overweight and sedentary post-menopausal women. Methods. Forty-two sedentary post-menopausal women (53.46±3.32 yrs) were recruited. Thirty-three completed the study: 29 were suitable for statistical analysis. Of those, 14 walked in the morning (MG) and 15 in the early evening (EG). Body composition, dietary habits and predicted VO2max were investigated. Food intake was analysed for energy, macronutrients and daily distribution. Results. The Mann-Whitney test showed that according to the time of day of walking there were different fat mass (FM) reductions and dietary behaviour responses. EG reduced FM greater than MG and showed a major increase in morning energy intake (EI). Sub-samples did not differ in total EI, daily macronutrient portioning and daily meals variations. The variation of FM was correlated with that of proteins (r=-0352), morning EI (r=-0.367) and aerobic performance (r=0.369). Both MG and EG improved their aerobic performance. Conclusion. The positive effects of walking on health could be optimised by its evening execution because it could also be linked to spontaneous dietary habit modification.},

abstract={In the present study, the effects of nitric oxide agents on WIN55, 212-2 induced state-dependent memory of passive avoidance task were examined in mice. One-trial step-down paradigm was used for the assessment of memory retention in adult male NMRI mice. Post-training intra-CA1 administration of CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists, WIN55, 212-2 (0.25, 0.5 and 1μg/mouse), dose-dependently decreased memory retrieval. The memory impairment induced by post-training administration of WIN55, 212-2 (1μg/mouse) was restored by pre-test administration of the same dose of the drug (1μsg/mouse, intra-CA1), showing the WIN55, 212-2 state-dependent memory. Single intra-CA1 administration of l-arginine (0.3, 1 and 3μg/mouse) or L-NAME (0.3, 1 and 3μg/mouse), 5. min pre-test could not alter memory retrieval. On the other hand, in the animals in which retrieval was impaired due to post-training administration of WIN55, 212-2 (1μg/mouse), pre-test intra-CA1 administration of l-arginine (1 and 3μg/mouse), but not L-NAME (0.3, 1 and 3μg/mouse) 24. h after training restored memory retrieval. Also, in the animals which received both post-training (1μg/mouse) and pre-test injections of WIN55, 212-2 (1μg/mouse), the injection of L-NAME (3μg/mouse, intra-CA1), 2. min before pre-test administration decreased retrieval. Furthermore, in the animals under the influence of post-training administration of WIN55, 212-2 (1μg/mouse), pre-test co-administration of non-effective doses of WIN55, 212-2 (0.25μg/mouse) and l-arginine (0.3 and 1μg/mouse), increased the restoration of memory by pre-test WIN55, 212-2.

abstract={The endocannabinoid system (ECS) consists of two receptors (CB1 and CB2), several endogenous ligands (primarily anandamide and 2-AG), and over a dozen ligand-metabolizing enzymes. The ECS regulates many aspects of embryological development and homeostasis, including neuroprotection and neural plasticity, immunity and inflammation, apoptosis and carcinogenesis, pain and emotional memory, and the focus of this review: hunger, feeding, and metabolism. This mini-review summarizes the main findings that supported the clinical use of CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists, the clinical concerns that have emerged, and the possible future of cannabinoid-based therapy of obesity and related diseases. The ECS controls energy balance and lipid metabolism centrally (in the hypothalamus and mesolimbic pathways) and peripherally (in adipocytes, liver, skeletal muscle and pancreatic islet cells), acting through numerous anorexigenic and orexigenic pathways. Obese people seem to display an increased endocannabinoid tone, driving CB1 receptor in a feed-forward dysfunction. Several CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists have been developed for the treatment of obesity. Although these drugs were found to be efficacious at reducing food intake as well as abdominal adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors, they resulted in adverse psychiatric effects that limited their use and finally led to the end of the clinical use of systemic CB1 ligands with significant inverse agonist activity for complicated obesity. However, the existence of alternatives such as CB1 partial agonists, neutral antagonists, antagonists restricted to the periphery, allosteric modulators and other potential targets within the ECS indicate that a cannabinoid-based therapy for the management of obesity and its associated cardiometabolic sequelae should remain open for consideration. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to explore interactions between coping style and diet as risk factors for developing insulin resistance in rats. We hypothesized that rats characterized by a passive coping strategy are more susceptible for developing insulin resistance and visceral obesity than proactively coping rats, particularly on a high (45%) fat diet. This hypothesis was tested by comparing 1) insulin and glucose responses to an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), and 2) body fat distribution, in two rat models for passive and proactive coping styles. We found that the most extremely passive rats are characterized by elevated insulin levels during a IVGTT, even on chow. Moderately passive rats display normal insulin responses under chow conditions, but develop insulin resistance on a high fat diet. Proactive rats are remarkably resistant to insulin resistance and visceral obesity, even when overfeeding on a high fat diet. Carcass analysis revealed that passive rats are characterized by increased epididymal fat deposition, which is in line with the observed differences in insulin resistance. We conclude that a passive personality is prone to develop insulin resistance and visceral obesity on a palatable fat diet and a proactive personality might be protected against the development of diet-induced insulin resistance. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents in Germany has doubled in less than two decades. In addition to familial risk factors and children's lifestyle, prenatal and postnatal factors modulate the long-term risk of obesity. The imprinting effects of metabolic variables during limited, sensitive time periods of prenatal and postnatal development on long-term health and disease risk is called early metabolic programming of long term health. The role of infant nutrition is supported by a reduced obesity risk in previously breastfed compared to formula fed subjects, documented in numerous studies and three meta-analyses. Breastfeeding might protect against later obesity by inducing lesser weight gain in infancy due to the lower protein content of human milk compared to infant formulas (the early protein hypothesis). We tested this hypothesis in the European Childhood Obesity Study, a double-blind randomized clinical trial enrolling 1,678 infants in 5 countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain). Reduced protein intake in infancy normalized growth achieved at 2 years of age relative to breastfed infants and the current WHO growth standard. The difference in weight gain up to 2 years old could reduce the prevalence of obesity in adolescence by some 13%. We conclude that infant feeding practice has a high potential for long-term health effects. The results obtained should stimulate the review of current recommendations and policies for infant formula composition. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract={Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neuropsychiatric degenerative condition with a fatal prognosis. It is caused by mutation - the expansion of CAG (containing cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats 40 and more at the short arm of 4th chromosome. The main clinical features are motor impairment (especially choreatic dyskinesias and the impairment of voluntary movements), progressive cognitive deterioration and personality changes. The product of the mutation is an aberrant protein known as huntingtin with an enlarged polyglutamine stretch. The prevalence of HD is approximately 1:10-15,000. The typical onset of HD is in the 4th decade with a minority of cases starting in childhood or adolescence (juvenile HD) or in patients over 65 years of age (late-onset of HD). The initial symptoms are usually non-specific: behavioural changes, personality and affective disorders. As HD progresses, cognitive disturbance appears, leading to severe dementia. Typical motor symptoms are choreatic and/or dystonic dyskinesias, the impairment of voluntary movements, gait disorder, dysfagia and dysarthria. The progression of HD leads inevitably to a marantic, cachectic state and loss of the ability to make voluntary movements, to ingest food, control of urination and defecation, etc. Therapeutic interventions can only target symptoms. The degree of choreatic dyskinesias may be alleviated by antipsychotics, risperidone or tiapride for preference, or by GABAergics (clonazepam) or depletors of dopamine (tetrabenazine). Marked improvement of dystonia may occur with amantadine. In juvenile forms of HD with akinetic syndrome it is possible cautiously to use L-DOPA or amantadine. Irritability and agresivity respond to antipsychotics, sertraline or valproate. Psychotic symptoms may be treated in accord with routine psychiatric protocoles. Adequate (hypercaloric) food intake is extremely important. Sipping or even percutaneous gastrotomy is often indicated in the advanced stages of HD. A multidisciplinary approach (neurology, genetics, psychiatry, speech therapy, physiotherapy and ergotherapy, dietetics, social support etc.) in HD is essential. Genetic testing confirms the clinical diagnosis. Adult and healthy people at risk may be able to request predictive genetical testing, but specific protocolary procedure is realized. Children and adolescents are not tested. Prenatal testing is also available. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis allows to give the birth of a healthy child without knowing of the genetical state of whichever parent at HD risk.},

abstract={A high genetic variation and recurrent changes in the genetic structure have been found in many pelagic populations. However, evidence that directly links these changes to differences in the ecological performance of particular genotypes is scarce. We hypothesized that within Daphnia, the specialization of clones occurring in a particular season to the food quality specific for that time of the year is responsible for the observed changes in the genetic structure of a population. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the fitness of spring and summer clones of the Daphnia longispina group, given food of biochemical quality relevant to these seasons. We identified significant intraspecific differences between clones of Daphnia that are specific for particular seasons, but there was no evidence that clones are adapted to the food quality available at the respective times of year. Summer clones reproduce at smaller size, and have a lower juvenile specific growth rate as compared to spring clones, irrespective of food quality. Spring clones invest more energy in somatic growth at the cost of reproduction, whereas summer clones invest more energy in reproduction at the cost of somatic growth. On the basis of the observed differences between spring and summer clones in their patterns of energy allocation, we suggest that other factors, most likely predation, are the major forces driving phenotypic and genetic diversity in the investigated Daphnia population of a large lake. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={Behavioural traits can strongly influence fitness and survival and are important mediators of life history trade-offs. This study explored the links between mortality trade-offs associated with fast growth during larval life and behaviour of individuals during an important life history transition. Longitudinal sampling of a cohort of damselfish settling on a reef at the end of their larval stage found that individuals with small otolith sizes at hatching and low otolith growth rates were selectively removed from the local population, while there was no apparent selection for size or body condition over the first 24 h after settlement. Selection against slow growth (initial larval growth and maximum growth) and small size at hatching and settlement were accentuated over the first month after settlement. Detailed behavioural assessments of naïve larvae settled onto habitat patches and monitored for 24 h found that initial boldness aided survival, but individuals that ventured larger distances from shelter suffered higher mortality. Correlations of growth with behavioural attributes were generally poor; however, there was a weak correlation between boldness and maximum growth. A measure of flexibility in the maximum distance ventured from shelter was positively related to initial otolith growth. Our results suggest that although early growth which is relatively slow leads to higher mortality later in life, and behavioural attributes influenced survival, there were only weak correlations between growth history and behaviour. This may be due to strong selective pressures on young fish to learn novel behaviours rapidly after settlement. Selection may promote behavioural flexibility at this key ecological transition. © Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract={We present an empirical analysis of the effects of incorporating novelty-based fitness (phenotypic behavioral diversity) into Genetic Programming with respect to training, test and generalization performance. Three novelty-based approaches are considered: novelty comparison against a finite archive of behavioral archetypes, novelty comparison against all previously seen behaviors, and a simple linear combination of the first method with a standard fitness measure. Performance is evaluated on the Santa Fe Trail, a well known GP benchmark selected for its deceptiveness and established generalization test procedures. Results are compared to a standard quality-based fitness function (count of food eaten). Ultimately, the quality style objective provided better overall performance, however, solutions identified under novelty based fitness functions generally provided much better test performance than their corresponding training performance. This is interpreted as representing a requirement for layered learning/ symbiosis when assuming novelty based fitness functions in order to more quickly achieve the integration of diverse behaviors into a single cohesive strategy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The expectancy of a rewarding outcome following actions and cues is coded by a network of brain structures including the orbitofrontal cortex. Thus far, predicted reward was considered to be coded by time-averaged spike rates of neurons. However, besides firing rate, the precise timing of action potentials in relation to ongoing oscillations in local field potentials is thought to be of importance for effective communication between brain areas. We performed multineuron and field potential recordings in orbitofrontal cortex of rats performing olfactory discrimination learning to study the temporal structure of coding predictive of outcome. After associative learning, field potentials were marked by theta oscillations, both in advance and during delivery of reward. Orbitofrontal neurons, especially those coding information about upcoming reward with their firing rate, phase locked to these oscillations in anticipation of reward. When established associations were reversed, phase locking collapsed in the anticipatory task phase, but returned when reward became predictable again after relearning. Behaviorally, the outcome anticipation phase was marked by licking responses, but the frequency of lick responses was dissociated from the strength of theta-band phase locking. The strength of theta-band phase locking by orbitofrontal neurons robustly follows the dynamics of associative learning as measured by behavior and correlates with the rat's current outcome expectancy. Theta-band phase locking may facilitate communication of outcome-related information between reward-related brain areas and offers a novel mechanism for coding value signals during reinforcement learning.

abstract={Food availability influences multiple stages of the breeding cycle of birds, and supplementary feeding has helped in its understanding. Most supplementation studies have reported advancements of laying, whilst others, albeit less numerous, have also demonstrated fitness benefits such as larger clutches, shorter incubation periods, and greater hatching success. Relatively few studies, however, have investigated the effects of supplementary feeding for protracted periods across multiple stages of the breeding cycle. These effects are important to understand since long-term food supplementation of birds is recommended in urban habitats and is used as a tool to increase reproductive output in endangered species. Here, we compare the breeding phenology and productivity of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major breeding in food-supplemented and non-supplemented blocks in a broadleaf woodland in central England over three seasons (2006-2008). Supplementation was provided continuously from several weeks pre-laying until hatching, and had multiple significant effects. Most notably, supplementation reduced brood size significantly in both species, by half a chick or more at hatching (after controlling for year and hatching date). Reduced brood sizes in supplemented pairs were driven by significantly smaller clutches in both species and, in blue tits, significantly lower hatching success. These are novel and concerning findings of food supplementation. As expected, supplementary feeding advanced laying and shortened incubation periods significantly in both species. We discuss the striking parallels between our findings and patterns in blue and great tit reproduction in urban habitats, and conclude that supplementary feeding may not always enhance the breeding productivity of birds. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Background: Obesity and phenotypic traits associated with this condition exhibit significant heritability in natural populations of most organisms. While a number of genes and genetic pathways have been implicated to play a role in obesity associated traits, the genetic architecture that underlies the natural variation in these traits is largely unknown. Here, we used 40 wild-derived inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster to quantify genetic variation in body weight, the content of three major metabolites (glycogen, triacylglycerol, and glycerol) associated with obesity, and metabolic rate in young flies. We chose these lines because they were previously screened for variation in whole-genome transcript abundance and in several adult life-history traits, including longevity, resistance to starvation stress, chill-coma recovery, mating behavior, and competitive fitness. This enabled us not only to identify candidate genes and transcriptional networks that might explain variation for energy metabolism traits, but also to investigate the genetic interrelationships among energy metabolism, behavioral, and life-history traits that have evolved in natural populations.Results: We found significant genetically based variation in all traits. Using a genome-wide association screen for single feature polymorphisms and quantitative trait transcripts, we identified 337, 211, 237, 553, and 152 novel candidate genes associated with body weight, glycogen content, triacylglycerol storage, glycerol levels, and metabolic rate, respectively. Weighted gene co-expression analyses grouped transcripts associated with each trait in significant modules of co-expressed genes and we interpreted these modules in terms of their gene enrichment based on Gene Ontology analysis. Comparison of gene co-expression modules for traits in this study with previously determined modules for life-history traits identified significant modular pleiotropy between glycogen content, body weight, competitive fitness, and starvation resistance.Conclusions: Combining a large phenotypic dataset with information on variation in genome wide transcriptional profiles has provided insight into the complex genetic architecture underlying natural variation in traits that have been associated with obesity. Our findings suggest that understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in metabolic traits in natural populations may require that we understand more fully the degree to which these traits are genetically correlated with other traits, especially those directly affecting fitness. © 2010 Jumbo-Lucioni et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Excessive physical activity plays an important role in the progression of anorexia nervosa (AN) by accelerating weight loss during dietary restriction. To search for mechanisms underlying this trait, a panel of mouse chromosome substitution strains derived from C57BL/6J and A/J strains was exposed to a scheduled feeding paradigm and to voluntary running wheel (RW) access. Here, we showed that A/J chromosomes 4, 12 and 13 contribute to the development of a disrupted RW activity in response to daily restricted feeding. This pattern is characterized by intense RW activity during the habitual rest phase and leads to accelerated body weight loss. Regions on mouse chromosomes 4, 12 and 13 display homology with regions on human chromosomes linked with anxiety and obsessionality in AN cohorts. Therefore, our data open new roads for interspecies genetic studies of AN and for unraveling novel mechanisms and potential effective treatment strategies for these neurobehavioral traits. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Low weight at birth is a common adverse developmental effect reported in human populations and animal toxicity studies. Epidemiological evidence links low birth weight to a syndrome of metabolic changes that increase later risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The present study used a four-treatment cross-over experimental design to evaluate the selective impact of early nutritional deficiency on metabolism and brain function across the lifespan of male Sprague Dawley rats. Undernutrition was induced prenatally by restricting maternal food intake to 50% of ad lib from GD3 to birth. Postnatal undernutrition was induced by fostering pups at birth to naïve dams in large (n=16) litters as opposed to small (n=8) control litters. Body weights were monitored in the early neonatal period, in early adulthood beginning at 5. months and through to senescence at 21. months of age. In contrast to recent reports, no increase in the prevalence of obesity was seen in animals born to food restricted dams and reared under ad lib feeding conditions. Behavioral tests of locomotion, learning and memory were performed in young, middle-aged, and aged animals. No effects of pre or postnatal nutritional history were detected. Age-dependent reductions in locomotor activity were detected, as well as deficits in spatial learning as measured in the Morris water maze and in context fear conditioning. These findings indicate that moderate fetal undernutrition followed by neonatal adequate nutrition does not appear to lead to obesity or neurological dysfunction in young adulthood or old age. © 2009.},

abstract={Individual common carp Cyprinus carpio were screened repeatedly for risk taking (rate of exploration of a novel, potentially dangerous environment) and for competitive ability (success in gaining access to a spatially restricted food source). Marked differences in behaviour were evident, and significant consistency in individual responses across trials was found for both risk taking and competitive ability. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between individual performance in these two contexts, with fish that explored more quickly in the novel environment tending to be among the first to gain access to restricted food. In two follow-up studies, resting metabolic rate, blood lactate and glucose and the expression of the cortisol receptor gene in the head kidney and brain were compared in fish from the two extremes of the risk-taking spectrum. Mass-specific metabolic rate was significantly higher in risk-taking than in risk-avoiding fish, while plasma lactate and glucose concentrations and expression of the cortisol receptor gene were lower. It was concluded that a behavioural syndrome based on boldness and aggression exists in C. carpio, as it does in many other animals, and that this is associated with differences in metabolic and stress physiology (down to the genomic level) similar to those described in animals with different coping strategies. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Environmental effects on sets of traits of organisms can have important consequences on populations. In marine species with complex life cycles, plastic responses in larval traits can affect size at metamorphosis and juvenile growth. These traits can ultimately affect survival and recruitment. Here, I evaluate links between pelagic conditions, natural variations in larval physiological traits (duration of development, size of the megalopa stage), size at metamorphosis, and juvenile growth in the shore crab Carcinus maenas. I sampled settling larvae (megalopae) of C. maenas, daily, during the settlement season of three consecutive years, in the island of Helgoland (North Sea, German Bight). Megalopae were brought to the laboratory where postmetamorphic growth was evaluated under different larval food environments. Traits varied considerably at several temporal scales; variation was not consistent among years. However, the size at metamorphosis was always larger at the start of the settlement season. Some variability correlated with predicted changes in transport processes and dynamics of plume fronts around the study area. Positive relationships between predicted periods of formation of plume fronts, settlement rates, and size at metamorphosis suggest a link between oceanographic conditions and individual traits. Size at metamorphosis explained juvenile growth rates: during the first five juvenile stages, larger individuals grew faster and reached larger size at stage (that is, at any stage observed). Megalopae experiencing ad libitum food conditions grew faster as juveniles than those deprived of food, showing that size at metamorphosis and juvenile growth respond plastically to variations in the larval food environment. I conclude that juvenile growth rate in C. maenas can be affected by natural environmental conditions experienced by larval stages; this effect is mediated by changes in the size at metamorphosis. Most likely the most important factor operating on the size at metamorphosis was food (availability/quality). Since juveniles of this species attain a refuge in size from cannibals, changes in size at metamorphosis could codetermine the chances of postsettlement survival. Further consideration of physiological traits and their consequences at the level of populations should lead to a better understanding of how pre-and postmetamorphic processes interact and explain variability in recruitment in species with complex life cycles. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Predation is a major selective force for many species, and the anti-predator strategies most effective for an individual are often shaped by its body condition. In a laboratory experiment, we investigate the influence of reproductive status on the locomotor performance and anti-predator behaviour of female funnel-web spiders Agelenopsis emertoni, both on and off their webs. In general, mated females were slower than unmated females, and a significant amount of variation in the locomotor performance of mated females was explained by their relative reproductive investment (egg case mass/female mass before mating). Regardless of whether they were on or off their webs, mated females were less likely to exhibit flight responses to simulated predator threats than were unmated females. When off their webs, mated females exhibited more aggressive anti-predator responses (i.e. display behaviour), but while on their webs they were more likely to exhibit crypsis or huddling anti-predator responses. Thus, shifts in anti-predator strategy might allow mated females to compensate behaviourally for their reduced locomotor performance. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Normal aging leads to an inexorable decline in motor performance, contributing to medical morbidity and decreased quality of life. While much has been discovered about genetic determinants of lifespan, less is known about modifiers of age-related behavioral decline and whether new gene targets may be found which extend vigorous activity, with or without extending lifespan. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we have developed a model of declining neuromuscular function and conducted a screen for increased behavioral activity in aged animals. In this model, behavioral function suffers from profound reductions in locomotory frequency, but coordination is strikingly preserved until very old age. By screening for enhancers of locomotion at advanced ages we identified the ras-related Rag GTPase raga-1 as a novel modifier of behavioral aging. raga-1 loss of function mutants showed vigorous swimming late in life. Genetic manipulations revealed that a gain of function raga-1 curtailed behavioral vitality and shortened lifespan, while a dominant negative raga-1 lengthened lifespan. Dietary restriction results indicated that a raga-1 mutant is relatively protected from the life-shortening effects of highly concentrated food, while RNAi experiments suggested that raga-1 acts in the highly conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway in C. elegans. Rag GTPases were recently shown to mediate nutrient-dependent activation of TOR. This is the first demonstration of their dramatic effects on behavior and aging. This work indicates that novel modulators of behavioral function can be identified in screens, with implications for future study of the clinical amelioration of age-related decline. © 2010 Schreiber et al.},

abstract={1. Social groups typically form due to delayed dispersal of adult offspring when no opportunities for independent breeding exist, or the costs of dispersal are higher than the costs of remaining philopatric. Ecological constraints are thought to be a main reason for group-living in animals. 2. Reproductive competition within groups can induce high costs of philopatry, and is thought to be a main reason for solitary living. 3. Experimental manipulation of reproductive competition is difficult. One solution is to compare sociality between periods with and without reproductive competition. 4. Here, we show empirically in a 8-year field study that striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) of both sexes were group-living during the breeding season when population density (PD) was high but solitary living when PD was low, supporting the ecological constraints model. 5. After the breeding season, in the absence of reproductive competition, the positive correlation between PD and percentage of group-living striped mice was absent. Almost all striped mice were group-living even under very low population densities. This supports the reproductive competition model. 6. Ambient temperature, food availability and predation pressure, did not influence sociality. 7. In captivity, the costs of reproductive competition in communal groups include female infanticide and aggression between females. 8. We conclude that group-living is favoured by constraints imposed through habitat saturation and by its benefits (improved thermoregulation by huddling, group-territoriality and predator avoidance), and that reproductive competition is a major force favouring solitary living in striped mice. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Feather pecking (FP) is a major welfare problem in laying hens, influenced by multiple factors. FP is thought to be redirected foraging behaviour, however fearful birds are also known to be more sensitive to develop FP. The relationship between fear-responses, foraging and FP is not well understood, therefore we studied the behaviour of 16 birds from a high feather pecking (HFP) line and 16 birds from a low feather pecking (LFP) line at 35 weeks of age inside a plus-maze. Birds were from the 10th generation of selection for either high or low FP. First exposure to the maze was used to measure birds' fear-responses to a novel barren environment. Hereafter, birds were trained three times in the maze with four different food-items that were offered in one of the four arms (i.e. regular food-pellets, feathers, grass, and mealworms hidden in wood-shavings). On the fifth day, birds were tested in the maze for 10 min during which they could choose to eat from all available food-items. When exposed for the first time in the maze HFP birds walked a longer distance, vocalized sooner and had more exploratory pecks compared to LFP birds who showed more wing-movements and defecations. When given a choice of food inside the maze both lines preferred eating worms, but HFP birds had more worm-eating bouts and ate faster than LFP birds. The results of this study indicate that HFP birds respond actively to fear-eliciting situations, which may originate from a proactive coping style. Instead of a clear preference for eating feathers, this study supports earlier findings that HFP birds have a stronger pecking motivation than LFP birds. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Changing dietary behavior is inherently difficult and even more so given the current obesity-promoting environment. Health professionals may facilitate this process for patients by assessing readiness to change, identifying personal priorities and barriers, and providing personalized knowledge, while increasing healthy-eating skills, motivation, and self-efficacy. It is also important to address the obesity-promoting environment through pubic policy as well as individual dietary change. Implementation of the American Heart Association diet and lifestyle recommendations is discussed along with barriers and recent assessment data. Patients may require assistance with interpretation of recommendations to their specific situations and practical application strategies considering their barriers and needs. One concept that may be helpful is a discussion that dietary change is not an end point but a process. Introducing patients to the 90-10 rule applied to food choices may help them conceptualize this process more easily. This idea revolves around the principle that what an individual does 90% of the time is most critical, and allowing some flexibility can make changing any lifestyle behavior more palatable and achievable.

abstract={There are numerous studies showing that predation risk may change different aspects of the behavior of prey, such as habitat use, activity pattern, and foraging. Prey should exhibit the strongest antipredatory response against their most deadly predator. Small mustelids are considered the most important mammalian predators of voles. Nevertheless, there is no general agreement as to whether strong antipredatory reactions exist in natural freeliving populations of voles. Here, we studied the field vole Microtus agrestis spatial reaction to high predation risk from small mustelids in the breeding (August) and nonbreeding (October) seasons under natural conditions. Voles were exposed to a caged weasel (Mustela nivalis) and a stoat (Mustela erminea), as well as to the odors of these predators. The reactions of 30 field voles were monitored with radiotelemetry. The field voles were found to display antipredator reactions that varied with season. In the breeding period, in response to predation risk, voles reduced locomotory activity and daily-range size, whereas in the nonbreeding period they did not. Changes in home range position were similar for control and treatment voles, in both the breeding and nonbreeding periods. The results indicate that mustelid predators modify the spatial behavior of small rodents in natural conditions depending on season. This might be a reflection of differences in state-dependent responses to predation from sexually active or inactive individuals. This suggests that the basic antipredatory reaction of voles under high predation risk from small mustelids limits their locomotory activity. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract={Essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3) are crucial to brain development and function, being relevant for behavioral performance. In the present study we examined the influence of dietary ω3 in the development of the glutamatergic system and on behavior parameters in rats. Female rats received isocaloric diets, either with ω3 (ω3 group) or a ω3 deficient diet (D group). In ontogeny experiments of their litters, hippocampal immunocontent of ionotropic NMDA and AMPA glutamatergic receptors subunits (NR2 A\B and GluR1, respectively) and the alpha isoform of the calcium-calmodulin protein kinase type II (αCaMKII) were evaluated. Additionally, hippocampal [3H]glutamate binding and uptake were assessed. Behavioral performance was evaluated when the litters were adult (60 days old), through the open-field, plus-maze, inhibitory avoidance and flinch-jump tasks. The D group showed decreased immunocontent of all proteins analyzed at 02 days of life (P2) in comparison with the ω3 group, although the difference disappeared at 21 days of life (except for αCaMKII, which content normalized at 60 days old). The same pattern was found for [3H]glutamate binding, whereas [3H]glutamate uptake was not affected. The D group also showed memory deficits in the inhibitory avoidance, increased in the exploratory pattern in open-field, and anxiety-like behavior in plus-maze. Taken together, our results suggest that dietary ω3 content is relevant for glutamatergic system development and for behavioral performance in adulthood. The putative correlation among the neurochemical and behavioral alterations caused by dietary ω3 deficiency is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Method: Eighteen pregnant C57BL/6j (22-25. g) mice were randomly divided into three groups of six each and fed with chow or high lipid diet composed of either flaxseed oil (chow diet 84%, cholesterol 0.2%, flaxseed oil 15.8%) or lard fat (chow diet 84%, cholesterol 0.2%, lard fat 15.8%). After weaning, the offspring were fed the same diet as their mothers were fed during the experiment, and their spatial memory and learning ability were evaluated by Morris water maze when they were 8 weeks old. Next, the blood and tissues were sampled when they were 9 weeks old. Serum lipids were determined using kits, and brain fatty acids were measured using a gas chromatograph. Results: Compared to chow diet (control), high flaxseed oil diet (HFO) increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol level (HDL-C) in the mothers but not in offspring; high lard fat diet (HLF) increased serum total cholesterol level (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol level (LDL-C) both in mothers and offspring. Brain fatty acids profile was altered by HLF compared with chow diet. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids content were significantly lower in the HLF group than in the control group, but saturated fatty acids content were significantly higher in HLF group than those in control group. The changed fatty acids composition affected the spatial memory and learning ability of adult offspring. Conclusions: A long-term high lard diet increased offspring serum TC and LDL-C levels and affected the brain's fatty acid composition, and memory and learning ability. The polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the brain may be correlated with serum cholesterol levels. © 2009 ISDN.},

abstract={Individuals with CHD are at increased risk of poor mental well-being. Dietary intake of EPA and DHA, the main n-3 fatty acids from fish, may be beneficial to mental well-being. We examined the association of EPA+DHA and fish intake with mental well-being in 644 participants, aged 60-80 years, with a history of myocardial infarction. Habitual food intake was assessed with a 203-item FFQ. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the self-report geriatric depression scale, and dispositional optimism was assessed with the revised life orientation test (LOT-R) and a four-item questionnaire (4Q). In Cox-regression models modified for cross-sectional analyses, we adjusted for sex, age, energy intake, BMI, family history of depression, education, marital status, smoking, physical activity and intake of saturated fat, alcohol and fibre. Compared with the lower tertile, subjects in the higher tertile of EPA+DHA intake had a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms, but this association was not statistically significant (prevalence ratio (PR) 078; 95% CI 050, 122, P-trend 027). The higher tertile of EPA+DHA intake was positively associated with dispositional optimism measured with the 4Q (PR 069; 95% CI 046, 103, P-trend 005), but not according to the LOT-R. Fish intake was not related to either depressive symptoms or dispositional optimism. In conclusion, intake of EPA+DHA was positively associated with dispositional optimism assessed with the 4Q, but not with optimism assessed with the LOT-R or with depressive symptoms. © 2009 The Authors.},

abstract={The best predictor of future misbehavior is a history of aberrant and wayward conduct. Even so, few theories attempt to account for time-stable maladaptive pathways. To this end, we advance a theory of stability, what we term Coherence Theory. Coherence Theory conceptualizes stability as an emergent property that occurs when antisocial dispositions, social consequences, and misconduct coalesce within an individual. In this sense, misconduct is viewed as only one component of a larger, overarching and multi-faceted emergent construct we label as "concentrated personal disadvantage." When these three components coalesce within an individual, temporal stability in maladaptive pathways should be expected. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the National Survey of Children, we test specific hypotheses derived from our theory. This study makes use of the first and second waves of survey data (N wave 1 = 2,301; N wave 2 = 1,423). The sample overall was 51% male and 52% white. Our analyses provide tentative support for the proposed theory. Concentrated personal disadvantage was found to emerge when the identified constellation of variables coalesced in individuals, and was found to be relatively stable over a 5 year period for males and females. Coherence Theory challenges traditional theories on the stability of antisocial pathways, offers specific conditions under which high levels of stability are likely, and explains why disruption off of antisocial pathways is so difficult. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Current knowledge suggests that patterns of energy storage and depletion in animals are governed by behavioural trade-offs between risks associated with feeding and future energy demands. However, the length of adverse periods varies over geographical or climatic gradients. To explore the potential for genotypic sources of variation in behavioural trade-offs, we compared the winter energy-depletion patterns among 13 wild populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) along a latitudinal gradient (58-70°N) and performed common-environment experiments of energy-state-dependent feeding. In the wild, winter lipid-depletion rates were lower for northern than for southern populations. The variation in spring lipid levels among the population was lower than autumn variation, with storage lipid levels clustered close to critical limits for survival. In semi-natural stream channels with natural food supply, hatchery-reared fish originating from northern populations showed a positive scaling of feeding activity with decreasing energy levels, whereas southern populations did not. In conclusion, juvenile Atlantic salmon from northern populations defend their energy levels more strongly than fish from southern populations. Adaptive variation in feeding activity appears important for this difference. Thus, the present study shows a link between geographical patterns in storage energy trajectories and adaptive differences in state-dependent feeding motivation. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={One of the big challenges for group-living animals is to find out who in a group has pertinent information (regarding food or predators) at any moment in time, because informed individuals may not be obviously recognizable to other group members. We found that individuals in human groups were capable of identifying those with information, and this identification increased group performance: the speed and accuracy of groups in reaching a target. Using video analysis we found how informed individuals might have been identified by other group members by means of inadvertent social cues (such as starting order, time spent following and group position). Furthermore, we were able to show that at least one of these cues, the group position of informed individuals, was indeed correlated with group performance. Our final experiment confirmed that leadership was even more efficient when the group members were given the identity of the leader. We discuss the effect of information status regarding the presence and identity of leaders on collective animal behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The large amount of discards produced by commercial fisheries can have major impacts on marine predator populations: this abundant food may increase populations of some scavengers or decrease others via accidental bycatch. Yet, despite the conservation implications of discard practices, the ecology of individual scavengers is poorly understood. Here, we assess the influence of commercial fisheries' activity on the foraging behaviour of individual breeding northern gannets Morus bassanus. Using recent developments in stable isotope mixing models (Stable Isotope Analysis in R or SIAR) we estimate individual discard consumption. Using GPS tracking and the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), we investigate behavioural responses to trawlers. Analysis of conventional diet samples, as well as stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in blood (plasma and cells), highlight marked individual differences in the proportion of fishery discards in the diet. Individual differences in foraging behaviour revealed by stable isotopes show evidence of both short-term consistency and behavioural flexibility. At-sea path tortuosity of 25 gannets (tracked using GPS loggers) revealed scale-dependent adjustments in response to VMS-derived fishing vessel locations, as well as to sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration and copepod abundance. The results also indicate individual variability in behavioural response to trawlers. Individual differences in the amount of discards estimated from SIAR were negatively correlated with differences in foraging trip length and body condition, indicating potential fitness consequences. Synthesis and applications. The management of commercial fisheries and apex predators is a daunting task. Ultimately, reducing bycatch and removing dependency on discards remain key conservation priorities, but managers should also ensure that scavenging species have sufficient alternative food to meet their energetic needs, to ameliorate potential unforeseen knock-on consequences. The results of Stable Isotope Analysis (SIAR) reveal intra-population differences in discard consumption by gannets; differences that have impacts on foraging effort and body condition. The use of GPS tracking and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) reveal that gannet at-sea behaviour is influenced by fishing vessels, although this also varies among individuals. A combination of SIAR, GPS tracking and VMS can be used to study fishery/scavenger interactions in detail at the individual level, to answer fundamental questions about scavenging behaviour. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={The increased recognition that the worldwide increase in incidence of obesity is due to a positive energy balance has lead to a focus on lifestyle choices that may contribute to excess energy intake, including the widespread belief that alcohol intake is a significant risk factor for development of obesity. This brief review examines this issue by contrasting short-term laboratory-based studies of the effects of alcohol on appetite and energy balance and longer-term epidemiological data exploring the relationship between alcohol intake and body weight. Current research clearly shows that energy consumed as alcohol is additive to that from other dietary sources, leading to short-term passive over-consumption of energy when alcohol is consumed. Indeed, alcohol consumed before or with meals tends to increase food intake, probably through enhancing the short-term rewarding effects of food. However, while these data might suggest that alcohol is a risk factor for obesity, epidemiological data suggests that moderate alcohol intake may protect against obesity, particularly in women. In contrast, higher intakes of alcohol in the absence of alcohol dependence may increase the risk of obesity, as may binge-drinking, however these effects may be secondary to personality and habitual beverage preferences. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The neurobiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains unclear. Dysfunctions of several neurobiological systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and other neurotransmitter systems, have been discussed. Here we present a theory that alterations in the sensitivity of opioid receptors or the availability of endogenous opioids constitute part of the underlying pathophysiology of BPD. The alarming symptoms and self-destructive behaviors of the affected patients may be explained by uncontrollable and unconscious attempts to stimulate their endogenous opioid system (EOS) and the dopaminergic reward system, regardless of the possible harmful consequences. Neurobiological findings that support this hypothesis are reviewed: Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent and risky sexual contacts, and attention-seeking behavior may be explained by attempts to make use of the rewarding effects of human attachment mediated by the EOS. Anhedonia and feelings of emptiness may be an expression of reduced activity of the EOS. Patients with BPD tend to abuse substances that target μ-opioid receptors. Self-injury, food restriction, aggressive behavior, and sensation seeking may be interpreted as desperate attempts to artificially set the body to survival mode in order to mobilize the last reserves of the EOS. BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance abuse, anorexia, self-injury, depersonalization, and sexual overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor antagonists. An understanding of the neurobiology of BPD may help in developing new treatments for patients with this severe disorder. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={For nearly all life forms, perceptual systems provide access to a host of environmental cues, including the availability of food and mates as well as the presence of disease and predators. Presumably, individuals use this information to assess the current and future states of the environment and to enact appropriate developmental, behavioral, and regulatory decisions. Recent work using the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has established that aging is subject to modulation through neurosensory systems and that this regulation is evolutionarily conserved. To date, sensory manipulations shown to impact Drosophila aging have involved general loss of function or manipulation of complex stimuli. We therefore know little about the specific inputs, sensors, or associated neural circuits that affect these life and death decisions. We find that a specialized population of olfactory neurons that express receptor Gr63a (a component of the olfactory receptor for gaseous phase CO2) affects fly lifespan and physiology. Gr63a loss of function leads to extended lifespan, increased fat deposition, and enhanced resistance to some (but not all) environmental stresses. Furthermore, we find that the reduced lifespan that accompanies exposure to odors from live yeast is dependent on Gr63a. Together these data implicate a specific sensory cue (CO2) and its associated receptor as having the ability to modulate fly lifespan and alter organism stress response and physiology. Because Gr63a is expressed in a well-defined population of neurons, future work may now be directed at dissecting more complex neurosensory and neuroendocrine circuits that modulate aging in Drosophila. © 2010 Poon et al.},

abstract={Young animals can learn about flavors from the maternal diet that appear in the amniotic fluid and mother's milk, which may reduce neophobia for similarly flavored food types at weaning. Flavor learning may be beneficial for piglets, which after the rather abrupt weaning in pig husbandry frequently show a period of anorexia, reduced health, and stress-induced behaviors. We investigated the effects of pre- and postnatal flavor exposure through the maternal diet on acceptance of a similarly flavored food and subsequent growth, health and behavior of newly weaned piglets.Sows were offered anise-flavored (F) or control (C) food during late gestation. Piglets were cross-fostered after birth, with each sow fostering 5 piglets from an F sow and 5 from a C sow. During lactation, sows were offered F or C food, resulting in FF, CF, FC and CC piglets. Piglets were weaned on day 25 and were given both control and flavored food for two weeks using a double food choice approach.The flavored food was not preferred. Yet, prenatally exposed animals showed a higher food intake and a higher body weight in the first days after weaning, and a lower occurrence of diarrhoea than non-exposed piglets. Prenatal exposure also increased the latency to fight, and reduced oral manipulation of pen mates and mounting during the first two weeks after weaning.Prenatal exposure, but not postnatal exposure alone, to anisic flavor through the maternal diet reduced weaning-associated problems in piglets and enhanced their health and welfare in the period after weaning. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Oviposition site selection is crucial for the reproductive success of a herbivore insect species with relatively sedentary larvae. The optimal oviposition theory, i.e., the preference-performance hypothesis, has thus far mainly been tested with a focus on nutritional quality of the host. This study investigates whether female oriental fruit moth Grapholita (Cydia) molesta choose a microhabitat for oviposition characterized by a temperature range within which their offspring perform best. Thermal preferences of females during oviposition were assessed in a circular temperature gradient arena. Offspring performance and survival were assessed under different constant temperature conditions. Females preferred oviposition sites of ∼30°C over lower and higher temperatures. At this temperature, egg, larval, and pupal development was significantly faster than at 22 and 25°C, and larval development was also faster than at 33°C. At 30°C and at the lower temperatures tested, survival of eggs and larvae was significantly higher than at 33°C, whereas development was precluded at 35°C. Furthermore, female pupal weight attained at 30 and 33°C exceeded that reached at the lower temperatures tested. Considering the potentially reduced predation risk caused by the shorter developmental time of eggs and larvae, the laboratory data suggest that this species maximizes its fitness by selecting a thermally optimal environment for its offspring, supporting the optimal oviposition theory. Conversely, it is known that the codling moth (C. pomonella) lacks a mechanism to avoid temperatures lethal to progeny development, which may reflect the differences in geographic ranges of these tortricids. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract={Recent research indicates that the orbital prefrontal cortex (PFo) represents stimulus valuations and that the amygdala updates these valuations. An exploration of how PFo and the amygdala interact could improve the understanding of both. PFo and the amygdala function cooperatively when monkeys choose objects associated with recently revalued foods. In other tasks, they function in opposition. PFo uses positive feedback to promote learning in object-reward reversal tasks, and PFo also promotes extinction learning. Amygdala function interferes with both kinds of learning. The amygdala underlies fearful responses to a rubber snake from the first exposure on, but PFo is necessary only after the initial exposure. The amygdala mediates an arousal response in anticipation of rewards, whereas PFo sometimes suppresses such arousal. A role for PFo in advanced cognition, for the amygdala in instinctive behavior, and for cortex-subcortex interactions in prioritizing behaviors provides one account for these findings. © 2010.},

abstract={This study presents a novel mathematical modeling framework that is uniquely suited to investigating the structure and dynamics of the sleep-wake regulatory network in the brain stem and hypothalamus. It is based on a population firing rate model formalism that is modified to explicitly include concentration levels of neurotransmitters released to postsynaptic populations. Using this framework, interactions among primary brain stem and hypothalamic neuronal nuclei involved in rat sleep-wake regulation are modeled. The model network captures realistic rat polyphasic sleep-wake behavior consisting of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. Network dynamics include a cyclic pattern of NREM sleep, REM sleep, and wake states that is disrupted by simulated variability of neurotransmitter release and external noise to the network. Explicit modeling of neurotransmitter concentrations allows for simulations of microinjections of neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists into a key wake-promoting population, the locus coeruleus (LC). Effects of these simulated microinjections on sleep-wake states are tracked and compared with experimental observations. Agonist/antagonist pairs, which are presumed to have opposing effects on LC activity, do not generally induce opposing effects on sleep-wake patterning because of multiple mechanisms for LC activation in the network. Also, different agents, which are presumed to have parallel effects on LC activity, do not induce parallel effects on sleep-wake patterning because of differences in the state dependence or independence of agonist and antagonist action. These simulation results highlight the utility of formal mathematical modeling for constraining conceptual models of the sleep-wake regulatory network.

abstract={Electrophysiological evidence in macaque monkeys indicates that when the monkey views a visual scene with objects present in both visual hemifields, the cells of the temporal lobe respond to objects in the contralateral field, but are hardly affected by objects in the ipsilateral field. If visual memories are stored in the temporal lobes, as is generally believed, then this implies that the transfer of visual object memories from one hemifield to the other should either fail or at least suffer decrement. Building on a previous study in human subjects, we tested this prediction in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We developed a method for tracking the eye movements of the awake, behaving monkey, which does not require the monkey to be restrained or surgically prepared. We optimised the system to provide reliable feedback of eye position in real time, and so provide hemifield-specific presentation of visual objects. In each acquisition phase the monkeys learned several object discriminations concurrently, each object only ever being presented to one hemifield, and with an object present in each hemifield on every trial. In subsequent transfer tests with the same objects, the monkeys performed significantly worse when the objects were shifted to the opposite hemifield than if shifted the same distance within one hemifield. Thus, in monkeys as well as in humans, and in association learning as well as in recognition memory, visual memories can be to a large extent hemifield-specific. This result shows that, like perceptual systems, mnemonic systems of the temporal lobe are largely hemifield-specific, and this has clear implications for studies of the temporal lobes. Further, the validation of our method will allow us to use it, in future experiments, to investigate in monkeys the effects of specific unilateral lesions on visual perception and memory for objects that are presented in known positions in the visual field. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: Suicidal behavior can be regarded as the consequence of the co-occurence of a personality characteristic underlying vulnerability and of state-dependent psychiatric problems. Further research has shown that personality characteristics including impulsivity and a disturbed regulation of anxiety or aggression may represent risk factors for suicidal behavior. The purpose of this study was to report relationship between attempted suicide and Cloninger's personality dimensions of temperament and character in psychiatric patients. Method: The sample of the study consisted of a sample of 365 female and 179 male adult psychiatric patients, 20.6% (n=112) of whom had recently attempted suicide. Findings: Novelty seeking was a highly significant predictor with high scores observed in patients with and low scores in patients without attempted suicide. Low self-directedness scores were also a substantial predictor of the presence of attempted suicide. Discussion: Temperament dimension novelty seeking appears pertinent to explore suicidality and measurement of character dimensions may be useful in the clinical evaluation of suicide risk.},

abstract={Early-life events influence late life health. An adverse early environment changes the developing organism's metabolism, physiology, and organ structure to increase risk of adult metabolic disorders, including the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Early environmental cues initiate functionally coherent adjustments that alter energy-partitioning and modify nutritional requirements. When maternal nutritional and endocrine cues predict future environmental conditions, developmental and metabolic responses to these cues could provide a mechanism for fine-tuning responses to local environmental conditions. However, individuals faced with scarcity early in life are now increasingly confronted with abundance later in life, and the resulting mismatch between the environment early and late in life is an important contributor to patterns of human morbidity and mortality. © Oxford University Press 2008.

abstract={Personality disorders are oftentimes comorbid with eating disorders. According to a review of the literature, obsessive- compulsive personality disorder is the most common Axis II disorder in eating-disordered individuals with restrictive eating behavior, whereas borderline personality disorder is the most common Axis II disorder in those with impulsive eating pathology. Because personality disorders developmentally precede eating disorders and the characteristics of the personality disorder oftentimes mirror the style of eating pathology (eg, highly controlled personality styles and highly controlled eating patterns; impulsive personality styles and impulsive eating pathology), it is reasonable to assume that personality disorders influence subsequent eating pathology. Therefore, it is likely that personality disorders function, to some degree, as risk factors for the development of specific types of eating disorders.

abstract={Learned changes in behavior can be elicited by either appetitive or aversive reinforcers. It is, however, not clear whether the two types of motivation, (approaching appetitive stimuli and avoiding aversive stimuli) drive learning in the same or different ways, nor is their interaction understood in situations where the two types are combined in a single experiment. To investigate this question we have developed a novel learning paradigm for Mongolian gerbils, which not only allows rewards and punishments to be presented in isolation or in combination with each other, but also can use these opposite reinforcers to drive the same learned behavior. Specifically, we studied learning of tone-conditioned hurdle crossing in a shuttle box driven by either an appetitive reinforcer (brain stimulation reward) or an aversive reinforcer (electrical footshock), or by a combination of both. Combination of the two reinforcers potentiated speed of acquisition, led to maximum possible performance, and delayed extinction as compared to either reinforcer alone. Additional experiments, using partial reinforcement protocols and experiments in which one of the reinforcers was omitted after the animals had been previously trained with the combination of both reinforcers, indicated that appetitive and aversive reinforcers operated together but acted in different ways: in this particular experimental context, punishment appeared to be more effective for initial acquisition and reward more effective to maintain a high level of conditioned responses (CRs). The results imply that learning mechanisms in problem solving were maximally effective when the initial punishment of mistakes was combined with the subsequent rewarding of correct performance. © 2010 IBRO.},

abstract={Background: Psychoactive medications, such as antidepressants, are one of the most widely prescribed categories of drugs in the US; yet few studies have comprehensively examined the conditions for which psychoactive medications are prescribed. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the extent to which psychoactive medications are prescribed for non-psychiatric somatic illnesses or the main types of psychiatric disorders for which psychoactive medications are being used. Objective: To examine the diagnoses for which psychiatric medications are being prescribed in the US by analysing data from a nationally representative survey of physicians. Methods: The data were obtained from the 2005 National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a continuing survey of a US office-based panel of physicians. The 2005 physician panel consisted of approximately 4000 physicians reporting quarterly, which was projected to a universe of 500 722 physicians. The study focused on the diagnoses that were given as the primary reason for prescribing the following types of psychotropic medications: antidepressants, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety medications. Results: Of the total number of antidepressant drug mentions, 92.7% were prescribed for psychiatric conditions. The most common (65.3%) were mood disorders (e.g. depression), followed by anxiety disorders (16.4%), which together comprised 81.7% of all antidepressant drug mentions. Of the total number of anti-anxiety drug mentions, 67.7% were prescribed for psychiatric conditions. The most common diagnosis was anxiety disorders (comprising 39.6% of all drug mentions), followed by mood disorders (comprising 18.9% of all drug mentions). Almost one-third of anxiety medication drug mentions were for non-psychiatric conditions or conditions of unspecified type. Of the total number of antipsychotic drug mentions, 98.9% were prescribed for psychiatric conditions. The most common diagnoses, comprising 39.0% of all drug mentions, were mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. The second most common psychiatric diagnosis was schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, comprising 34.5% of drug mentions. Approximately 7.4% of drug mentions were for delirium, dementia, amnestic or other cognitive disorders. Attention-deficit/ conduct/disruptive behaviour disorders were the diagnoses indicated on 5.7% of all antipsychotic drug mentions. Anxiety disorders were indicated on 5.5% of antipsychotic drug mentions. Disorders usually diagnosed in infancy/childhood/ adolescence (e.g. autism) comprised 2.3% of antipsychotic drug mentions. Conclusions: This research provides a broad view of the nature of psychoactive medication prescribing, which may serve as a guide to future research, policy and education about these medications, their perceived benefits and risks, and their uses. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract={Background: Strategies to enable older people to remain in their own homes require information on potential intervention areas and target groups for health promotion and healthcare services. Objective: this study aimed to identify socioeconomic, health and lifestyle factors in entry to residential aged care facilities. Design: a prospective cohort study was conducted from 1994 to 2005. Setting: the information source was the Melbourne Longitudinal Studies on Healthy Ageing Program. Subjects: one thousand Australians aged 65 years and over living in the community were used as baseline sample. Methods: socio-medical data were gathered in face-to-face baseline interviews, and outcomes were identified in biennial followups with respondents, informants and death registries over 12 years. Cox regression models identified baseline predictors of subsequent entry to residential aged care for men and women from among socio-demographic, health status and lifestyle factors. Results: the most significant factors were older age, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) dependence, cognitive impairment, underweight body mass index (BMI) and low social activity. For men only, the number of medical conditions and healthy nutrition score also emerged as significant. For women only, never having been married, IADL dependence and low BMI also were significant. For men, the risk of entry to residential aged care facilities was associated mainly with disease burden, whereas for women, social vulnerability and functional capacities were more important. Healthy lifestyles were important indirectly insofar as they influenced subjects' health status. Conclusion: to facilitate older people to stay in the community, it is important to treat or ameliorate medical conditions, promote healthy lifestyles and consider gender-specific risks. © The Author 2010.

abstract={Childhood obesity is associated with increased risk of behavioral/ psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, poor learning, and attention deficient disorder. As the majority of women of child-bearing age are overweight or obese and consume a diet high in dietary fat, it is critical to examine the consequences of maternal overnutrition on the development of brain circuitry that regulates offspring behavior. Using a nonhuman primate model of diet-induced obesity, we found that maternal high-fat diet (HFD) consumption caused perturbations in the central serotonergic system of fetal offspring. In addition, female infants from HFD-fed mothers exhibited increased anxiety in response to threatening novel objects. These findings have important clinical implications as they demonstrate that exposure to maternal HFD consumption during gestation, independent of obesity, increases the risk of developing behavioral disorders such as anxiety.

abstract={Although the effects of grazing-induced savannah degradation on animal diversity are well documented, knowledge of how they affect space use or responding behaviour remains poor. In this study, we analysed space use of the spotted sand lizard (Pedioplanis l. lineoocellata) in degraded versus nondegraded habitats of southern Kalahari savannah habitats. Lizards were radio tracked, daily movement distances recorded and home range sizes calculated. In degraded Kalahari savannah habitats where plant diversity and perennial grass cover are low but shrub cover high, P. lineoocellata moves larger distances (40.88 ± 6.42 m versus 27.43 ± 5.08 m) and occupies larger home ranges (646.64 ± 244.84 m2 versus 209.15 ± 109.84 m2) than in nondegraded habitats (high plant diversity, high perennial grass cover and low shrub cover). We assume that this increase in daily movement distances and home range sizes is a behavioural plasticity to limited food resources in degraded savannah habitats. Although P. lineoocellata is able to adjust to resource-poor savannah habitats, the increase in the lizard's movement activities is likely to result in a higher predation risk. This is supported by the lower availability of protective vegetation i.e. perennial grass cover. Hence, we conclude that despite behavioural plasticity of P. lineoocellata, overgrazing has a severe negative impact on the space use of P. lineoocellata. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={Objective: Key biological factors that influence the development of depression are modified by diet. This study examined the extent to which the high-prevalence mental disorders are related to habitual diet in 1,046 women ages 20-93 years randomly selected from the population. Method: A diet quality score was derived from answers to a food frequency questionnaire, and a factor analysis identified habitual dietary patterns. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure psychological symptoms, and a structured clinical interview was used to assess current depressive and anxiety disorders. Results: After adjustments for age, socioeconomic status, education, and health behaviors, a "traditional" dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains was associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia and for anxiety disorders. A "western" diet of processed or fried foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer was associated with a higher GHQ-12 score. There was also an inverse association between diet quality score and GHQ-12 score that was not confounded by age, socioeconomic status, education, or other health behaviors. Conclusions: These results demonstrate an association between habitual diet quality and the high-prevalence mental disorders, although reverse causality and confounding cannot be ruled out as explanations. Further prospective studies are warranted.},

abstract={Populations of Western countries are severely deficient in omega-3 intake, both in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and the Long Chain derivatives (LC-n-3), Eicosa-Pentaenoic-Acid and Docosa-Hexaenoic-Acid. Omega-3 insufficiency is a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebral diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and induces a significant socioeconomic cost and a marked increase in patient/family burden. To date, preventive treatments and neuroprotective drugs identified in preclinical studies failed in clinical trials, in part because of an inability to tolerate drugs at neuroprotective concentrations. Therefore testing alternative protective strategies, such as functional foods/nutraceuticals, are of considerable interest. We have previously demonstrated that a single injection of ALA reduced ischemic damage by limiting glutamate-mediated neuronal death, whereas repeated injections displayed additive protective benefits as a result of increased neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurotrophin expression. Because intravenous injections are not a suitable long-term strategy in humans, the present study investigated the effect of ALA supplementation by an experimental diet containing rapeseed oil (RSO, a rich source of ALA) as the only source of lipids for stroke prevention. We tested several experimental diets which included 5, 10, and 20% RSO-enriched diet and feeding paradigms (fresh diet was provided once or twice a week for 4 or 6 weeks). Our results showed that ALA supplemented diets are more sensitive to lipid peroxidation than a regular chow diet. Because the diet affected feeding behavior and animal growth, we defined concrete guidelines to investigate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on neuropathology. Among the different sets of experiments, animals fed with 10% and 20% RSO-enriched diet displayed a reduced mortality rate, infarct size and increased probability of spontaneous reperfusion in the post-ischemic period. In addition, a drastic reduction of lipid peroxidation levels was observed in the ischemic brain of RSO-fed animals. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the potential of employing rapeseed oil as a functional food/nutraceutical aiding in stroke prevention and protection. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Optimal foraging theory has only been sporadically applied to nonhuman primates. The classical prey model, modified for patch choice, predicts a sliding "profitability threshold" for dropping patch types from the diet, preference for profitable foods, dietary niche breadth reduction as encounter rates increase, and that exploitation of a patch type is unrelated to its own abundance. We present results from a 1-year study testing these predictions with Himalayan langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) at Langtang National Park, Nepal. Behavioral data included continuous recording of feeding bouts and between-patch travel times. Encounter rates were estimated for 55 food types, which were analyzed for crude protein, lipid, free simple sugar, and fibers. Patch types were entered into the prey model algorithm for eight seasonal time periods and differing age-sex classes and nutritional currencies. Although the model consistently underestimated diet breadth, the majority of nonpredicted patch types represented rare foods. Profitability was positively related to annual/seasonal dietary contribution by organic matter estimates, whereas time estimates provided weaker relationships. Patch types utilized did not decrease with increasing encounter rates involving profitable foods, although low-ranking foods available yearround were taken predominantly when high-ranking foods were scarce. High-ranking foods were taken in close relation to encounter rates, while low-ranking foods were not. The utilization of an energetic currency generally resulted in closest conformation to model predictions, and it performed best when assumptions were most closely approximated. These results suggest that even simple models from foraging theory can provide a useful framework for the study of primate feeding behavior. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Fermentation of resistant starch might prolong satiety, and, therefore, positively affect behaviour and welfare of restrictedly-fed pigs. The impact of a potentially satiating diet likely depends on housing conditions, such as the availability of rooting material which may serve as a substrate for foraging behaviour. We investigated effects of resistant starch on behaviour of growing pigs in barren housing (B) or on straw bedding (S) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Thirty-two groups of eight pigs (approximately 25 kg) were assigned to either B- or S-housing, and to native, resistant (NS) or highly digestible pregelatinised starch (PS) in the diet. Pigs were fed at 2.5 times energy requirements for maintenance in two daily meals. Behaviour was recorded in week 3 for five 1-h periods using 2-min instantaneous scan sampling. On day 23, six pigs per group were relocated to respiration chambers. Activity over the 24-h cycle was scored in week 5 using 9-min instantaneous scan sampling. S-housed pigs on the PS-diet were more active over the 24-h cycle than S-housed pigs on the NS-diet, whereas effects of starch type on activity patterns were less obvious in B-housing (starch type × housing interaction, P = 0.05). In the morning, when fresh straw was supplied, behaviour was strongly affected by housing, whereas effects of dietary starch were most obvious around the second, afternoon, meal. S-housed pigs were more active, showed more exploration and less oral manipulation of pen mates and fixtures than B-housed pigs. The PS-diet resulted in more aggression over the day than the NS-diet in B-housed pigs, whereas levels of aggression were similar for S-housed pigs on both diets (starch type × housing interaction, P < 0.10). Before their second meal, NS-fed pigs showed less locomotion, aggression (P < 0.05) and manipulation of pen mates (P < 0.10) than PS-fed pigs, which likely reflects reduced restlessness due to enhanced inter-meal satiety in the NS-fed pigs. After the afternoon meal, NS-fed pigs showed less activity, exploration and manipulation of pen fixtures (P < 0.05) than PS-fed pigs. In conclusion, dietary resistant starch affected behaviour patterns of restrictedly-fed growing pigs. The decreased activity and reduced preprandial restlessness suggest that fermentable starch enhances interprandial satiety in pigs, and therefore may improve their welfare. Even though effects of resistant starch on activity levels were more obvious in enriched housing, the welfare benefits of fermentable starch may be more pronounced in barren housed pigs as these animals lack an outlet for their increased foraging motivation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Signals increase the fitness of a sender by altering the behaviour of receivers. For cooperative interactions biological market theory proposes that signalling strength may be linked to supply and demand. In this context, a recent laboratory experiment demonstrated that cleaner shrimps may advertise their service to client reef fish and that the advertisement is linked to hunger levels. We investigated signalling by the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes longicarpus in the field to test more detailed predictions of biological market theory. Shrimps often clapped with their pair of claws in response to approaching clients. In line with both theory and the previous study, the probability of clapping increased when the shrimps had been food deprived and clapping shrimps were more likely to clean than nonclapping individuals. However, we found no evidence for the market theory prediction that signalling was targeted specifically to visiting client species with the option to choose other cleaning stations. Instead, shrimps signalled more frequently towards predatory clients than towards nonpredatory clients. We conclude that the signal does not serve primarily to attract the choosy clients but to convey information about identity as preconflict management to avoid predation. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Beginning with George Williams's concept of present and residual (future) reproductive value, life-history theory has considered that the optimized level of parental investment (i.e., assumed risk) should increase in proportion to the annual mortality rate of parent individuals. However, when the survival of young from independence to maturity is separated from parental reproductive success, optimized parental investment is proportional, instead, to prereproductive survival when reproductive and nonreproductive components of adult mortality are additive (simultaneous risk) or to the ratio of prereproductive survival to adult nonreproductive survival when the adult mortality components are multiplicative (independent risk). Applied to the lower, and largely nonoverlapping, brood sizes of tropical compared to temperate and boreal birds, estimates of both adult and prereproductive survival do not predict different levels of reproductive investment. Accordingly, the pervasive increase in clutch size with latitude would appear to reflect increasing availability of food resources to provision offspring. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Many studies with chronic stress, a common depression paradigm, lead to inconsistent behavioral results. We are introducing a new model of stress-induced anhedonia, which provides more reproducible induction and behavioral measuring of depressive-like phenotype in mice. First, a 4-week stress procedure induces anhedonia, defined by decreased sucrose preference, in the majority of but not all C57BL/6 mice. The remaining 30-50% non-anhedonic animals are used as an internal control for stress effects that are unrelated to anhedonia. Next, a modified sucrose test enables the detection of inter-individual differences in mice. Moreover, testing under dimmed lighting precludes behavioral artifacts caused by hyperlocomotion, a major confounding factor in stressed mice. Finally, moderation of the stress load increases the reproducibility of anhedonia induction, which otherwise is difficult to provide because of inter-batch variability in laboratory mice. We believe that our new mouse model overcomes some major difficulties in measuring behavior with chronic stress depression models. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Since 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological experiment in semiarid thorn scrub of a national park in north-central Chile. Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degus. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degus and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Niño events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Niños in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

abstract={The dramatic increase in obesity in western societies has shifted the emphasis in nutrition research from the problems of undernutrition to the adverse consequences of being overweight. As with humans, Old World monkeys are at increased risk for type II diabetes and other chronic diseases when they gain excessive weight. To prevent overweight and obesity, promote animal health, and provide a more natural level of fiber in the diet, the standard commercial monkey chow diet at a vervet monkey breeding colony was changed to a higher fiber formulation in 2004. The new diet was also higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate and energy density than the standard diet. Because maternal behavior is known to be sensitive to differences in resource availability, data on weight and mother-infant interactions for 147 mothers with 279 infants born from 2000 through 2006 were assessed for effects of the diet change. The results showed that, even though food was provided ad libitum, the mean body weight of breeding females was 10% lower after the transition to the high-fiber diet. Behaviorally, mothers on the high-fiber diet were significantly more rejecting to their infants, and their infants had to play a greater role in maintaining ventral contact in the first few months of their lives. The effects of the diet change on maternal rejection were significantly related to the mother's body weight, with lower-weight mothers scoring higher in maternal rejection. These results demonstrate that maternal behavior is responsive to changes in maternal condition, and that beneficial changes in the diet may have unintended consequences on behavior. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Behavioral syndromes are correlated suites of behavior, analogous to human personality traits. Most work to date has been taken from limited "snapshots" in space and time, with the implicit assumption that a behavioral syndrome is an invariant property, fixed by evolutionary constraints or adaptations. However, directional selection on two mechanistically independent traits (selective covariance) could also result in correlated behaviors. Previously, we have shown that shy/bold behavior in Southern dumpling squid (Euprymna tasmanica) across predator encounter and feeding risk contexts is genetically and phenotypically uncoupled, and hence potentially free to vary independently. Here, we collected data on shy/bold behaviors from two independent wild populations of squid in two different years to test whether behavioral correlations across these same two functional contexts vary through time and space. We detected significant influences of population, sex, and body size on the expression of boldness in squid within each functional context, and this was coupled with significant differences in relative population density and adult sex ratio. Despite these changes in behavior and demographic parameters, we found that correlations between boldness scores across the two functional contexts were largely absent in both wild populations of squid in both years. Our work suggests that some animal groups may be largely characterized by context-specific behavioral expression. A theoretical framework which conceptualizes behavioral syndromes resulting from context-specific behavioral rules may be needed to fully understand why behaviors are sometimes correlated, and why sometimes they are not. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Despite the multitude of work on patch time allocation and the huge number of studies on patch choice in the face of danger, the patch leaving response of foragers perceiving cues of danger has received relatively little attention. We investigated the response of parasitoid insects to cues of danger both theoretically and experimentally. Using stochastic dynamic theory, we demonstrate that patch-leaving responses in response to the detection of danger should be seen as a dynamic decision that depends upon reproductive options on the current host patch and on alternative patches that might be found after leaving the current patch. Our theory predicts a sigmoidal response curve of parasitoids, where they should accept the danger and stay on the patch when patch quality is high and should increasingly avoid the risk and emigrate from the patch with decreasing patch quality and decreasing costs of traveling to an alternative host patch. Experiments with females of the drosophilid parasitoid Asobara tabida that were exposed to a puff of formic acid (a danger cue) at different times through their patch exploitation confirmed the theoretical predictions (i. e., a sigmoid response curve); however, the predicted curve was significantly steeper than observed. We discuss the impact of dynamic patch-exit decisions of individual foragers on population and community dynamics. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Here we assessed whether variety-seeking, i.e. the tendency to look for diversity in services and goods, occurs in capuchin monkeys - South-American primates which - as humans - are omnivorous and susceptible to food monotony. Capuchins chose between a Variety-token, that allowed to select one among 10 different foods (one more-preferred and nine less-preferred) and a Monotony-token, that - upon exchange with the experimenter - either allowed to select one among 10 units of the same more-preferred food or gave access to one unit of the more-preferred food. To examine how food preference affects variety-seeking, in the B-condition we presented nine moderately preferred foods, whereas in the C-condition we presented nine low-preferred foods. Overall, capuchins preferred the Variety-token over the Monotony-token and often selected one of the less-preferred foods. These results suggest that variety-seeking is rooted in our evolutionary history, and that it satisfies the need of experiencing stimulation from the environment; at the ultimate level, variety-seeking may allow the organism to exploit novel foods and obtain a correct nutritional intake. Finally, variety-seeking could have contributed to the transition from barter to money in many human cultures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: We aimed to assess the pathway from personality to alexithymia through mood and anxiety as mediators. Method: Three hundred thirty-four subjects (130 male), whose psychiatric health was verified by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I disorders, completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the Temperament and Character Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). The schematic models for the pathway analysis from Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) to TAS-20 scores were made. Results: Low reward dependence (RD), low self-directedness (S-D), and high cooperativeness (CO) had paths to TAS-20 total (P = .000, P = .000, and P = .042, respectively). S-D had also an indirect path via STAI-state to TAS total. On TAS-20 factor 1, low RD, low S-D, and high self-transcendence (ST) had direct effects (P = .004, P = .000, and P = .000, respectively). S-D had also an indirect path via STAI-state and (CES-D) on TAS-20 factor 1. On TAS factor 2, low novelty seeking (NS), high harm avoidance (HA), low RD, low S-D, and high cooperativeness (CO) had direct effects (P = .005, P = .011, P = .000, P = .000, and P = .004, respectively). On TAS-20 factor 3, low RD and S-D had direct effects (P = .002 and P = .000, respectively). Conclusion: Current results suggest that although alexithymia is affected by the personality, state-dependent mood and anxiety may mediate the relationship between alexithymia and personality. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a combination of cardio-metabolic risk determinants, including central obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, and microalbuminuria. The prevalence of MetS is rapidly increasing worldwide, largely as a consequence of the ongoing obesity epidemic. Environmental factors during periods early in development have beenshownto influence the susceptibility to develop disease in later life. In particular, there is a wealth of evidence from both epidemiological and animal studies for greater incidence of features of MetS as a result of unbalanced maternal nutrition. The mechanisms by which nutritional insults during a period of developmental plasticity result in a MetS phenotype are now beginning to receive considerable scientific interest. This review focuses on recent data regarding these mechanisms, in particular the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of key metabolic genes in response to nutritional stimuli that mediate persistent changes and an adult MetS phenotype. A continued and greater understanding of these mechanisms will eventually allow specific interventions, with a favorable impact on the global incidence of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in the future. © 2010 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract={The concept of personal responsibility has been central to social, legal, and political approaches to obesity. It evokes language of blame, weakness, and vice and is a leading basis for inadequate government efforts, given the importance of environmental conditions in explaining high rates of obesity. These environmental conditions can override individual physical and psychological regulatory systems that might otherwise stand in the way of weight gain and obesity, hence undermining personal responsibility, narrowing choices, and eroding personal freedoms. Personal responsibility can be embraced as a value by placing priority on legislative and regulatory actions such as improving school nutrition, menu labeling, altering industry marketing practices, and even such controversial measures as the use of food taxes that create healthier defaults, thus supporting responsible behavior and bridging the divide between views based on individualistic versus collective responsibility. © 2010 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Proposals for wind farms in areas of known importance for breeding seabirds highlight the need to understand the impacts of these structures. Using an energetic modelling approach, we examine the effects of wind farms as barriers to movement on seabirds of differing morphology. Additional costs, expressed in relation to typical daily energetic expenditures, were highest per unit flight for seabirds with high wing loadings, such as cormorants. Taking species-specific differences into account, costs were relatively higher in terns, due to the high daily frequency of foraging flights. For all species, costs of extra flight to avoid a wind farm appear much less than those imposed by low food abundance or adverse weather, although such costs will be additive to these. We conclude that adopting a species-specific approach is essential when assessing the impacts of wind farms on breeding seabird populations, to fully anticipate the effects of avoidance flights. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Animal behaviour is a composite of innate and learned components. During their lifetimes, animals typically gain experience and manifest learning, thereby augmenting or modifying genetically determined, innate behaviour patterns. Following a training period during which predatory fish (jade perch, Scortum barcoo) were allocated to treatments and given experience of either live prey (mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki), freshly killed prey, or cichlid pellets with equal nutritional value, we tested the response of the predators to the prey in an experimental arena. Across all treatments, there was no difference in the number of attacks made by the predators on the prey, however the predators with experience of live fish prey were significantly more successful in capturing prey than those without previous experience of live prey. These results suggest that, in this piscivorous predator, the recognition of prey has an innate component, but that hunting efficiency is increased through experience. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the release of hatchery-reared fish into the wild, the majority of which are predatory. © 2009 Brill.},

Here, we report predation of great tits (Parus major) on hibernating pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) at a Hungarian cave. Over two winters, we directly observed 18 predation events. The tits specifically and systematically searched for and killed bats for food. A substantial decrease in predation on bats after experimental provisioning of food to the tits further supports the hypothesis that bat-killing serves a foraging purpose in times of food scarcity. We finally conducted a playback experiment to test whether tits would eavesdrop on calls of awakening bats to find them in rock crevices. The tits could clearly hear the callsandwere attracted to the loudspeaker. Records for tit predation on bats at this cave now span more than ten years and thus raise the question of whether cultural transmission plays a role for the spread of this foraging innovation. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Response delays to predator attack may be adaptive, suggesting that latency to respond does not always reflect predator detection time, but can be a decision based on starvation-predation risk trade-offs. In birds, some anti-predator behaviours have been shown to be correlated with personality traits such as activity level and exploration. Here, we tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species, juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Individual focal fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration of a novel environment. We found a strong positive correlation between exploration and time taken to respond to the predator model. Fish that were fast to explore the novel environment were slower to respond to the predator. Our study therefore provides some of the first experimental evidence for a link between exploration behaviour and predator-escape behaviour. We suggest that different behavioural types may differ in how they partition their attention between foraging and anti-predator vigilance. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Myg1 (Melanocyte proliferating gene 1) is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed gene, which encodes a protein with mitochondrial and nuclear localization. In the current study we demonstrate a gradual decline of Myg1 expression during the postnatal development of the mouse brain that suggests relevance for Myg1 in developmental processes. To study the effects of Myg1 loss-of-function, we created Myg1-deficient (-/-) mice by displacing the entire coding sequence of the gene. Initial phenotyping, covering a multitude of behavioural, cognitive, neurological, physiological and stress-related responses, revealed that homozygous Myg1 (-/-) mice are vital, fertile and display no gross abnormalities. Myg1 (-/-) mice showed an inconsistent pattern of altered anxiety-like behaviour in different tests. The plus-maze and social interaction tests revealed that male Myg1 (-/-) mice were significantly less anxious than their wild-type littermates; female (-/-) mice showed increased anxiety in the locomotor activity arena. Restraint-stress significantly reduced the expression of the Myg1 gene in the prefrontal cortex of female wild-type mice and restrained female (-/-) mice showed a blunted corticosterone response, suggesting involvement of Myg1 in stress-induced responses. The main finding of the present study was that Myg1 invalidation decreases several behavioural differences between male and female animals that were obvious in wild-type mice, indicating that Myg1 contributes to the expression of sex-dependent behavioural differences in mice. Taken together, we provide evidence for the involvement of Myg1 in anxiety- and stress-related responses and suggest that Myg1 contributes to the expression of sex-dependent behavioural differences. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Zebrafish has been gaining increasing amount of interest in behavioral neuroscience as this species may represent a good compromise between system complexity and practical simplicity. Particularly successful have been those studies that utilized zebrafish as a screening tool. Given the complexity of the mechanisms of learning, for example, forward genetic screens with zebrafish could potentially reveal previously unknown genes and molecular pathways that subserve this function. These screens, however, require appropriate phenotypical (e.g. behavioral) paradigms. A step in this direction is the characterization of learning abilities of zebrafish. Here we employ two classical learning tasks in a plus maze. In the first, zebrafish are required to associate a visible cue with food reward irrespective of the location of this pairing. In the second, zebrafish are required to associate the spatial location of food reward irrespective of intra-maze cues. Our results demonstrate that zebrafish perform well in both tasks and show significant acquisition of the association between cue and reward as well as between location and reward. We conclude that zebrafish, similar to classical laboratory rodents, may have utility in the biological analysis of simple as well as complex forms of associative learning. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Many organisms have evolved inducible defences in response to spatial and temporal variability in predation risk. These defences are assumed to incur large costs to prey; however, few studies have investigated the mechanisms and costs underlying these adaptive responses. I examined the proximate cause of predator-induced shell thickening in a marine snail (Nucella lamellosa) and tested whether induced thickening leads to an increase in structural strength. Results indicate that although predators (crabs) induce thicker shells, the response is a passive by-product of reduced feeding and somatic growth rather than an active physiological response to predation risk. Physical tests indicate that although the shells of predator-induced snails are significantly stronger, the increase in performance is no different than that of snails with limited access to food. Increased shell strength is attributable to an increase in the energetically inexpensive microstructural layer rather than to material property changes in the shell. This mechanism suggests that predator-induced shell defences may be neither energetically nor developmentally costly. Positive correlations between antipredator behaviour and morphological defences may explain commonly observed associations between growth reduction and defence production in other systems and could have implications for the evolutionary potential of these plastic traits. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Adolescence is associated with the development of brain regions linked to cognition and emotion. Such changes are thought to contribute to the behavioral and neuropsychiatric vulnerabilities of this period. We compared adolescent (Postnatal Days 28-42) and adult (Postnatal Day 60+) rats as they performed a simple instrumental task and extinction. Rats were trained to poke into a hole for a food-pellet reinforcer. After six days of training, rats underwent extinction sessions in which the previously rewarded behavior was no longer reinforced. During extinction, we examined the effects of continued presentation of a cue light and food restriction. Adults and adolescents exhibited similar performance during training, although adolescents made more task-irrelevant pokes, consistent with increased exploration. Adults made more premature pokes, which could indicate a more exclusive focus on the task. During extinction, adolescents made more perseverative (previously reinforced) pokes than adults. This behavior was strongly modulated by the combination of motivational factors present (food restriction and cue light), indicating that adolescents were differentially sensitive to them. Furthermore, food restriction induced greater open-field activity in adolescents but not in adults. Thus, as the neural circuitry of motivated behavior develops substantially during adolescence, so too does the behavioral sensitivity to motivational factors. Understanding how such factors differently affect adolescents may shed light on mechanisms that lead to the development of disorders that are manifested during this period. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={The detrimental impacts of invasive, non-native species on islands are widely acknowledged and it is often best to act rapidly against such species, even where uncertainty exists over the best way to proceed. If management actions are evaluated and refined, using information learnt from the biology of culled animals, this uncertainty can be gradually reduced, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. American mink Neovison vison carcasses were collected as part of an eradication campaign on several islands of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, and stable isotope analysis was used to describe ecological variation in this invasive non-native predator. Isotope profiles from individual mink whiskers demonstrated how behaviour at a population level changed markedly over time. As the eradication campaign progressed, mink increased their reliance on marine food sources and focused their activity on the coastline. Stable isotope analyses also demonstrated sex-related changes in foraging and ranging behaviour in relation to food resource availability on the two main island complexes. Synthesis and applications. Our findings contribute to the refinement of a campaign to extend the successful eradication of mink from Uist and Harris, to the whole of the Outer Hebrides archipelago, UK. They also highlight the potential for stable isotope approaches to provide more detailed postmortem information that can inform adaptive management of wildlife populations for conservation objectives. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={Rats with perirhinal cortex lesions were sequentially trained in a rectangular water tank on a series of 3 visual discriminations, each between mirror-imaged stimuli. When these same discriminations were tested concurrently, the rats were forced to use a configural strategy to solve the problems effectively. There was no evidence that lesions of the perirhinal cortex disrupted the ability to learn the concurrent configural discrimination task, which required the rats to learn the precise combination of stimulus identity with stimulus placement ("structural" learning). The same rats with perirhinal cortex lesions were also unimpaired on a test of spatial working memory (reinforced T maze alternation), although they were markedly impaired on a new test of spontaneous object recognition. For the recognition test, rats received multiple trials within a single session in which on every trial, they were allowed to explore 2 objects, 1 familiar, the other novel. On the basis of their differential exploration times, rats with perirhinal cortex lesions showed very poor discrimination of the novel objects, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the surgery. The discovery that bilateral lesions of the perirhinal cortex can leave configural (structural) learning seemingly unaffected points to a need to refine those models of perirhinal cortex function that emphasize its role in representing conjunctions of stimulus features. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Cannibalism is hypothesized to have evolved as a way to obtain a high-quality meal. We examined the extraction of lipid and protein by female wolf spiders, Hogna helluo, during sexual cannibalism of males and predation of crickets. Most food-limited females did not cannibalize males but immediately consumed a size-matched cricket. When consuming male H. helluo and crickets, female H. helluo only consumed 51% of the male body while they consumed 72% of the cricket body. While males had higher protein content in their bodies than crickets and other insects, female H. helluo ingested similar amounts of protein from male H. helluo and crickets. Female H. helluo extracted 47% of the protein present in male H. helluo and 67% of the protein present in crickets. Females were able to extract nearly all of the lipid present in male H. helluo and crickets. However, crickets and other insects had almost 4 times higher lipid content than male H. helluo. The ratio of lipid to protein consumed from crickets appeared more similar to the nutritional requirements of egg production than that of males. Taken together, female hesitancy to engage in cannibalism, low extraction of nutrients from males and a low ratio of lipid to protein in the food extracted from males suggest that males may be poor-quality prey items compared to common insects such as crickets. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Arctic charr are characterized by an extensive variability in growth and body size in natural waters. Although growth traits may involve a significant heritable component, most of this intraspecific variation presumably is environmentally induced and thus attributable to phenotypic plasticity. In the present study, size-at-age and length-weight relationship (body condition) were assessed for three Finnish Arctic charr populations of different geographical origins and extreme size forms (a stunted vs. two large-growing, predatory charr) held under standardized rearing conditions for 3 years (up to 37 months after hatching). In particular, our interest was to investigate whether the differences in growth between the large and the stunted charr as observed in the wild populations would diminish when the fish are offered suitable food in abundance. Population-specific mean body size and condition differed significantly in 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ fish. However, the identical rearing conditions resulted in the originally stunted charr reaching a comparable final mean size (317 mm/427 g) as the large charr populations (343 mm/510 g and 359 mm/497 g). Some individuals were of the same size as their parents at spawning already at the age of 0+ years. Furthermore, length-weight regression residuals of the stunted charr developed to a notably high level, indicating the largest final condition mean. The increase of size variation (CV of weight) in stunted charr lasted for over two growth seasons, whereas in large charr it remained stable since the end of the first summer. Variations in mortality and sexual maturation at age 2 seemed to be less relevant factors affecting overall growth performance. The study demonstrates an example of the high plasticity involved in the growth of fish: the stunted charr possess a tremendous capacity for growth in a benign environment, virtually corresponding to that observed in the large predatory populations. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Predator-prey interactions are usually composed of behaviorally sophisticated games in which the values of the strategies of foraging prey individuals may depend on those of their predators, and vice versa. Therefore, any change in the behavior of the predator should result in changes to the behavior of the prey. However, this key prediction has rarely been tested. To examine the effects of the predator state on prey behavior, we manipulated the state of captive Barn Owls, Tyto alba, and released them into an enclosure containing Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi, a common prey of the owls. The owls were significantly more active when hungry. In response, the gerbils altered their behavior according to the state of the owl. When the owl was hungry, the gerbils visited fewer food patches, foraged in fewer patches, and harvested less food from each patch. Moreover, the gerbils kept their foraging bouts closer to their burrow, which reduced the overlap among foraging ranges of individual gerbils. Thus, changes in the state of the predator affect the foraging behavior of its prey and can also mediate competition among prey individuals. © 2010 by the Ecological society of America.},

abstract={Caloric restriction (CR), primarily known for extending life span, has proven anticonvulsant in several seizure models and antiepileptogenic in a strain of inherently seizure susceptible mice. Our animal model consisted of a seizure-prone (Fast) strain that naturally exhibits attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors and a comparison seizure-resistant (Slow) strain; we evaluated CR's effect on the typical seizure sensitivities and behavioral profiles of each strain. Fast and Slow rats were fed ad libitum or were calorically restricted to 80% of free-feeding body weight. Rats were then tested in the open field (hyperactivity), Morris water maze (learning and attention), and restraint (impulsivity) paradigms and finally kindled from the amygdala. Ultimately, CR abolished signs of abnormal hyperactivity in the Fast strain and retarded their kindling rates, making it the first manipulation to demonstrate an antiepileptogenic effect in this animal model. CR also shortened seizure durations in fully kindled Slow rats but had no effect on their kindling rates, implying a differential effect of CR on genotype. These results clearly endorse further investigation into the potential benefits of CR for both epilepsy and ADHD. © 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={The serotonin transporter knockout (SERT-/-) mouse, generated in 1998, was followed by the SERT-/- rat, developed in 2006. The availability of SERT-/- rodents creates the unique possibility to study the conservation of gene function across species. Here we summarize SERT-/- mouse and rat data, and discuss species (dis)similarities in neurobehavioral endophenotypes. Both SERT-/- rodent models show a disturbed serotonergic system, altered nociception, higher anxiety, decreased social behavior, as well as increased negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition and decision making. Used to model a wide range of psychiatric disorders, SERT-/- rodents may be particularly valuable in research on neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and possibly autism. We conclude that SERT function is conserved across mice and rats and that their behavioral profile arises from common neurodevelopmental alterations. Because mice and rats have species-specific characteristics that confer differential research advantages, a comparison of the two models has heuristic value in understanding the mechanisms and behavioral outcome of SERT genetic variation in humans. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Most forms of visceral pain generate intense referred hyperalgesia but the mechanisms of this enhanced visceral hypersensitivity are not known. The on-cells of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play an important role in descending nociceptive facilitation and can be sensitized to somatic mechanical stimulation following peripheral nerve injury or hindpaw inflammation. Here we have tested the hypothesis that visceral noxious stimulation sensitizes RVM ON-like cells, thus promoting an enhanced descending facilitation that can lead to referred visceral hyperalgesia. Intracolonic capsaicin instillation (ICI) was applied to rats in order to create a hyperalgesic state dependent on noxious visceral stimulation. This instillation produced acute pain-related behaviors and prolonged referred hyperalgesia that were prevented by the RVM microinjection of AP5, an NMDA selective antagonist. In electrophysiological experiments, ON-like RVM neurons showed ongoing spontaneous activity following ICI that lasted for ∼ 20 min and an enhanced responsiveness to von Frey and heat stimulation of the hindpaw and to colorectal distention (CRD) that lasted for at least 50 min post capsaicin administration. Moreover, ON-like cells acquired a novel response to CRD and responded to heat stimulation in the innocuous range. OFF-like neurons responded to capsaicin administration with a brief (<5 min) inhibition of activity followed by an enhanced inhibition to noxious stimulation and a novel inhibition to innocuous stimulation (CRD and heat) at early time points (10 min post capsaicin). These results support the hypothesis that noxious visceral stimulation may cause referred hypersensitivity by promoting long-lasting sensitization of RVM ON-like cells. © 2009 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.},

abstract={In a seasonal environment, subcutaneous energy reserves of resident animals often increase in winter and decline again in summer reflecting gradual seasonal changes in their fattening strategies. We studied changes in body reserves of wintering great tits in relation to their dominance status under two contrasting temperature regimes to see whether individuals are capable of optimizing their body mass even under extreme environmental conditions. We predicted that dominant individuals will carry a lesser amount of body reserves than subordinate great tits under mild conditions and that the body reserves of the same dominant individuals will increase and exceed the amount of reserves of subordinates under conditions of extremely low ambient temperatures, when ambient temperature dropped down to -37 °C. The results confirmed the predictions showing that dominant great tits responded to the rising risk of starvation under low temperatures by increasing their body reserves and this was done at the expense of their safety. Removal experiments revealed that lower body reserves of subordinate flock members are due to the increased intraspecific competition for food under low ambient temperatures. Our results also showed that fattening strategies of great tits may change much quicker than previously considered, reflecting an adaptive role of winter fattening which is sensitive to changes in ambient temperatures. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Repetitive behaviors and hyperactivity are common features of developmental disorders, including autism. Neuropathology of the cerebellum is also a frequent occurrence in autism and other developmental disorders. Recent studies have indicated that cerebellar pathology may play a causal role in the generation of repetitive and hyperactive behaviors. In this study, we examined the relationship between cerebellar pathology and these behaviors in a mouse model of Purkinje cell loss. Specifically, we made aggregation chimeras between Lc/+ mutant embryos and +/+ embryos. Lc/+ mice lose 100% of their Purkinje cells postnatally due to a cell-intrinsic gain-of-function mutation. Through our histological examination, we demonstrated that Lc/+↔+/+ chimeric mice have Purkinje cells ranging from zero to normal numbers. Our analysis of these chimeric cerebella confirmed previous studies on Purkinje cell lineage. The results of both open-field activity and hole-board exploration testing indicated negative relationships between Purkinje cell number and measures of activity and investigatory nose-poking. Additionally, in a progressive-ratio operant paradigm, we found that Lc/+ mice lever-pressed significantly less than +/+ controls, which led to significantly lower breakpoints in this group. In contrast, chimeric mice lever-pressed significantly more than controls and this repetitive lever-pressing behavior was significantly and negatively correlated with total Purkinje cell numbers. Although the performance of Lc/+ mice is probably related to their motor deficits, the significant relationships between Purkinje cell number and repetitive lever-pressing behavior as well as open-field activity measures provide support for a role of cerebellar pathology in generating repetitive behavior and increased activity in chimeric mice. © 2010 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Tauopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative dementias involving perturbations in the levels, phosphorylation, or mutations of the microtubule-binding protein Tau. The heterogeneous pathology in humans and model organisms suggests differential susceptibility of neuronal types to wild-type (WT) and mutant Tau. WT and mutant human Tau-encoding transgenes expressed panneuronally in the Drosophila CNS yielded specific and differential toxicity in the embryonic neuroblasts that generate themushroombody (MB) neurons, suggesting cell type-specific effects of Tau in the CNS. Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17-linked mutant isoforms were significantly less toxic in MB development. Tau hyperphosphorylation was essential for these MB aberrations, and we identified two novel putative phosphorylation sites, Ser238 and Thr245, on WT hTau essential for its toxic effects on MB integrity. Significantly, blocking putative Ser238 and Thr 245 phosphorylation yielded animals with apparently structurally normal but profoundly dysfunctional MBs, because animals accumulating this mutant protein exhibited strongly impaired associative learning. Interestingly, the mutant protein was hyperphosphorylated at epitopes typically associated with toxicity and neurodegeneration, such as AT8, AT100, and the Par-1 targets Ser262 and Ser356, suggesting that these sites in the context of adult intact MBs mediate dysfunction and occupation of these sites may precede the toxicity-associated Ser238 and Thr245 phosphorylation. The data support the notion that phosphorylation at particular sites rather than hyperphosphorylation per se mediates toxicity or dysfunction in a cell type-specific manner.

abstract={Focusing attention is a way for animals to search for and to obtain food efficiently. This study examines whether a sit-and-wait forager, the orb-web spider Cyclosa octotuberculata, focuses its attention on limited foraging areas. Video records of foraging activity revealed that the spiders detected prey trapped in the west and east sectors of their web less frequently than prey trapped in the north and south sectors. Comparison of photos of the web hub area with and without spiders present revealed that the spiders pulled radii towards the centre when waiting for prey. Radius pulling is stronger in the north and south web sectors than in the west and east sectors, possibly causing more tension in radii running vertically. Experimental manipulation indicated that the spiders responded to prey quicker when thread tension was increased. The results suggest that C. octotuberculata focus their attention on the web areas above and below the spider by adjusting the tension in web threads; and this causes higher prey detection rates in these areas. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Ghrelin is a hormone produced mainly by P/D1 cells which line the fundus of the stomach and epsilon cells of the pancreas that stimulate hunger. Ghrelin exists in an endocrinologicaly inactive (des-acyl ghrelin) and active (noctanoyl-modified ghrelin) forms. The serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK-1) is a member of the AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinase. In this study, mice were isolated individually or in groups, and deprived from food supply for a period of 24-h. Despite decreases in plasma corticosterone levels and no changes in plasma des-acyl ghrelin, and the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin, plasma active ghrelin levels and the expression of hypothalamic SGK-1 increased in the acute-isolated mice. Injection of SGK-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide into the third cerebral ventricle suppressed the acute social isolation-induced decreases in body weight and increases in plasma active ghrelin levels. Pretreatment with phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist) but not alprenolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist), partially but significantly suppressed the decreases in body weight induced by acute isolation stress. These finding suggest that isolation stress is a novel inducer of hypothalamic SGK-1 expression. SGK-1 might contribute to the isolation stress-induced body weight reductions and increases in plasma active ghrelin levels via, at least partly, altered central autonomic outflow in mice.},

abstract={Natural selection affects emotional and behavioural patterns, such as anti-predator adaptations, that enhance human survival. Fear is a basic emotion that activates behavioural responses upon encountering a predator, being consistently higher in females than in males. In this study, we investigated associations between fear of a large carnivore predator and perceived physical condition in a sample of Slovakian participants (n = 943). When testing evolutionary hypotheses explaining gender differences in fear of predators, we found partial support for the "physical condition" hypothesis, because females either reported lower perceived body condition than males and their perceived body condition showed significant correlation with fear of brown bear, Ursus arctos. The negative association between fear and perceived body condition was stronger in males suggesting that fear evolved as a response to higher predation pressures on males in our evolutionary past, indirectly supporting the "prédation pressure" hypothesis. Males and participants with higher fear of bears wanted to exterminate bears by shooting more than others, suggesting that future management strategies should be oriented on elimination of fear of predators, as primary predictor of extremely negative attitudes toward bears. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2010.},

abstract={The influence of diet and food distribution on the socioecology of group-living species has long been debated, particularly for primates. It has typically been assumed that folivorous primates experience relatively little feeding competition due to the abundant, widespread nature of their food, freeing them to form large groups in response to predation, to disperse with relative ease, and to have egalitarian female social relationships. Recent studies, however, have come to different conclusions about the extent to which folivorous primates are limited by food and experience food competition and how these factors affect folivore socioecology. To better understand the selective pressures that diet places on folivores, we investigated how 2 small highly folivorous groups of colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, responded behaviorally and physiologically to a steep reduction in availability of their most important foods. The monkeys decreased their reliance on their 2 most frequently eaten food species and increased their daily path length, number of feeding patches visited/day, size of individual feeding areas, percentage of time spent feeding, and dietary diversity. They also showed evidence of physiological costs, in that lactating females' urinary C-peptide levels (i.e., insulin production) declined as top foods became scarce, and parasite loads slightly, but significantly, increased in 2 of 3 adult females examined. These results suggest that highly folivorous primates, even in very small groups, may experience behavioral and physiological effects of food limitation, within-group scramble competition for food, and possibly substantial selective pressures during periods of food scarcity.},

abstract={Within a season, successive generations of short-lived organisms experience different combinations of environmental parameters, such as temperature, food quality and mortality risk. Adult body size of e. g. insects is therefore expected to vary both as a consequence of proximate environmental effects as well as adaptive responses to seasonal cues. In this study, we examined intraspecific differences in body size between successive generations in 12 temperate bivoltine moths (Lepidoptera), with the ultimate goal to critically compare the role of proximate and adaptive mechanisms in determining seasonal size differences. In nearly all species, individuals developing late in the season (diapausing generation) attained a larger adult size than their conspecifics with the larval period early in the season (directly developing generation) despite the typically lower food quality in late summer. Rearing experiments conducted on one of the studied species, Selenia tetralunaria also largely exclude the possibility that the proximate effects of food quality and temperature are decisive in determining size differences between successive generations. Adaptive explanations appear likely instead: the larger body size in the diapausing generation may be adaptively associated with the lower bird predation pressure late in the season, and/or the likely advantage of large pupal size during overwintering. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={The pace of reproductive aging has been of considerable interest, especially in regard to the long postreproductive period in modern women. Here we use data for both sexes from a 37-year longitudinal study of a wild baboon population to place reproductive aging within a life history context for this species, a primate relative of humans that evolved in the same savannah habitat as humans did. We examine the patterns and pace of reproductive aging, including birth rates and reproductive hormones for both sexes, and compare reproductive aging to age-related changes in several other traits. Reproductive senescence occurs later in baboon females than males. Delayed senescence in females relative to males is also found in several other traits, such as dominance status and body condition, but not in molar wear or glucocorticoid profiles. Survival, health, and well-being are the product of risk factors in morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits that differ in rate of senescence and in dependence on social or ecological conditions; some will be very sensitive to differences in circumstances and others less so. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Under sexual conflict, males evolve traits to increase their mating and reproductive success that impose costs on females. Females evolve counteradaptations to resist males and reduce those costs. Sexual harassment is a form of sexual conflict in which males make repeated, costly attempts to mate. Costs to female foraging or predation risk have been measured in several species, but quantitative measurements of direct fitness costs are rare. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), males harass females, and females resist all mating attempts. We placed bees in large, outdoor cages with various male-biased sex ratios. Harassment rate, nest progression, offspring production, temperature, and food availability were measured daily for 7 days. Harassment rates were highest at intermediate sex ratios. Harassment reduced the number of foraging trips and increased the duration of foraging trips made by females. Females produced offspring at a slower rate when subjected to higher rates of harassment. This shows a direct link from sex ratio to harassment to female fitness under natural conditions. We also discuss an alternative explanation that female resistance is a mechanism for mate choice for high-quality males, which would require that indirect benefits accrue through either daughters or grandsons, because all sons in haplodiploid species arise from unfertilized eggs. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={The developmental hypothesis proposes that the adrenocortical response to stress during postnatal development in birds should not develop when the benefits of elevated corticosterone do not outweigh the deleterious effects on growth and development. We tested three predictions developed from this hypothesis in free-living, semi-altricial Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus nestlings. We measured baseline and handling-induced corticosterone levels and the binding capacity of corticosteroid binding globulins CBG on day 10 and 21 of age and related these to age, the development of the defence behaviour, hatching asynchrony and fat stores (a measure of body condition). First, the adrenocortical response to handling (total plasma corticosterone) increased with age and thus during the time when nestlings developed the ability to defend themselves, but free corticosterone did not, because of a concomitant increase of CBG with age. Second, nestlings with adequate fat stores mounted a stronger adrenocortical stress response to an acute stressor, while nestlings with low fat stores avoided additional energy expenses. While baseline corticosterone levels were negatively related to fat stores, increase in corticosterone to handling was positively related. Third, both baseline corticosterone levels and the adrenocortical response to handling were not related to hatching order, but predominantly determined by body condition. The pattern of decreasing corticosterone levels with hatching order found in the lab seems to be neutralized by opposite effects of varying body condition on corticosterone levels in free-living birds. We argue that the postnatal adrenocortical response to stress is adaptively modulated by both variations in the release of corticosterone and in CBG, which is particularly important because elevated corticosterone may adversely affect the phenotype. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: Extremely low body mass index (BMI) values are associated with increased risk for death and poor long-term prognosis in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). The present study explores childhood personality characteristics that could be associated with the ability to attain an extremely low BMI. Methods: Participants were 326 women from the Genetics of Anorexia Nervosa (GAN) Study who completed the Structured Interview for Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimic Syndromes and whose mother completed the Child Behavioral Checklist and/or Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey. Results: Children who were described as having greater fear or anxiety by their mothers attained lower BMIs during AN (p < 0.02). Path analysis in the GAN and a validation sample, Price Foundation Anorexia Nervosa Trios Study, confirmed the relation between early childhood anxiety, caloric restriction, qualitative food item restriction, excessive exercise, and low BMI. Path analysis also confirmed a relation between childhood anxiety and caloric restriction, which mediated the relation between childhood anxiety and low BMI in the GAN sample only. Conclusion: Fearful or anxious behavior as a child was associated with the attainment of low BMI in AN and childhood anxiety was associated with caloric restriction. Measures of anxiety and factors associated with anxiety-proneness in childhood may index children at risk for restrictive behaviors and extremely low BMIs in AN. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The recent formation of a migratory divide in the blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) involves sympatrically breeding birds migrating to different overwintering quarters. Within the last 50 years, a novel migratory strategy has evolved resulting in an increasing proportion of birds now wintering in Britain instead of migrating to the traditional sites in the Mediterranean area. This rapid microevolution has been attributed to allochronic spring arrival of migrants from the respective wintering quarters leading to assortative mating. Moreover, blackcaps wintering in Britain may experience fitness advantages owing to improved local wintering conditions. We used stable hydrogen isotope signatures (δD) to scrutinize the degree of temporal segregation of blackcaps upon spring arrival and to test for carry-over effects in body condition associated with the disparate wintering environments. Although we found that migrants from Britain arrive significantly earlier on German breeding grounds than migrants from the Mediterranean region, we also found a considerable overlap in arrival times. In a resampling model, the mean probability of assortative mating of birds wintering in Britain is ≤28% in both years. These results suggest that allochrony alone is not a strong isolating barrier between the two subpopulations. Migrants from both wintering locations did not differ in terms of body mass, mass-tarsus residuals or mass-tarsus ratio and arrived in a similar reproductive disposition. Thus, blackcaps wintering in Britain do not gain an apparent fitness advantage on spring migration due to carry-over effects in body condition. Future studies should explore additional factors such as differences in song quality and habitat that might contribute to the rapid microevolution of the blackcap. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract={Intermittent locomotion, characterized by moves interspersed with pauses, is a common pattern of locomotion in animals, but its ecological and evolutionary significance relative to continuous locomotion remains poorly understood. Although many studies have examined individual differences in both intermittent locomotion and boldness separately, to our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship between these 2 traits. Characterizing and understanding this relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was correlated with body size or body condition. This study provides the first empirical evidence for a link between an animal "personality" trait and intermittent locomotion.},

abstract={Oxidative stress is associated with the aging process, a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, and decreased by reduced energy intake. Oxidative modifications can affect protein function; the sulfur-containing amino acids, including methionine, are particularly susceptible to oxidation. A methionine sulfoxide can be enzymatically reduced by the methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) system. Previously, we have shown that MsrA-/- mice exhibit altered locomotor activity and brain dopamine levels as function of age. Previous studies have demonstrated that a caloric restriction enhances antioxidant defense and reduces the action of reactive oxygen species. Here we examine locomotor behavior and dopamine levels of MsrA-/- mice after caloric restriction starting at eight months of age and ending at 17 months. The MsrA-/- mice did not have any significant difference in spontaneous distance traveled when compared to controls at 17 months of age. In contrast, our previous report showed decreased locomotor activity in the MsrA-/- mice at 12 months of age and older when fed ad-libitum. After completion of the caloric restriction diet, dopamine levels were comparable to control mice. This differs from the abnormal dopamine levels previously observed in MsrA-/- mice fed ad-libitum. Thus, caloric restriction had a neutralization effect on MsrA ablation. In summary, it is suggested that caloric restriction alleviates abnormal locomotor activity and dopamine levels in the brain of the methionine sulfoxide reductase A knockout mouse. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women. They are characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior and weight regulation, and deviant attitudes and perceptions toward body weight and shape. In AN, an inexplicable fear of weight gain and unrelenting obsession with being fat, even in the face of increasing emaciation, accounts for a protracted course. BN usually emerges after a period of food restriction, which may or may not have been associated with weight loss. Binge eating is followed either by self-induced vomiting, or by other means of compensation for the excess of ingested food. There is growing acknowledgement that neurobiological vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to the pathogenesis of AN and BN, suggesting that altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function contributes to dysregulation of appetite, mood, and impulse control. Brain imaging studies, using 5-HT specific ligands, show that disturbances of 5-HT function occur when people are ill, and persist after recovery. It is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT neuronal modulation predates the onset of AN, and contributes to premorbid symptoms of anxiety, obsessionality and inhibition. This dysphoric temperament may involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional and reward pathways which also mediates the hedonic aspects of feeding, thus making these individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive behaviors. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary intake, by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which they can modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood. They enter a vicious cycle, because caloric restriction results in a brief respite from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn, produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function, which also exaggerates dysphoric mood. Thus, those with AN pursue starvation in an attempt to avoid the dysphoric consequences of eating. © 2010, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Preclinical and clinical data indicate the involvement of zinc in the pathophysiology and therapy of depression. A relationship between zinc-deficiency and depression symptoms was recently proposed. The present study investigated alterations in spontaneous locomotor activity and zinc concentrations in the serum, hippocampus and frontal cortex; these alterations were induced by subjecting rats to a zinc-deficient diet, prior subjected after birth to zinc-supplemented diet. Body weight was significantly reduced in animals subjected to the four-week zinc-deficient diet compared to those subjected to the zinc-adequate diet. The two-week zinc-deficient diet induced a significant increase in locomotor activity in all measured time periods (5, 30 and 60 min by 44-62%). The four-week zinc-deficient diet did not affect locomotor activity, while the six-week zinc-deficient diet resulted in a 45% increase in the 5 min time period. Serum zinc concentrations were significantly reduced (by 29%) in animals subjected to the four-week zinc-deficient diet but not in those subjected to the two- or six-week zinc-deficient diets. The zinc-deficient diet did not influence the zinc concentration in the examined brain regions regardless of the length. These results indicate that post-birth supplementation with zinc may protect zinc-deficient diet-induced rapid alterations in zinc homeostasis.

abstract={Neonatal ketamine (KET) or phencyclidine (PCP) treatment can trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in rodents. Previously, we described KET- and PCP-induced altered body weight and home cage, slant board and forelimb hang behaviors in preweaning rats (Boctor et al., 2008). In that study, l-carnitine (LC) attenuated the KET-induced behavioral alterations and body weight decrements. The four subcutaneous (sc) treatment groups were: (1) saline; (2) 10 mg/kg PCP on PNDs 7, 9 and 11; (3) 20 mg/kg KET (6 injections; one every 2 h on PND 7); or (4) a regimen of KET and 250 mg/kg LC (KLC) both administered on PND 7, with additional 250 mg/kg doses of LC on PNDs 8-11. A portion of each treatment group was evaluated for postweaning behaviors which included grip strength and motor coordination (postnatal days (PNDs) 22 or 71), locomotor sensitization (PND 42), spatial alternation (PNDs 22-70) and residential running wheel activity (PNDs 72-77). On PND 42 or 78, whole and regional brain weights were measured. Grip strength and motor coordination were unaffected at either age by neonatal treatment. On PND 42, neonatally treated KET- or KLC-treated rats responded to a challenge of 5 mg/kg KET with activity similar to controls that received the same challenge. Neonatal PCP treatment, however, induced significant sensitization to a challenge of 3 mg/kg PCP on PND 42 relative to controls that received the same challenge, causing increased activity which was especially profound in females. Performance on a continuous spatial alternation task requiring a "win-shift, lose-stay" strategy appeared unaffected by neonatal KET or KLC treatment. PCP treatment, however, caused significantly increased random responding and shorter choice latencies. In addition, neonatal PCP treatment elevated light and dark period running wheel activity and reduced PND 42 and 78 body and whole brain weights. These findings provide further evidence that PCP treatment on PNDs 7, 9, and 11 causes subtle cognitive deficits and long-term alterations in activity that are unrelated to deficits in grip strength or motor coordination. Further, repeated KET treatment on PND 7 does not appear to result in severe behavioral modifications.},

abstract={Predators are often unwilling to eat prey with novel appearances (so called dietary conservatism). It has repeatedly, although controversially, been argued that such wariness can contribute to the evolution of bright coloration in prey animals with effective secondary defences such as toxins. In this paper we report the results of novel evolutionary simulations in which bright prey emerge in otherwise cryptic, defended populations, and predators vary in their level of dietary wariness. A novel prediction from our simulations is that rare aposematic prey can evolve to a dynamic equilibrium with their cryptic conspecifics, and persist for long evolutionary timescales without ever reaching fixation in prey populations. Furthermore, we show that when conditions are more beneficial for new aposematic forms, for example because there are many palatable prey in a habitat, then dietary conservatism can indeed explain the evolution of aposematism, but the generality of this result was considerably restricted by variation in levels of dietary conservatism seen within predator populations and by increased predator longevity. We use the results to consider the case that 'receiver biases' could explain aposematism, rather than recently suggested models of signal reliability. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Social learning is predicted to be adaptive when independent learning is time-consuming, dangerous or difficult. For a naïve individual confronted with an array of novel foods, determining the nutritional value of unfamiliar foods can be challenging, and an increased reliance on social learning would be favoured by selection. I investigated whether the multimodal display of food calling and tid-bitting by white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens adaptively biases chicks' intake of foods of different nutrient content via social learning. Ptarmigan were observed in California's Sierra Nevada alpine for two summer seasons. In 116 foraging bouts, I observed 100 instances of hen food calling (to six plant species) and 100 responses by chicks. The relative proportion of each plant species in the chicks' diet was significantly and positively related to the proportion of food calls associated with that plant species, but not with its relative availability. Plant species that elicited food calls by hens had significantly more protein than did random mixtures of plants or than did foods eaten by the hens that did not elicit food calls. Chicks of hens that often uttered calls consumed diets significantly higher in protein than did chicks of hens that rarely called. Preferences were maintained as chicks became older and foraged further from their mothers, and food calling ceased, indicating social learning. Hens' food calling biased chicks' diet choices, supporting the prediction that socially acquired information plays a prominent role when an animal is seeking a nutrient that is difficult to identify (protein). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that ptarmigan hens engage in teaching, but further studies are required before it can be stated conclusively that they teach their chicks nutritional wisdom. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Pit-building antlion larvae are sit-and-wait predatory insects that construct conical pits, from which they ambush prey, in sandy soils. We examined the behavioural responses of antlions to the detection of various sized prey, which they were not allowed to capture. We found that antlions responded faster to smaller prey items, probably because larger prey may be considered a source of disturbance rather than a food source. Antlion response time to provided prey decreased after feeding and was negatively correlated with antlion body mass. Both of these results were indicative of a response to prey that depended on both internal and external factors. Pit dimensions increased with time at a constant rate among antlions in the unsuccessful prey capture or fed groups, but at a decelerating rate in the unfed control group. Contrary to our expectation, we could not detect differences in the rate of mass loss between antlions that were unfed and those experiencing unsuccessful prey captures. We also posited that antlions should exploit a specific prey type more efficiently as the number of encounters they had with it increased. However, there was no support for this prediction in our study. Exploring the responses of predators to prey in general, and in light of the conditions characterizing their natural habitat in particular, can improve our understanding of how predators adapt to cope with environmental variability. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={So how do we approach this epidemic? (And it is an epidemic.) Obesity is spreading from person to person and is hard to stop now that it is established. It is a public health issue that is best addressed by treatment of the group/community than the individual. Prevention, of course, is best. But for those patients who need treatment, we must address all 3 aspects of the problem. Individuals need to be educated as to health problems caused by their obesity, including the role of calories, lack of activity, and the lack of reasonable goals for weight loss. A recommendation of a loss of 10% of body weight is achievable and results in improved health. Physicians should emphasize that the goal of weight loss is for better health and not to fit into a size-6 dress. Patients should be taught that a change in nutritional behavior improves health and is not a punishment for a lack of self-control. The dietary strategy a patient chooses is not as critical as the ability for the patient to remain compliant with the dietary modification. As obstetric-gynecology providers we need to have candid discussions withwomenduring pregnancy about weight gain expectations since they may be more motivated to adopt a healthier eating style during pregnancy. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy appears to create an intrauterine environment that promotes larger infants with more fat cells. This in turn puts the child at higher risk for obesity during childhood and as an adult with all the long-term consequences. In fact we have reached the situation where children born now are projected to have a shorter life span than their parents-this is primarily due to the obesity crisis. Governmental agencies need to make healthier foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, more accessible and affordable through subsidies and then distribute through state and federal programs. Some health proponents have promoted the idea of taxing sweetened soft drinks and other high-caloric, low-nutrition foods: the so-called Fat Tax. Heightened tax rates have helped to decrease the consumption of cigarettes. Because soft drinks and fast foods are major sources of excessive calories with little nutritional value, the fat tax may have some support among those who believe behavioral change can be achieved through taxation and penalties. The new Health Care Reform package has a requirement that all commercial establishments must post the caloric content of items they sell. This is already in effect in New York State. Speaking for myself, this modified my food selection in the LaGuardia Airport as I waited to catch a plane. Finally, a patient's community needs to support an individual's decision to lose weight. Many patients are sabotaged by their immediate family, coworkers, and other members of their community. Rather than support an individual's decision to modify behavior, members of an individual's social network often provide calorie-laden foods, insist on eating at restaurants with limited healthy choices, and refuse to support the individual when they try to free up time to exercise. Pregnant women are often given permission by family and community to eat for 2 and to follow cravings since obviously the baby needs it. As obstetrician-gynecologists we need to stress to our patients the Institute of Medicine recommendations (which many feel are already too liberal). This is a population where counseling has an impact. Given 80% of the weight gained in the first half of the pregnancy is retained long term, this is an excellent time for prevention. Although many individuals state it is their genetic makeup that causes them to be fat, this is not supported in the data. An obese friend has a greater influence than an obese sibling for a person to become obese-environment trumps genetics. Community leadership needs to provide safe areas to walk or exercise, support farmer's markets or grocery stores, and encourage healthy choices that are consistent with cultural roots. Pharmaceutical agents and surgical interventions have been developed and are successful adjuncts to weight loss. However, they are not the magic bullet. If the patient has a psychological motivation for overeating that is not addressed prior to or with these interventions, the weight will return despite continued use of the intervention often as fast as it was initially lost. Obesity is clearly a national epidemic that is occurring due to economic and cultural pressures that make high-calorie foodsreadily available and culturally acceptable, a shifting national norm of what is acceptable weight, and decreased emphasis by individuals and the greater community on healthy life choices.7 Diets and weight loss pills are not the answer. Prevention is key. For individuals who are already obese, the health care system needs to provide motivational counseling, nutritional education, and family counseling. The most effective motivation continues to be that of improved health and better quality of life, not achieving some external expectation that can not be achieved by most of the population. Obesity needs to be treated as a chronic disease with multiple treatment cycles and not a personal failing of willpower. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Animals can reduce their uncertainty of predation risk by attuning to antipredator behavior of others or assessing the risk for themselves. Although it has never been empirically examined in the context of predation, we predicted that animals combine information gleaned from others with their own sampling experience to estimate risk. To test this prediction, we assessed the state-dependent mobbing responses of migrant and resident songbirds at a fall migration stopover site in eastern Canada to stimuli simulating a range of predation risk situations. We presented individuals with social cues in the form of playbacks of black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mob-calls conveying graded information about predator size in combination with a predator model (one of two owl species) that rendered the social information either correct or incorrect. The response did not differ based on migratory state; both migrant and resident birds stayed longer at experimental trials when presented with erroneous social information. In particular, response duration of birds presented with a low-threat chickadee mob-call and a high-threat model (understating the risk) was substantially longer than the response to other low-threat call trials, suggesting that individuals were capable of Bayesian updating by devaluing the social cue and acting on their own assessment.

abstract={Background & Aims: In human beings, as in most vertebrates, the release of the intestinal peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) by ingested food plays a major role both in digestion and the regulation of further food intake, but the changes in brain function and their underlying activation mechanisms remain unknown. Our aim was to explore, using a novel physiologic magnetic resonance imaging approach, the temporospatial brain activation matrix, in response to ingestion of a lipid meal and, by use of a CCK-1 receptor antagonist, to define the role of CCK in this activation. Methods: We studied, in 19 healthy subjects, the brain activation responses to ingested lipid (dodecanoic acid) or saline (control) with magnetic resonance imaging. Gallbladder volume, plasma CCK levels, and subjective hunger and fullness scores were also recorded. The experiment was then repeated, with and without prior administration of the CCK-1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide (600 mg orally) with a controlled, randomized order, latin-square design. Results: Ingested lipid activated bilaterally a matrix of brain areas, particularly the brain stem, pons, hypothalamus, and also cerebellum and motor cortical areas. These activations were abolished by dexloxiglumide, indicating a CCK-mediated pathway, independent of any nutrient-associated awareness cues. Conclusion: The identification of these activations now defines the lipid-activated brain matrix and provides a means by which the gut-derived homeostatic mechanisms of food regulation can be distinguished from secondary sensory and hedonic cues, thereby providing a new approach to exploring aberrant human gastrointestinal responses and eating behavior. © 2010 AGA Institute.},

abstract={Specialized predators must obtain all required nutrients from a single prey species. In some species nutrient balance may be possible by selecting various body parts. We tested how different ant body parts affect the fitness of a specialized ant predator and whether the predator possesses adaptations in its feeding behaviour that allow nutrient balancing while feeding on only a single prey species. We used a formicine-specialist spider, Zodarion rubidum, reared on three diet types: an entire ant, two ant gasters and two ant foreparts (heads, thoraces and legs) of Lasius ants. Spiders grew faster, survived longer and developed earlier on the diet consisting of two ant foreparts. Spiders fed on the two ant gasters had the slowest growth, highest mortality and slowest development while spiders fed entire ants showed intermediate performance. In preference experiments, we studied the spiders' consumption of three Formicinae ant species that differ markedly in size. With small Lasius ants, spiders equally exploited the gaster and the foreparts, but with larger Formica and Camponotus ants, spiders fed significantly more on the foreparts than on the gaster. Spiders almost always fed on the gaster, suggesting that it might include beneficial nutrients. Nutritional analysis of the ant bodies of the three species revealed that there were more lipids in the gaster, while the foreparts contained more proteins. Our results suggest that ant-eating spiders might balance their nutritional needs by selectively consuming various body parts of their exclusive prey. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract={Basal termites possess two developmental features that eusocial Hymenoptera lack: the majority of colony members are juveniles whose somatic and reproductive development is temporarily or permanently suspended, and individual development is characterized by extreme phenotypic plasticity. An examination of the literature indicates that the basis for these unique ontogenetic characters is not the prolongation of a pronymphal stage into postembryonic development, as recently suggested. Like other hemimetabolous insects, termites have three embryonic cuticles, and the pronymphal (EC3) cuticle is shed during or shortly after hatch. Nonetheless, a different developmental landmark, dorsal closure, occurs later during embryogenesis in termites than it does in their cockroach relatives, clearly indicating ontogenetic repatterning from an ancestral state. An alternate hypothesis for the origin of isopteran phenotypic plasticity becomes apparent if we remain focused on the phylogenetic and social context of termite evolution. Altricial development occurs in both vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, evolves in response to the parental environment, and is displayed by two distantly related, biparental, wood-feeding cockroaches, including Cryptocercus, the sister-group to termites. It is therefore likely the condition was present in subsocial termite ancestors, and played a complex, multidimensional role in the transition to eusociality. Most relevant to current arguments is that a shift in responsibility for the care of altricial dependents, from parents to the first nutritionally independent nymphs in the family (alloparents), resulted in the developmental stasis of alloparents at a relatively young age. Because early instar cockroaches are not metamorphically competent, these young alloparents would have provided a novel developmental template on which selection could act. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Developmental plasticity is the process by which environmental cues in early life influence the nature of the phenotype. The nearuniversal capacity for plasticity evolved because it allows the organism to maintain or enhance its fitness, either at the time of the challenge (by allowing survival) or later in life. Importantly, developmental plasticity operates over the normative range of environmental experiences. Studies of the long-term consequences of different developmental environments for human health and disease have shown that growth restriction (altered birth size) is not a prerequisite for altered disease risk and that there is a graded effect across the whole range of fetal milieu. Thus, the emerging consensus is that 'fetal programming' reflects the maladaptive consequences of developmental plasticity, arising from discordance between the triggering and later environments. Such discordance is increasingly likely, both because of demographic shifts and because of the rapid change in the nutritional and social environments experienced after weaning. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The present article presents epidemiological, and comparative evidence supporting the hypothesis that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may represent a thrifty adaptation selected to compel animals to minimize voluntary energy expenditure. The autoimmune, pathophysiological manifestations underlying RA are framed here as constituting an evolved, protective mechanism that would have influenced animals to avoid exertion and maintain a sedentary lifestyle in order to minimize metabolic output and ultimately escape starvation. Arthritic pain is characterized here as a defensive, innate signal much like fatigue, fever, nausea and reflexive pain, and like these, is seen on a continuum varying between imperceptible encumbrance and debilitating disability. The epigenetic relationship between acute psychological stress and flare-up of arthritic symptoms is examined and taken to suggest that arthritis may be a predictive, adaptive response to severe stress allowing reductions in metabolism to follow adverse conditions or nutritional scarcity. The close associations between rheumatoid arthritis and the metabolic syndrome are also explored along with potential ties to the "thrifty genotype" and "thrifty phenotype" phenomena. This hypothesis is examined in the contexts of evolutionary medicine, phenotypic plasticity, the stress response and the bioenergetics of thrift. A brief and exploratory review of pertinent evidence suggests that RA, its subclinical manifestations, and even other forms of arthropathy may possibly represent adaptations that promoted metabolic thrift during our evolutionary past. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), due either to maternal, placental, or genetic factors, may permanently alter the endocrine-metabolic status of the fetus, driving an insulin resistance state that can promote survival at the short term but that facilitates the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome in adult life, especially when the intrauterine nutrient restriction is followed by a postnatal obesogenic environment. Furthermore, an energy-rich environment during fetal programming may also drive the development of excess abdominal fat and type 2 diabetes in later life, demonstrating that both intrauterine nutrient restriction as well as intrauterine nutrient excessive supply may predispose for the development of adult diabetes. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Introduction: The concept of developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) has radically altered the fields of reproductive and developmental biology. The pursuit of developmental mechanisms used to be a rather intrinsic exercise, probing how the embryo or later stage progressed along the road to adult form, with attention paid to morphogenesis, body patterning, cell differentiation, regulated proliferation, intercellular communication and the like. Since David Barker and colleagues first demonstrated that human health across the world in different populations and circumstances can be determined to a large extent by prenatal environment and the quality of maternal nutrition, the scope of developmental biology has changed forever. There is now an appreciation that extrinsic factors interact with the core developmental process, providing ‘plasticity’ in phenotype which recognizes the biological continuum that exists from one generation to the next. One enduring idea is that plasticity during development allows an organism to ‘select’ the phenotype best suited to its future environment from a given genotype, mediated through factors associated with nutrient availability. The matching of phenotype to environment makes good evolutionary sense, but if nutrient availability changes from that ‘predicted’ during the period of developmental plasticity, the mismatch can lead to an increased risk of adult disease. In eutherian mammals, the extended care provided by the mother throughout pregnancy provides ample opportunity for plasticity, or developmental programming, to play its part in shaping adult phenotype. © Cambridge University Press 2011.},

abstract={Decomposing stature into its major components is proving to be a useful strategy to assess the antecedents of disease, morbidity and death in adulthood. Human leg length (femur + tibia), sitting height (trunk length + head length) and their proportions, for example, (leg length/stature), or the sitting height ratio (sitting height/stature × 100), among others) are associated with epidemiological risk for overweight (fatness), coronary heart disease, diabetes, liver dysfunction and certain cancers. There is also wide support for the use of relative leg length as an indicator of the quality of the environment for growth during infancy, childhood and the juvenile years of development. Human beings follow a cephalo-caudal gradient of growth, the pattern of growth common to all mammals. A special feature of the human pattern is that between birth and puberty the legs grow relatively faster than other post-cranial body segments. For groups of children and youth, short stature due to relatively short legs (i.e., a high sitting height ratio) is generally a marker of an adverse environment. The development of human body proportions is the product of environmental x genomic interactions, although few if any specific genes are known. The HOXd and the short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) are genomic regions that may be relevant to human body proportions. For example, one of the SHOX related disorders is Turner syndrome. However, research with non-pathological populations indicates that the environment is a more powerful force influencing leg length and body proportions than genes. Leg length and proportion are important in the perception of human beauty, which is often considered a sign of health and fertility. © 2010 by the author.},

abstract={Personality is crucial for understanding health in later life. Yet classic conceptions of personality with emphasis on stability may have limited the empirical attention it deserved in relation to health. This chapter highlights the six foci of a personality model that integrates structures and processes within a level-ofanalysis framework that affords increased opportunities for health interventions and changes. The first level of the six-foci model includes traits, the broad and universal descriptions of a person that are relatively stable across time, and states, the moment-to-moment changes a person experiences. The second level of the six-foci model is composed of personal action constructs that emphasize the goal directedness of behavior and the self-regulatory processes involved in working toward goals. The third level of the six-foci model includes the life story, and processes of self-narration, such as remembering, reminiscing, and storytelling necessary for creating life stories. Brief reviews of relevant health research and suggestions for future research are highlighted in the overview. A compass metaphor portrays the dynamics and overall direction that personality provides for developmental health trajectories and lives. Results from the UNC Alumni Heart Study, a long-term longitudinal study of traits and risk factors for disease and health outcomes, are reviewed. The emerging literature on personality and its relationship to Alzheimer's disease is also examined. The last section of the chapter is a review of micro-longitudinal, state-like "in situ" studies of personality and health with dense measurements over more limited temporal spans. The time-sampling studies require new methodological approaches that are providing intriguing new evidence of how personality in context creates health and increases our understanding of development in adulthood. © 2010 Springer Publishing Company.},

abstract={In this second paper of the Brain, Drugs and Genes review we would like to discuss illicit drugs and the genetics that may predispose subjects to addiction. We describe the effects, action sites and pathophysiological consequences of the use of these illicit drugs. The drugs that are reviewed are marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA, also known as ecstasy. All of them cause an effect on the brain, modifying the activity of the neuronal systems, altering the activity or availability of the neurotransmitters or emulating their actions. The risk of dependence is related to the velocity with which these drugs induce plastic changes in the brain, very much like a learning process. Such changes underlie the patient's dependence to drugs. Therefore when a long term user quits and deprives the brain abruptly of these drugs, an abstinence syndrome is precipitated and it may be quite severe. Only for marijuana it seems to be mild, misleading people to believe this drug does not cause physical dependence. Marijuana (Cannabis sativa) is a plant which has its active principle Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in almost all its parts, i. e. the flowers, stems, seeds and leaves. It actually contains over 60 cannabinoids as well as other chemical compounds. Marijuana causes euphoria followed by relaxation and several other reinforcing effects. Among the adverse effects marijuana causes: alteration of short-term memory, slowness of reflexes, depression and anxiety, bronchitis and lung infections. Marijuana effects depend on the activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors, distributed in the entire body. The CB1 receptor is mainly present in the brain. In medicine, Δ9-THC has been useful in treating symptoms caused by chemotherapy, and in treating the anorexia caused by the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Also, an antagonist of the CB1 receptor, Rimonabant, has been used to treat morbid obesity with certain degree of success. However, despite this promising application of Rimonabant, the side effects it caused led to its withdrawal from the market in Europe, Canada and Mexico. Heroin, derived from morphine, which in turn is isolated from opium, causes euphoria and analgesia, suppresses hunger, increases energy and induces sleepiness. The adverse effects are liver and kidney diseases as well as a decrease in breathing and heart rates. This drug acts on the opioid receptors: MOR, DOR and KOR. Cocaine, derived from the coca plant (Erythroxylum coca) produces immediate rewarding effects that last between 30 to 60 min, and causes anxiety once its serum concentration drops. Due to its very short half-life, it is the most addictive of all drugs. Cocaine reduces hunger, thirst and sleep. The most used forms of cocaine are powder and crack (available as rock). The mechanism of action by which cocaine and related compounds induce their effects is the blockade of the dopamine transporter at the synapsis, leaving dopamine available for a longer time at the synapses of the motivation-reward system. Cocaine and related compounds induce blood vessel constriction, muscular spasm, chest pain, and an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk of cardiac arrest and stroke. The methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant, is a crystalline, odorless, bitter drug which causes a pleasant feeling and euphoria. Its action mechanism is the blockade of the dopamine transporter, same as cocaine. The effects pursued by the users of crystal methamphetamine are increased alertness, increase in physical activity and decrease in hunger. Its side effects include increase in body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, thus augmenting the risk for stroke. Methamphetamine also triggers violent behavior, anxiety, irritability, confusion, paranoia and hallucinations. This compound has been used for medical reasons, such as in the treatment of narcolepsy and obesity. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA or ecstasy, is a synthetic compound with stimulant and hallucinatory effects. Its action is exerted mainly on the serotonin transporter, leaving serotonin available at the synapsis for a longer time. After clearance from the bloodstream this drug causes severe depression. Ecstasy is also combined with other stimulants. All the drugs discussed here induce body changes that compromise the life of the user, or his health at the very least. Despite this fact, the highly reinforcing effects the drugs produce by over activating the motivation-rewarding system compel their repetitive use. Not all users, however, are equally vulnerable to becoming addicted or respond the same way to the use of drugs. The individual response depends, in part, on genetic factors, as we discuss in the following section. It is evident that not only environmental factors account for the vulnerability to addiction. Genetic factors also have a substantial contribution. In order to facilitate the understanding of the interaction environment-gene, we define the following concepts: gene, allele, mutation, polymorphism, heritability and epigenesis. Apparently, the genetic contribution to addiction vulnerability varies depending on the drug. For example, cocaine and opiates are much more dependant on genetic factors to trigger addiction than are nicotine, alcohol or marijuana. Mutations or polymorphisms carried by several genes might make the difference between being at high or low risk for addiction. They may also underlie the degree of response to rehabilitation treatments. Addiction, then, is a result of an interaction between environment and genes. Environmental demands make the organism modify its structure and physiology in order to cope efficiently to such demands. One crucial way to do so is by changing gene expression. Changes in gene expression may be a consequence of chemical rearrangements in the chromatin structure, which lead to transcriptional modifications that affect the expression of the proteins the genes encode. Consequently, the normal functions of such proteins in different systems are also altered. These adaptive rearrangements in the chromatin structure are called epigenesis. The epigenetic changes induced by environmental stimuli have been proved to affect the expression of several neurotransmitter receptors and trophic factors, among many other molecules crucial for the proper functioning of the Central Nervous System. Hence, these chromatin's structural changes, triggered by environmental demands, are most likely to help the subject cope with such specific demands. However, this adaptation is not free of charge, and requires a toll to be paid which is: vulnerability to addiction. Finally, one question arises: Who is the person most likely to seek a drug of abuse? Statistics have shown that those patients suffering from a psychiatric illness. This hypothesis suggests that addiction is a symptom or a disease caused by a psychiatric illness such as a personality disorder, depression or schizophrenia. Hence, at the end, drug addiction would be a co-morbid entity, generating what in Spanish we call the dual-disease. On the other hand, the self-medication hypothesis also makes sense, at least for an extensive group of patients. This hypothesis suggests that patients take drugs of abuse to relief the symptoms caused by their psychiatric pathology. The present review discusses the interaction between brain circuits, drugs and genes to generate an addict patient. We do not intend to revise each field exhaustively, but rather we intend to give the reader a general scenario on the convergence of these three worlds. Thus it may be better understood how addiction develops and how it may be treated.},

abstract={Despite variations across individuals and agents, antipsychotics are associated with clearly documented weight gain and adverse metabolic effects. Although increased appetite/caloric intake and various receptors, hormones and peptides have been implicated, biological mechanisms contributing to the increase in weight and glucose and lipid abnormalities with antipsychotics are largely unknown. This has hampered the creation of antipsychotics that are free of cardiometabolic effects, even in antipsychotic-naive/early-phase patients, as well as the development of strategies that can prevent or drastically diminish the adverse cardiometabolic effects. In general, three strategies can reduce the cardiometabolic risk of antipsychotics: switching to a less orexigenic/metabolically adverse antipsychotic; adjunctive behavioral treatments; and adjunctive pharmacologic interventions. However, each of these strategies has only been shown to be modestly effective. Among different behavioral interventions (N = 14, n = 746), group and individual treatment, dietary counseling and cognitive-behavioral therapy seem to be similarly effective. Among 15 different pharmacologic strategies (N = 35, n = 1629), only metformin, fenfluramine, sibutramine, topiramate and reboxetine were more effective than placebo, with the most evidence being available for metformin, and no head-to-head trials comparing individual pharmacologic interventions. However, even in the most successful trials the risk reduction was modest. Weight was not decreased to a pretreatment level, and despite superiority compared with placebo, weight gain still often occurred, particularly in antipsychotic-naive patients and when interventions were 'preventively coinitiated with antipsychotics. Future research should focus on combining treatment modalities or agents and on exploring novel mechanism-based interventions. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.},
